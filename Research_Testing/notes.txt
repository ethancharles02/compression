Compress bits first with a normal bit reduction or pattern reduction method. Then diagonalize them into a grid for the picross reduction?
Flip bits in each column and row to have the highest possible compressibility and decompressibility rating (come up with an algorithm for compressibility and decompressibility ratings)
Instead of specifying single bits, maybe just specify their location on the grid since they can't be compressed, maybe the same with 2s

If a compressed file already exists, the user should be given an option to overwrite or not
