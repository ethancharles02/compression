THE BOOK OF <14

An <95 <95
 BY THE HAND OF <13

UPON PLATES TAKEN FROM THE <4 OF NEPHI


Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi,
and also of the Lamanites—Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant
of the house of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile—Written by way of
commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of
revelation—Written and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they
might not be destroyed—To come forth by the gift and power of God unto
the interpretation thereof—Sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up
unto the <33 to come <27 in due time by way of the Gentile—The
<26 thereof by the gift of God.

An <115 taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a <123 of
the <124 of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded
the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to
heaven—Which is to show unto the <143 of the House of Israel what
great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may
know the covenants of the <100 that they are not cast off forever—And
also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST,
the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations—And now, if there
are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the
<67 of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of
Christ.

Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and <138 unto whom
this work shall come: That we, through the grace of God the Father, and
our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates <189 contain this record,
<5 is a <194 of the <193 of <317 and also of the <313
<153 brethren, and also of the <15 of <208 who came from the
<193 of <31 hath been spoken. And we also know that they have been
translated by the gift and <294 of God, for his voice hath declared it
unto us; wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true. And we
also testify that we have seen the engravings <52 are upon the
plates; and they have been shown unto us by the <49 of God, and not
of man. And we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God
came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we
beheld and saw the plates, and the <59 thereon; and we know that
it is by the <172 of God the <172 and our Lord <171 <171 that
we <31 and bear <165 that these <248 are <102 And it is
marvelous in our eyes. Nevertheless, the <130 of the Lord commanded us
that we should bear <27 of it; <280 to be obedient unto the
commandments of God, we bear testimony of <42 things. And we know
that if we are faithful in <63 we <252 rid our garments of the
blood of all men, and be <309 <309 <113 the <309 of
<22 and <22 dwell with him eternally in the heavens. And the
honor be to the <107 and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, <190 is

THE <101 BOOK OF <32 HIS <101 AND <101 (1 Nephi)


An account of Lehi and his wife Sariah and his four sons, being called,
(beginning at the eldest) Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. The Lord warns
Lehi to depart out of the land of Jerusalem, because he prophesieth
unto the people concerning their iniquity and they seek to destroy his
life. He taketh three days’ journey into the wilderness with his
family. Nephi <12 his brethren and returneth to the land of
Jerusalem after the <306 of the Jews. The <85 of <43
sufferings. They take the daughters of Ishmael to wife. They take <13
families and <75 into the wilderness. Their sufferings and
afflictions in the <8 The course of <19 travels. They come
to the large waters. Nephi’s <60 rebel against him. He confoundeth
them, and buildeth a ship. They call the name of the place Bountiful.
They cross the <27 waters into the promised land, and so forth. This
is according to the <83 of Nephi; or in other words, I, Nephi,
wrote this record.

1 <119 Chapter 1

1:1 I, <17 having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was
taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and <20 seen many
<106 in the <104 of my days, nevertheless, <12 been highly
favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, <13 had a great knowledge
of the goodness and the mysteries of God, <53 I make a <177 of
my proceedings in my days.

1:2 Yea, I make a <16 in the language of my father, <451 consists
of the <76 of the Jews and the <15 of the Egyptians.

1:3 And I know that the <31 <25 I make is true; and I make it with
mine own hand; and I make it <158 to my knowledge.

1:4 For it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of the
reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my <74 Lehi, <116 dwelt at
<282 in all his days); and in that same year there came many
prophets, prophesying unto the <335 that they must repent, or the
<143 city <28 must be destroyed.

1:5 Wherefore it came to pass that my <49 <49 as he went forth
prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his
people.

1:6 And it came to pass as he <27 unto the <27 <71 came a pillar
of fire and <92 upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard much;
and <426 of the things <161 he saw and <12 he did quake and
tremble exceedingly.

1:7 And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem;
and he cast himself upon his bed, <493 overcome with the Spirit and
the <47 <47 he had seen.

1:8 And <18 thus <19 with the Spirit, he was carried away in a
vision, even that he saw the heavens open, and he thought he saw God
sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of
angels in the attitude of singing and praising <449 God.

1:9 And it came to pass that he saw One descending out of the midst of
heaven, and he beheld that his luster was above that of the sun at
noon-day.

1:10 And he also saw twelve others following him, and <51 brightness
did exceed that of the stars in the firmament.

1:11 And they came down and went <234 upon the face of the earth; and
the <310 came and stood <203 my <255 and gave unto him a book,
and bade him that he should read.

1:12 And it came to pass that as he read, he was filled with the <182
of the Lord.

1:13 And he <17 saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for I have seen thine
abominations! Yea, and many <205 did my father read concerning
Jerusalem—that it <56 be destroyed, and the inhabitants thereof;
many <9 perish by the sword, and many <7 be <214 away
captive into Babylon.

1:14 And it came to pass that when my <42 had read and seen many
<384 and marvelous things, he did exclaim many <60 unto the Lord;
such as: Great and <15 are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! Thy
throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and goodness, and mercy
are over all the <83 of the earth, and, <357 thou art
merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come unto thee that they shall
perish!

1:15 And after this manner was the language of my <89 in the
<288 of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole heart was
filled, <52 of the <97 <362 he had seen, yea, <5 the Lord
had shown unto him.

1:16 And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the <30 <25
my <57 hath written, for he hath written many <12 <12 he saw in
visions and in dreams; and he also hath <16 many <16 <16 he
prophesied and spake unto his children, of <10 I <110 not make a
full account.

1:17 But I <13 make an <60 of my proceedings in my days. Behold,
I make an abridgment of the record of my <322 upon plates <39 I
have made with mine own hands; wherefore, <149 I have abridged the
<22 of my <93 then will I make an <46 of mine own life.

1:18 Therefore, I would that ye <279 know, that <32 the Lord had
<144 so many <246 <101 unto my <57 Lehi, yea, <317
the destruction of <338 behold he went <407 among the people,
and began to prophesy and to declare unto them <23 the <31
<84 he had both seen and heard.

1:19 And it came to pass that the Jews did mock him <217 of the
<28 <27 he testified of them; for he truly <6 of <484
wickedness and <4 abominations; and he <10 that the <22
<23 he saw and heard, and also the <10 <9 he read in the <467
manifested plainly of the coming of the Messiah, and also the
redemption of the world.

1:20 And when the Jews heard these <34 they were angry with him;
yea, even as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast out, and
stoned, and slain; and they also sought his life, that they might take
it away. But behold, I, <304 will show unto you that the tender
mercies of the Lord are over all <387 whom he hath chosen, <132 of
<116 faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.

1 Nephi Chapter 2

2:1 For <50 it came to pass that the Lord <317 unto my <222
yea, even in a dream, and said unto him: Blessed art thou <235 <53
of the <119 <153 thou hast done; and <10 thou hast been faithful
and declared unto this people the <18 <18 I commanded thee,
<54 they seek to take away thy <297

2:2 And it came to pass that the Lord <23 my <65 even in a
<64 that he <310 take his family and depart into the wilderness.

2:3 And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord,
wherefore he did as the Lord <45 him.

2:4 And it came to pass that he departed into the <43 And he
left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his
silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it
were his family, and provisions, and tents, and <43 into the
<44

2:5 And he came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea; and
he traveled in the wilderness in the <17 <159 are nearer the Red
Sea; and he did travel in the <17 with his <55 <17
consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, who were Laman,
Lemuel, and Sam.

2:6 And it came to pass that when he had <55 three days in the
wilderness, he pitched his tent in a valley by the side of a river of
water.

2:7 And it came to pass that he built an altar of stones, and made an
offering unto the <191 and gave thanks unto the Lord our God.

2:8 And it came to pass that he called the name of the river, <90
and it emptied into the Red Sea; and the <70 was in the <136 near
the mouth thereof.

2:9 And when my father saw that the waters of the <88 <32 into
the fountain of the Red Sea, he <366 unto <48 saying: O that thou
mightest be like unto this <60 continually running into the <24
of all righteousness!

2:10 And he also <30 unto Lemuel: O that thou <28 be like unto
this valley, firm and steadfast, and immovable in keeping the
commandments of the Lord!

2:11 Now this he <33 <402 of the stiffneckedness of Laman and
Lemuel; for behold they did murmur in many <406 against <480 <381
<21 he was a visionary man, and had led them out of the land of
Jerusalem, to leave the land of <25 <335 and <3 <335 and
<4 <335 and <3 <335 <335 to perish in the <319
And this they said he had done <48 of the foolish imaginations of
his heart.

2:12 And thus <79 and <284 being the eldest, did <78 <75
<41 father. And they did <8 <31 they knew not the dealings of
that God who had created them. 2:13 Neither did they believe that
<84 that great city, could be destroyed according to the words
of the prophets. And they were like unto the Jews who were at
<26 who sought to take away the life of my <62

2:14 And it came to pass that my <251 did speak unto them in the
<276 of <93 with power, <95 filled with the Spirit, until <94
frames did shake before him. And he did confound them, that they durst
not utter <114 him; wherefore, they did as he commanded <101

2:15 And my <52 dwelt in a tent.

2:16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, <56 exceedingly young,
nevertheless <5 large in stature, and also having <127 desires to
know of the mysteries of God, <52 I did cry unto the Lord; and
<259 he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did <164 all
the <155 <500 had been spoken by my father; <34 I did not
rebel <94 him like unto my brothers.

2:17 And I <313 unto Sam, making known unto him the <304 <34 the
Lord had manifested unto me by his Holy Spirit. And it came to pass
that he believed in my words.

2:18 But, behold, <267 and Lemuel would not hearken unto my words; and
<119 grieved <264 of the hardness of <181 hearts I cried unto the
Lord for <164

2:19 And it came to pass that the Lord <79 unto me, <455 Blessed
art thou, <162 <36 of thy faith, for thou hast <258 me
diligently, with lowliness of <337

2:20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye <5 prosper,
and <4 be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land <123 I have
prepared for you; yea, a land <10 is choice above all other lands.

2:21 And <46 as thy brethren <38 <172 <172 thee, they <5
be cut off from the presence of the Lord.

2:22 And <25 as thou shalt keep my <71 thou <5 be
made a ruler and a teacher over thy brethren.

2:23 For <166 in that day that they <47 <52 <52 me, I will
curse them even with a sore curse, and they <16 have no power over
thy seed except they <10 <26 <26 me also.

2:24 And if it so be that they <15 <15 me, they <20 be a
scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in the ways of remembrance.

1 Nephi Chapter 3

3:1 And it came to pass that I, <204 returned from speaking with the
Lord, to the tent of my <459

3:2 And it came to pass that he <237 unto me, <237 Behold I have
dreamed a dream, in the <187 the Lord hath <432 me that thou and
thy <183 <85 return to Jerusalem.

3:3 For <146 Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a genealogy
of my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of brass.

3:4 Wherefore, the Lord hath <49 me that thou and thy brothers
should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring them
down hither into the wilderness.

3:5 And now, <459 thy <30 murmur, saying it is a hard thing
<98 I have required of them; but <18 I have not <8 it of
them, but it is a commandment of the <277

3:6 Therefore go, my son, and thou <274 be favored of the <168
<380 thou hast not murmured.

3:7 And it came to pass that I, <193 said unto my father: I will go
and do the <488 <70 the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the
Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he <178
prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the <106 <35 he
commandeth <470

3:8 And it came to pass that when my father had heard these words he
was exceedingly glad, for he knew that I had been blessed of the <119

3:9 And I, <92 and my <239 took our journey in the wilderness,
with our tents, to go up to the land of <253

3:10 And it came to pass that when we had gone up to the land of
Jerusalem, I and my <43 did consult one with another.

3:11 And we cast lots—who of us <248 go in unto the <249 of Laban.
And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and Laman went in
unto the <22 of <271 and he talked with him as he sat in his house.

3:12 And he desired of <336 the records <158 were <323 upon the
<325 of brass, <9 contained the <341 of my <401

3:13 And <361 it came to pass that <30 was angry, and thrust him
out from his presence; and he would not that he <96 have the
records. <361 he said unto him: <424 thou art a robber, and I
will slay thee.

3:14 But <101 fled out of his presence, and told the <273 <71
<55 had done, unto us. And we began to be <225 sorrowful, and
my <165 were about to <449 unto my <245 in the <388

3:15 But <369 I said unto them that: As the Lord liveth, and as we
live, we will not go down unto our <31 in the wilderness until we
have accomplished the <304 <66 the Lord hath <458 us.

3:16 <107 let us be faithful in keeping the <343 of the
Lord; therefore let us go down to the land of our father’s inheritance,
for <70 he left gold and silver, and all manner of riches. And all
this he hath done <423 of the <40 of the <328

3:17 For he knew that Jerusalem must be destroyed, <19 of the
wickedness of the people.

3:18 For <212 they have rejected the <375 of the prophets.
<87 if my <111 <203 dwell in the land after he hath been
<107 to flee out of the land, <31 he <226 also perish.
<27 it must needs be that he flee out of the land.

3:19 And <23 it is wisdom in God that we <48 obtain <435
records, that we may preserve unto our <482 the language of our
fathers;

3:20 And also that we may <19 unto them the <88 <181 have been
spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets, <13 have been delivered
unto them by the Spirit and power of God, since the world began, even
down unto this present time.

3:21 And it came to pass that <123 this <186 of <71 did I
persuade my brethren, that they might be <230 in <230 the
<191 of God.

3:22 And it came to pass that we went down to the land of our
<237 and we did gather together our gold, and our <239 and
our precious things.

3:23 And <63 we had gathered <145 <364 together, we went up again
unto the <477 of <499

3:24 And it came to pass that we went in unto <492 and <476 him
that he <210 give unto us the <482 <142 were <482 upon the
<482 of <482 for <10 we <18 give unto him our <75 and our
<76 and all our <76 <76

3:25 And it came to pass that when <438 saw our property, and that it
was <437 great, he did lust <96 it, insomuch that he <508 us
out, and sent his servants to slay us, that he <164 <257 our
property.

3:26 And it came to pass that we did flee before the <26 of <105
and we were obliged to leave behind our <61 and it fell into the
hands of <139

3:27 And it came to pass that we fled into the wilderness, and the
<40 of <94 did not overtake us, and we hid ourselves in the
cavity of a rock.

3:28 And it came to pass that Laman was angry with me, and also with my
father; and also was Lemuel, for he hearkened unto the <334 of Laman.
Wherefore <25 and Lemuel did speak many hard <12 unto us, their
younger brothers, and they did smite us even with a rod.

3:29 And it came to pass as they smote us with a rod, <417 an angel
of the Lord came and stood <144 them, and he spake unto <5 saying:
Why do ye <44 your <51 brother with a rod? Know ye not that the
Lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you, and this because of your
iniquities? Behold ye shall go up to Jerusalem again, and the Lord will
deliver <156 into your hands.

3:30 And <245 the <75 had <452 unto us, he departed.

3:31 And <14 the <14 had departed, <133 and <133 <353 began to
murmur, <85 How is it possible that the Lord will <46 <46
into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty,
yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?

1 Nephi Chapter 4

4:1 And it came to pass that I <143 unto my <479 <59 Let us
go up <70 unto Jerusalem, and let us be <488 in <488 the
<488 of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth,
then why not <9 than <86 and his <74 yea, or even than his
tens of thousands?

4:2 Therefore let us go up; let us be strong like unto Moses; for he
truly <74 unto the waters of the Red Sea and they divided hither and
thither, and our fathers came through, out of captivity, on dry ground,
and the armies of Pharaoh did follow and were drowned in the <36 of
the Red Sea.

4:3 Now <97 ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an
<204 hath <218 unto you; wherefore can ye doubt? Let us go up; the
Lord is able to <203 us, even as our fathers, and to destroy <453
even as the Egyptians.

4:4 Now when I had <40 these words, they were yet wroth, and did
still continue to murmur; nevertheless they did <90 me up until we
came without the walls of Jerusalem.

4:5 And it was by night; and I caused that they should hide themselves
<23 the walls. And <299 they had hid themselves, I, Nephi, crept
into the city and went forth towards the house of Laban.

4:6 And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things
which I <47 do.

4:7 Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near unto the <39 of
<249 I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth <449 me, for he
was drunken with wine.

4:8 And when I came to him I found that it was <76

4:9 And I <41 his sword, and I drew it <95 from the sheath
thereof; and the hilt thereof was of pure gold, and the workmanship
<9 was exceedingly fine, and I saw that the blade <10 was of
the most precious steel.

4:10 And it came to pass that I was constrained by the Spirit that I
<125 kill Laban; but I said in my heart: Never at any time have I
shed the blood of man. And I shrunk and would that I might not slay
him.

4:11 And the <43 said unto me again: Behold the Lord hath delivered
him into thy hands. Yea, and I also knew that he had sought to take
away mine own life; yea, and he <48 not hearken unto the <451
of the <452 and he also had taken away our property.

4:12 And it came to pass that the <63 said unto me <63 Slay him,
for the Lord hath <66 him into thy hands;

4:13 <79 the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring <186 his righteous
purposes. It is better that one man <142 perish than that a nation
<7 dwindle and <9 in unbelief.

4:14 And now, when I, <321 had heard <380 <380 I remembered the
words of the Lord <303 he <499 unto me in the wilderness, saying
that: Inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my commandments, they <5
prosper in the land of promise.

4:15 Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the <141
of the Lord according to the law of Moses, save they <83 have the
law.

4:16 And I also knew that the law was engraven upon the plates of
brass.

4:17 And again, I knew that the Lord had <154 <374 into my hands
for this cause—that I <250 obtain the records <58 to his
commandments.

4:18 Therefore I did obey the voice of the <433 and took <33 by
the hair of the head, and I smote off his head with his own sword.

4:19 And <489 I had smitten off his head with his own <395 I took
the garments of <40 and put them upon mine own body; yea, even every
whit; and I did gird on his armor about my loins.

4:20 And <45 I had done this, I went <246 unto the treasury of
<452 And as I went <11 towards the <11 of Laban, behold, I saw
the servant of <59 who had the keys of the treasury. And I commanded
him in the <120 of <25 that he <189 go with me into the <19

4:21 And he supposed me to be his master, <22 for he <505 the
<106 and also the sword girded <90 my <90

4:22 And he <283 unto me concerning the elders of the Jews, he knowing
that his <36 <36 had been out by night among them.

4:23 And I <29 unto him as if it had been <115

4:24 And I also <16 unto him that I <90 carry the engravings,
<340 were upon the <268 of brass, to my elder brethren, who were
without the walls.

4:25 And I also bade him that he <33 follow me.

4:26 And he, supposing that I <50 of the brethren of the church, and
that I was truly that <169 whom I had slain, wherefore he did <33
me.

4:27 And he <31 unto me many times <128 the <128 of the <128
as I went <214 unto my <79 who were <78 the <78

4:28 And it came to pass that when Laman saw me he was exceedingly
frightened, and also Lemuel and Sam. And they fled from before my
presence; for they <211 it was <172 and that he had slain me and
had sought to take away their lives also.

4:29 And it came to pass that I called <307 them, and they did hear
me; <110 they did cease to flee from my presence.

4:30 And it came to pass that when the <307 of <138 <266 my
<153 he began to tremble, and was <267 to flee from <84 me and
return to the city of Jerusalem.

4:31 And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also having
received much strength of the Lord, therefore I did seize upon the
<58 of <118 and held him, that he <228 not flee.

4:32 And it came to pass that I <199 with him, that if he would
hearken unto my words, as the Lord liveth, and as I live, even so that
if he <20 <19 unto our <19 we <6 spare his life.

4:33 And I <42 unto him, even with an oath, that he need not fear;
that he <71 be a free man like unto us if he <35 go down in the
wilderness with us.

4:34 And I also <41 unto him, saying: Surely the Lord hath <466
us to do this thing; and shall we not be diligent in keeping the
commandments of the Lord? Therefore, if thou wilt go down into the
<48 to my father thou shalt have place with us.

4:35 And it came to pass that Zoram did take courage at the words <418
I spake. Now <12 was the name of the servant; and he promised that he
<99 go down into the <50 unto our father. Yea, and he also
made an oath unto us that he <21 tarry with us from that time forth.

4:36 Now we were desirous that he <148 <18 with us for this cause,
that the Jews might not know <413 our flight into the wilderness,
lest they <23 pursue us and destroy us.

4:37 And it came to pass that when <92 had made an oath unto us, our
fears did <354 <38 him.

4:38 And it came to pass that we took the plates of brass and the
<300 of <300 and departed into the <61 and journeyed unto
the tent of our <120

1 Nephi Chapter 5

5:1 And it came to pass that <421 we had come down into the <148
unto our father, behold, he was filled with joy, and also my mother,
Sariah, was <496 glad, for she truly had mourned because of us.

5:2 For she had <495 that we had perished in the wilderness; and
she also had complained against my <47 telling him that he was a
visionary man; <294 Behold thou hast led us forth from the land of
our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we perish in the
wilderness.

5:3 And <100 this manner of language had my mother <53 <53
my <130

5:4 And it had come to pass that my <313 <355 unto her, <61 I
know that I am a <71 man; for if I had not seen the things of God
in a vision I <238 not have known the goodness of God, but had
tarried at Jerusalem, and had <124 with my brethren.

5:5 But <167 I have obtained a land of promise, in the <353 <44
I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of
the hands of <244 and bring them down again unto us in the
<129

5:6 And <129 this <129 of <129 did my <178 Lehi, comfort my
<220 <219 <298 us, while we <272 in the <243 up
to the land of <90 to obtain the record of the Jews.

5:7 And when we had returned to the tent of my <43 behold their joy
was full, and my <181 was comforted.

5:8 And she spake, <169 Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath
commanded my husband to flee into the <268 yea, and I also know
of a <22 that the Lord hath protected my sons, and delivered them
out of the <131 of <131 and given them power whereby they could
accomplish the thing <166 the Lord hath <49 them. And <133 this
<134 of <134 did she speak.

5:9 And it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and did
offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord; and they gave thanks
unto the God of Israel.

5:10 And <49 they had <69 <16 unto the God of Israel, my <143
<187 took the records <73 were engraven upon the <473 of brass,
and he did search them from the beginning.

5:11 And he beheld that they did contain the five books of Moses, <33
gave an account of the creation of the world, and also of Adam and Eve,
who were our first parents;

5:12 And also a <230 of the Jews from the beginning, even down to the
commencement of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah;

5:13 And also the prophecies of the holy prophets, from the <29
even down to the <29 of the <29 of Zedekiah; and also many
<23 <82 have been spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah.

5:14 And it came to pass that my <141 <140 also found upon the
<137 of brass a genealogy of his fathers; wherefore he knew that he
was a descendant of Joseph; yea, even that Joseph who was the son of
Jacob, who was sold into Egypt, and who was preserved by the hand of
the Lord, that he might preserve his <58 <23 and all his
household from perishing with famine.

5:15 And they were also led out of captivity and out of the land of
<47 by that same God who had <50 <299

5:16 And thus my <46 <104 did discover the <98 of his
fathers. And Laban also was a <96 of Joseph, <107 he and
his fathers had kept the records.

5:17 And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled with
the Spirit, and began to prophesy <476 his seed—

5:18 That <21 <158 of <158 should go forth unto all nations,
kindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed.

5:19 Wherefore, he said that <28 <28 of <28 <28 never perish;
neither <5 they be dimmed any more by time. And he prophesied many
things <59 his <34

5:20 And it came to pass that thus far I and my <93 had kept the
commandments wherewith the Lord had <447 us.

5:21 And we had obtained the <390 <275 the Lord had <16 us,
and searched them and <263 that they were desirable; yea, even of
great worth unto us, insomuch that we <495 <227 the <47
of the Lord unto our children.

5:22 <109 it was wisdom in the Lord that we <105 carry them
with us, as we journeyed in the wilderness towards the land of promise.

1 Nephi Chapter 6

6:1 And now I, Nephi, do not give the <233 of my <218 in this
part of my record; <153 at any time shall I give it after upon <171
<172 <111 I am writing; for it is given in the <448 <11 has been
kept by my father; wherefore, I do not write it in this work.

6:2 For it sufficeth me to say that we are descendants of Joseph.

6:3 And it mattereth not to me that I am particular to give a full
account of all the <219 of my <332 for they cannot be written upon
<81 plates, for I desire the room that I may <65 of the <24 of
God.

6:4 For the fulness of mine intent is that I may persuade men to come
unto the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of <435
and be saved.

6:5 <206 the <48 <129 are pleasing unto the world I do not
write, but the <14 <14 are <14 unto God and unto those who
are not of the world.

6:6 <36 I <184 give commandment unto my seed, that they <8
not occupy <109 <189 with <37 <37 are not of <285 unto the
children of men.

1 <245 <245 7

7:1 And now I would that ye might know, that <227 my <154 <486 had
made an end of prophesying <384 his <55 it came to pass that
the Lord spake unto him again, saying that it was not meet for him,
<32 that he <320 take his family into the <315 alone; but
that his sons <13 take daughters to wife, that they <61 raise up
seed unto the Lord in the land of <336

7:2 And it came to pass that the Lord <412 him that I, <338 and
my brethren, <41 again return unto the land of Jerusalem, and bring
down Ishmael and his <66 into the wilderness.

7:3 And it came to pass that I, <35 did <99 with my <36 go
forth into the <89 to go up to Jerusalem.

7:4 And it came to pass that we went up unto the house of Ishmael, and
we did gain favor in the sight of <11 <477 that we did speak
unto him the words of the Lord.

7:5 And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the heart of <31
and also his household, <36 that they took their journey with us
down into the <83 to the tent of our father.

7:6 And it came to pass that as we <509 in the wilderness, behold
Laman and Lemuel, and two of the <195 of <52 and the two sons
of <153 and <51 families, did rebel against us; yea, <3 me,
<147 and Sam, and <14 <272 <25 and his <223 and his three
other daughters.

7:7 And it came to pass in the <327 rebellion, they were desirous to
<209 unto the land of <170

7:8 And now I, <47 being grieved for the hardness of <50 hearts,
therefore I <306 unto them, saying, yea, even unto <94 and unto
Lemuel: Behold ye are mine elder <218 and how is it that ye are so
hard in your <34 and so blind in your minds, that ye have need that
I, your younger brother, <283 <204 unto you, yea, and set an example
for you?

7:9 How is it that ye have not hearkened unto the word of the Lord?

7:10 How is it that ye have forgotten that ye have seen an angel of the
<21

7:11 Yea, and how is it that ye have <23 what great <473 the
Lord hath done for us, in delivering us out of the hands of Laban, and
also that we <88 obtain the record?

7:12 Yea, and how is it that ye have <41 that the Lord is able to
do all <48 according to his will, for the children of men, if it so
be that they exercise faith in him? Wherefore, let us be faithful to
him.

7:13 And if it so be that we are <16 to him, we shall <71 the
land of promise; and ye <9 know at some future period that the word
of the Lord <13 be fulfilled concerning the destruction of Jerusalem;
for all <78 <272 the Lord hath spoken <14 the <14 of
Jerusalem must be fulfilled.

7:14 For behold, the Spirit of the Lord ceaseth soon to strive with
them; for <14 they have rejected the prophets, and Jeremiah have
they cast into prison. And they have sought to take away the life of my
<353 <424 that they have driven him out of the land.

7:15 Now <42 I say unto you that if ye will <349 unto <76
ye <101 also perish with them. And now, if ye have choice, go up to
the land, and remember the <500 <110 I <304 unto you, that if ye go
ye will also perish; for thus the <106 of the Lord constraineth me
that I <241 speak.

7:16 And it came to pass that when I, <402 had <148 these <45
unto my <381 they were angry with me. And it came to pass that
they did lay <419 <288 upon me, for <104 they were exceedingly
wroth, and they did bind me with cords, for they <144 to take away my
life, that they might leave me in the wilderness to be devoured by wild
beasts.

7:17 But it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord, saying: O <3
<313 to my <299 <129 is in thee, wilt thou deliver me from the
<75 of my brethren; yea, even give me strength that I may burst <110
bands with <28 I am bound.

7:18 And it came to pass that when I had said <22 words, <108 the
<25 were loosed from off my <46 and feet, and I stood before my
<147 and I spake unto them again.

7:19 And it came to pass that they were <163 with me again, and <135
to lay <37 upon me; but <50 one of the daughters of Ishmael, yea,
and also her mother, and one of the sons of <13 did plead with my
<57 <303 that they did soften <194 hearts; and they did
cease striving to take away my life.

7:20 And it came to pass that they were sorrowful, because of <28
wickedness, <36 that they did bow down <103 me, and did <51
with me that I would forgive them of the thing that they had done
against me.

7:21 And it came to pass that I did frankly <25 them all that they
had done, and I did exhort them that they <41 pray unto the Lord
<66 God for forgiveness. And it came to pass that they did so. And
after they had done praying unto the Lord we did again travel on our
journey towards the tent of our father.

7:22 And it came to pass that we did come down unto the tent of our
<21 And <44 I and my brethren and all the house of Ishmael had
come down unto the tent of my <482 they did give thanks unto the
Lord <88 God; and they did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto
him.

1 Nephi Chapter 8

8:1 And it came to pass that we had gathered together all manner of
seeds of every kind, both of grain of <6 <6 and also of the <14
of fruit of <11 kind.

8:2 And it came to pass that while my father tarried in the <417
he <320 unto us, <400 Behold, I have dreamed a dream; or, in other
<356 I have seen a vision.

8:3 And <316 <260 of the <237 <391 I have seen, I have reason
to rejoice in the Lord <17 of <106 and also of Sam; for I have
<18 to suppose that they, and also many of <141 seed, will be
saved.

8:4 But <49 Laman and Lemuel, I fear exceedingly <38 of you;
for <12 methought I saw in my dream, a dark and dreary wilderness.

8:5 And it came to pass that I saw a man, and he was dressed in a white
robe; and he came and <452 <349 me.

8:6 And it came to pass that he <139 unto me, and bade me follow him.

8:7 And it came to pass that as I followed him I beheld myself that I
was in a dark and <76 waste.

8:8 And <286 I had traveled for the space of many hours in darkness, I
began to pray unto the Lord that he <373 have mercy on me, according
to the multitude of his tender mercies.

8:9 And it came to pass <45 I had prayed unto the Lord I <70 a
large and spacious field.

8:10 And it came to pass that I <18 a tree, whose <277 was
desirable to make one happy.

8:11 And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the <26
thereof; and I <35 that it was most sweet, above all that I ever
<171 tasted. Yea, and I <17 that the <25 thereof was white, to
exceed all the whiteness that I had ever seen.

8:12 And as I partook of the <25 <25 it filled my soul with
<258 great joy; wherefore, I <150 to be desirous that my family
should <75 of it also; for I knew that it was <105 <72 all
<354 fruit.

8:13 And as I cast my eyes round about, that perhaps I might discover
my <38 also, I <88 a river of water; and it ran along, and it was
near the tree of <377 I was partaking the <45

8:14 And I looked to behold from whence it came; and I saw the head
<101 a little way off; and at the head <9 I <53 your mother
Sariah, and Sam, and Nephi; and they <329 as if they knew not whither
they <112 go.

8:15 And it came to pass that I beckoned unto them; and I also did say
unto them with a loud voice that they <30 come unto me, and <146
of the fruit, <96 was <143 <143 all <142 <97

8:16 And it came to pass that they did come unto me and <28 of the
<200 also.

8:17 And it came to pass that I was <198 that <471 and Lemuel
<57 come and <27 of the <26 <202 <217 I cast mine eyes
towards the head of the river, that <190 I <190 see them.

8:18 And it came to pass that I saw them, but they <390 not come unto
me and <45 of the <92

8:19 And I <165 a rod of iron, and it extended along the bank of the
<53 and led to the tree by <126 I stood.

8:20 And I also <31 a strait and narrow path, <16 came <31 by
the rod of <41 even to the tree by <14 I stood; and it also led by
the head of the fountain, unto a <440 and <440 field, as if it had
been a world.

8:21 And I saw numberless concourses of people, many of whom were
pressing forward, that they <134 obtain the path <52 led unto the
tree by <7 I <89

8:22 And it came to pass that they did come forth, and commence in the
path <23 led to the tree.

8:23 And it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness; yea, even
an <428 <428 mist of darkness, insomuch that they who had
commenced in the path did lose their way, that they wandered off and
were lost.

8:24 And it came to pass that I <165 others <103 <103 and
they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they
did press forward through the mist of <64 clinging to the rod of
<188 even until they did come <35 and <251 of the <296 of the
<111

8:25 And after they had partaken of the <16 of the tree they did cast
<93 eyes about as if they were ashamed.

8:26 And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the <392 side
of the river of water, a <142 and <234 building; and it <461 as
it were in the air, high <418 the earth.

8:27 And it was filled with <239 both old and young, both male and
female; and <71 manner of dress was <186 fine; and they were
in the attitude of mocking and pointing <18 fingers <403 those who
had come at and were partaking of the <378

8:28 And <123 they had tasted of the <123 they were ashamed, because
of <30 that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden
paths and were <222

8:29 And now I, Nephi, do not speak all the words of my father.

8:30 But, to be short in writing, behold, he saw <145 multitudes
<242 forward; and they came and <240 hold of the end of the rod
of <241 and they did <240 <104 way <264 continually holding fast
to the rod of <239 <238 they came <237 and fell down and partook of
the <102 of the <240

8:31 And he also saw <60 <60 feeling <39 way <143 that
<204 and <204 building.

8:32 And it came to pass that many were drowned in the depths of the
fountain; and many were lost from his view, wandering in strange roads.

8:33 And <40 was the multitude that did enter into that <16
<48 And <181 they did <10 into that building they did point
the finger of scorn at me and <186 that were <211 of the <97
also; but we heeded them not.

8:34 These are the <177 of my father: For as many as <18 them, had
fallen away.

8:35 And Laman and Lemuel <138 not of the fruit, said my <203

8:36 And it came to pass <78 my father had spoken all the <46 of
his dream or vision, which were many, he said unto us, <270 of these
things <12 he saw in a <18 he <325 feared for <56 and
Lemuel; yea, he <8 lest they should be cast off from the presence
of the Lord.

8:37 And he did exhort them then with all the <206 of a tender
parent, that they would hearken to his words, that perhaps the Lord
<10 be merciful to <121 and not cast them off; yea, my <97 did
preach unto them.

8:38 And <110 he had preached unto <24 and also prophesied unto them
of many things, he bade them to keep the commandments of the Lord; and
he did cease speaking unto <38

1 Nephi Chapter 9

9:1 And all <133 <132 did my <61 see, and hear, and speak, as he
dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel, and also a <272 many more
<61 <160 cannot be written upon <35 plates.

9:2 And now, as I have <198 concerning <13 plates, behold they are
not the plates upon <28 I make a full account of the history of my
people; for the <17 upon <17 I make a full <17 of my people I
have given the name of Nephi; wherefore, they are called the <24 of
<478 <147 mine own name; and <58 <10 also are <15 the <5
of Nephi.

9:3 Nevertheless, I have received a commandment of the Lord that I
<243 make <28 <86 for the special purpose that there <10 be
an <66 engraven of the ministry of my people.

9:4 Upon the <455 <49 <20 be <17 an <20 of the reign of
the kings, and the wars and contentions of my <111 wherefore <49
<24 are for the more part of the ministry; and the <36 <12 are
for the more part of the <37 of the kings and the wars and
<37 of my <65

9:5 Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me to make <48 <35 for a
wise <98 in him, <165 <4 I know not.

9:6 But the Lord knoweth all <253 from the beginning; <166 he
prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men;
for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words. And
thus it is. Amen.

1 <307 <307 10

10:1 And now I, <208 proceed to give an <147 upon <84 <84 of
my proceedings, and my <117 and <132 <68 to <19 with
mine account, I must speak somewhat of the <85 of my father, and
also of my brethren.

10:2 For <78 it came to pass <258 my <357 had made an end of
<384 the words of his dream, and also of exhorting them to all
diligence, he spake unto them <340 the Jews—

10:3 That <36 they <235 be destroyed, even that <377 city
Jerusalem, and many be carried away captive into Babylon, according to
the own due time of the Lord, they <28 return again, yea, even be
brought back out of captivity; and <43 they <15 be <10 back
out of captivity they <9 possess again the land of their
inheritance.

10:4 Yea, even six hundred years from the time that my <111 left
<70 a prophet would the Lord God raise up <215 the Jews—even a
Messiah, or, in <296 words, a Savior of the world.

10:5 And he also <122 <120 the prophets, how <109 a number had
testified of <203 <490 <13 this <33 of whom he had
spoken, or this Redeemer of the <36

10:6 <316 all mankind were in a lost and in a fallen state, and
ever <76 be save they <109 rely on this Redeemer.

10:7 And he <63 also <51 a <96 who <17 come before the
<58 to prepare the way of the Lord—

10:8 Yea, even he <20 go forth and cry in the wilderness: Prepare ye
the way of the <187 and make his paths straight; for <476 standeth
one <137 you whom ye know not; and he is mightier than I, whose shoe’s
latchet I am not worthy to unloose. And much <76 my <175 <77
this thing.

10:9 And my <11 said he <66 baptize in Bethabara, beyond Jordan;
and he also said he <12 <12 with water; even that he <7
<8 the Messiah with water.

10:10 And <254 he had baptized the <13 with water, he <21
behold and bear record that he had <15 the Lamb of God, who <15
take away the sins of the <190

10:11 And it came to pass <42 my <78 had spoken <221 <370 he
<98 unto my brethren <99 the gospel <510 <35 be preached
<134 the Jews, and also <13 the dwindling of the Jews in
unbelief. And <36 they had slain the <195 who <26 come, and
<11 he had been <12 he <10 rise from the dead, and <6 make
himself manifest, by the Holy Ghost, unto the Gentiles.

10:12 Yea, even my <76 <70 much <55 the Gentiles, and also
<6 the house of Israel, that they <35 be compared like unto
an olive-tree, <203 branches <10 be broken off and <5 be
scattered upon all the face of the earth.

10:13 <319 he said it must needs be that we <24 be led with
one accord into the land of promise, unto the fulfilling of the word of
the <278 that we <24 be <47 upon all the face of the <47

10:14 And <125 the <85 of Israel <20 be <20 they <4 be
gathered together again; or, in fine, <18 the Gentiles had received
the fulness of the Gospel, the natural <100 of the <105 or
the remnants of the <39 of <124 <35 be grafted in, or come to
the knowledge of the true <188 <509 Lord and <3 <406

10:15 And <50 this manner of language did my <169 prophesy and
speak unto my brethren, and also many more things <244 I do not write
in this book; for I have written as many of them as were expedient for
me in mine other book.

10:16 And all <288 <509 of <36 I have <505 were done as my
<58 dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel.

10:17 And it came to pass <84 I, Nephi, having heard all the <325 of
my father, <249 the <79 <43 he saw in a vision, and also the
<11 <11 he <273 by the power of the Holy <292 <10 <6 he
<170 by faith on the Son of God—and the Son of God was the <415
who <165 come—I, <57 was desirous also that I might see, and hear,
and know of <104 <104 by the <40 of the Holy <46 <46 is the
gift of God unto all those who diligently seek him, as well in times of
old as in the time that he <52 manifest <373 unto the children of
men.

10:18 For he is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever; and the way is
prepared for all men from the foundation of the world, if it so be that
they repent and come unto him.

10:19 For he that <72 seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of
God <8 be unfolded unto them, by the <105 of the Holy <105 as
well in <118 <93 as in <3 of old, and as well in <7 of old as
in <6 to come; wherefore, the course of the Lord is one eternal
round.

10:20 Therefore remember, O man, for all thy doings thou shalt be
brought into judgment.

10:21 <445 if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of your
probation, then ye are found unclean before the judgment-seat of God;
and no <9 thing can dwell with God; <68 ye must be cast off
forever.

10:22 And the Holy Ghost giveth authority that I <190 <373 <110
<229 and deny them not.

1 Nephi Chapter 11

11:1 For it came to pass <324 I had desired to know the <306 that my
<354 had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them
known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught away in
the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly high mountain, <294 I
never had <116 <45 and upon <9 I <8 had <8 set my foot.

11:2 And the <33 said unto me: Behold, what desirest thou?

11:3 And I said: I desire to behold the <88 <35 my <87 saw.

11:4 And the <31 said unto me: Believest thou that thy <16 saw
the tree of <24 he hath spoken?

11:5 And I <41 Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the <456 of my
father.

11:6 And when I had spoken <176 words, the <50 cried with a loud
voice, saying: Hosanna to the <122 the most high God; for he is God
over all the earth, yea, even above all. And blessed art thou, <454
because thou believest in the Son of the most high God; <247 thou
<294 <113 the <113 <89 thou hast desired.

11:7 And <12 this <270 <370 be given unto thee for a sign, that
<231 thou hast beheld the tree <28 bore the fruit <4 thy <129
tasted, thou <42 also <31 a man descending out of heaven, and him
<38 ye witness; and <32 ye have witnessed him ye <10 bear record
that it is the Son of God.

11:8 And it came to pass that the <135 said unto me: Look! And I
looked and <67 a tree; and it was like unto the tree <70 my <70
had seen; and the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea, exceeding of all
beauty; and the whiteness <13 did exceed the <5 of the
driven snow.

11:9 And it came to pass <89 I had seen the tree, I said unto the
Spirit: I <116 thou hast shown unto me the tree <62 is precious
<194 all.

11:10 And he said unto me: What <308 <308

11:11 And I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereof—for I
spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I <115 that he was in the form
of a man; yet nevertheless, I knew that it was the <144 of the Lord;
and he <35 unto me as a man speaketh with another.

11:12 And it came to pass that he said unto me: <170 And I <169 as
if to look upon him, and I saw him not; for he had gone from <421 my
presence.

11:13 And it came to pass that I <33 and <87 the great city of
Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I <13 the city of Nazareth;
and in the city of Nazareth I <13 a virgin, and she was <486
fair and white.

11:14 And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel
came down and stood <77 me; and he said unto me: <381 what
beholdest <184

11:15 And I said unto him: A <54 most beautiful and fair <213 all
<81 virgins.

11:16 And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?

11:17 And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children;
<199 I do not know the meaning of all things.

11:18 And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the
mother of the Son of God, <309 the manner of the flesh.

11:19 And it came to pass that I <149 that she was carried away in
the Spirit; and <28 she had been <11 away in the <262 for the
space of a time the <149 <265 unto me, saying: <246

11:20 And I <217 and <42 the <74 again, bearing a child in her
arms.

11:21 And the <31 said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the
Son of the Eternal Father! <151 thou the <125 of the tree <389
thy <452 saw?

11:22 And I answered him, <65 Yea, it is the love of God, <21
sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore,
it is the most desirable <213 all <169

11:23 And he <105 unto me, <40 Yea, and the most joyous to the
soul.

11:24 And <141 he had said these words, he said unto me: <129 And I
looked, and I <127 the Son of God going forth among the <63 of
men; and I saw many fall down at his feet and worship him.

11:25 And it came to pass that I <36 that the rod of iron, <106 my
<127 had seen, was the word of God, <11 led to the fountain of
living waters, or to the tree of life; <15 waters are a
representation of the love of God; and I also <46 that the tree of
life was a <18 of the love of God.

11:26 And the <213 said unto me again: Look and behold the
<353 of God!

11:27 And I <251 and <42 the Redeemer of the world, of whom my
<89 had spoken; and I also <16 the prophet who should prepare the
way <433 him. And the Lamb of God went <151 and was baptized of him;
and <182 he was baptized, I <30 the <466 open, and the Holy
Ghost come down out of heaven and abide upon him in the form of a dove.

11:28 And I <30 that he went <47 ministering unto the people, in
power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together to
hear him; and I <27 that they cast him out from <227 them.

11:29 And I also <16 twelve others following him. And it came to
pass that they were <411 away in the <411 from <114 my face, and
I saw them not.

11:30 And it came to pass that the <180 <319 unto me <411 <320
<297 And I <296 and I <53 the <126 open <13 and I saw
angels descending upon the <300 of men; and they did minister unto
<83

11:31 And he <41 unto me <28 <41 <40 And I <40 and I
<41 the Lamb of God <337 <139 <110 the <37 of men. And I
<15 <136 of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with
all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits; and the
<95 <54 and showed all <396 things unto me. And they were healed
by the <183 of the Lamb of God; and the <31 and the <32 spirits
were cast out.

11:32 And it came to pass that the <44 <44 unto me <98 <98
<99 And I <310 and <82 the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the
people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the world;
and I saw and bear record.

11:33 And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain
for the sins of the world.

11:34 And <331 he was <16 I saw the <150 of the earth, that
they were <292 <292 to fight against the apostles of the Lamb;
for thus were the <282 called by the <108 of the Lord.

11:35 And the multitude of the earth was <34 together; and I
<116 that they were in a large and spacious building, like unto the
building <497 my <433 saw. And the <41 of the Lord <152 unto me
<153 <153 Behold the world and the wisdom thereof; yea, <479 the
house of Israel hath <51 <85 to <85 <85 the <76
<87 of the Lamb.

11:36 And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the <412
and <70 <65 was the pride of the <177 and it fell, and the
fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the <78 of the Lord <78
unto me <78 <78 Thus shall be the destruction of all nations,
kindreds, tongues, and <463 that <13 <75 <75 the <75
<75 of the <75

1 Nephi Chapter 12

12:1 And it came to pass that the <52 said unto me: Look, and <118
thy seed, and also the seed of thy brethren. And I <288 and <172
the land of promise; and I <8 <228 of <62 yea, even as it
were in number as many as the sand of the sea.

12:2 And it came to pass that I <31 <31 <167 <167 to
battle, one <94 the other; and I <13 wars, and rumors of <4
and <157 slaughters with the sword <443 my people.

12:3 And it came to pass that I <27 many generations pass away,
<311 the <443 of wars and contentions in the land; and I <18 many
cities, yea, even that I did not <88 <512

12:4 And it came to pass that I saw a mist of darkness on the face of
the land of <128 and I saw lightnings, and I heard thunderings, and
earthquakes, and all <60 of tumultuous noises; and I saw the <334
and the rocks, that they rent; and I saw mountains tumbling into
pieces; and I saw the plains of the <394 that they were broken up;
and I saw many cities that they were sunk; and I saw many that they
were burned with fire; and I saw many that did tumble to the <36
because of the quaking thereof.

12:5 And it came to pass <145 I saw these things, I saw the vapor of
darkness, that it passed from off the face of the earth; and behold, I
saw <217 who had not fallen <46 of the <205 and terrible
judgments of the <461

12:6 And I saw the heavens open, and the Lamb of God descending out of
heaven; and he came down and showed himself unto <193

12:7 And I also saw and bear record that the Holy Ghost fell upon
<365 others; and they were ordained of God, and chosen.

12:8 And the <357 <406 unto me, <404 <482 the <23 disciples
of the Lamb, who are chosen to minister unto thy seed.

12:9 And he said unto me: Thou rememberest the <26 <413 of the
Lamb? <34 they are they who <429 judge the <14 tribes of Israel;
wherefore, the <7 ministers of thy seed <15 be judged of them;
for ye are of the house of Israel.

12:10 And <181 <25 <25 whom thou beholdest <25 <40 thy
<68 And, <173 they are righteous forever; for <170 of their
faith in the Lamb of God <8 garments are made white in his blood.

12:11 And the <120 said unto me: Look! And I looked, and <368 three
<387 pass away in righteousness; and <32 <32 were <31
even like unto the Lamb of God. And the <32 said unto me: These are
made <19 in the blood of the <154 <71 of <31 <70 in him.

12:12 And I, Nephi, also saw many of the fourth generation who <280
away in righteousness.

12:13 And it came to pass that I saw the <285 of the <390
<506 together.

12:14 And the <67 said unto me: <184 thy seed, and also the seed of
thy brethren.

12:15 And it came to pass that I looked and <118 the people of my
seed <43 together in <51 against the seed of my brethren;
and they were <14 <14 to battle.

12:16 And the <59 <278 unto me, <278 <60 the fountain of
filthy water which thy father saw; yea, even the river of <9 he
spake; and the depths thereof are the <4 of hell.

12:17 And the mists of darkness are the temptations of the devil, <28
blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and
leadeth them away into broad roads, that they perish and are lost.

12:18 And the large and spacious building, <38 thy <75 saw, is
vain imaginations and the pride of the <40 of men. And a <454 and
a <456 gulf divideth <327 yea, even the word of the justice of the
Eternal God, and the Messiah who is the Lamb of God, of whom the Holy
<437 beareth record, from the beginning of the world until this time,
and from this time henceforth and forever.

12:19 And while the <166 <166 <368 words, I <202 and saw that the
seed of my brethren did contend <203 my <238 according to the word
of the angel; and <306 of the <101 of my <16 and the <159
of the <160 I <39 that the seed of my <36 did overpower the
<250 of my <414

12:20 And it came to pass that I beheld, and saw the <19 of the seed
of my <31 that they had overcome my seed; and they went forth in
<281 upon the face of the land.

12:21 And I saw them <285 <285 in multitudes; and I saw wars
and rumors of wars among <177 and in wars and <9 of wars I saw
many <447 pass away.

12:22 And the <144 said unto me: <309 <147 <510 dwindle in
unbelief.

12:23 And it came to pass that I <96 after they had dwindled in
unbelief they became a dark, and loathsome, and a <338 people, full
of idleness and all manner of abominations.

1 Nephi Chapter 13

13:1 And it came to pass that the <67 <211 unto me, <377 Look!
And I <419 and <178 many nations and kingdoms.

13:2 And the <22 said unto me: What beholdest thou? And I said: I
behold many <23 and <23

13:3 And he said unto me: These are the <15 and kingdoms of the
Gentiles.

13:4 And it came to pass that I saw <159 the <21 of the Gentiles
the formation of a <353 church.

13:5 And the <67 said unto me: <156 the <17 of a church <389
is most abominable above all other churches, <9 slayeth the saints
of God, yea, and tortureth them and bindeth them down, and yoketh them
with a yoke of iron, and bringeth them down into captivity.

13:6 And it came to pass that I <138 this <70 and <50
church; and I saw the devil that he was the founder of it.

13:7 And I also saw gold, and silver, and silks, and scarlets, and
fine-twined linen, and all <210 of precious clothing; and I saw many
harlots.

13:8 And the <116 <205 unto me, <205 <117 the <36 and the
<38 and the <39 and the <40 and the <40 <40 and
the <39 clothing, and the harlots, are the desires of this <89
and <90 <162

13:9 And also for the praise of the <486 do they destroy the <150 of
God, and bring them down into <133

13:10 And it came to pass that I <273 and <135 many waters; and
they divided the <217 from the seed of my brethren.

13:11 And it came to pass that the <105 said unto me: <104 the wrath
of God is upon the seed of thy <28

13:12 And I <51 and <51 a man <268 the Gentiles, who was
separated from the seed of my <480 by the many <68 and I <22
the Spirit of God, that it came down and wrought upon the man; and he
went <496 upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, who
were in the promised <505

13:13 And it came to pass that I <49 the <48 of God, that it
<46 upon <310 Gentiles; and they went <45 out of captivity, upon
the many waters.

13:14 And it came to pass that I <35 many multitudes of the <154
upon the land of promise; and I <14 the <141 of God, that it was
upon the seed of my brethren; and they were scattered before the
<31 and were smitten.

13:15 And I <32 the <81 of the Lord, that it was upon the
<159 and they did prosper and obtain the land for their
inheritance; and I <27 that they were white, and exceedingly fair
and beautiful, like unto my people <55 they were slain.

13:16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, <31 that the <71 who
had gone <132 out of captivity did humble themselves <31 the Lord;
and the power of the Lord was with them.

13:17 And I <34 that <72 mother <35 were gathered together
upon the <210 and upon the land also, to battle against <27

13:18 And I <27 that the <43 of God was with them, and also that
the <163 of God was upon all those that were <44 <44 <33
them to battle.

13:19 And I, <98 <37 that the <63 that had gone out of
<97 were delivered by the <49 of God out of the hands of all
<252 nations.

13:20 And it came to pass that I, <39 <39 that they did <183
in the land; and I <11 a book, and it was carried <147 <363 <103

13:21 And the <399 said unto me: Knowest thou the meaning of the book?

13:22 And I said unto him: I know not.

13:23 And he said: <425 it proceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew. And
I, <71 <60 it; and he said unto me: The book that thou beholdest
is a record of the Jews, which contains the covenants of the <286
<8 he hath made unto the house of Israel; and it also containeth
many of the prophecies of the holy prophets; and it is a <38 like
unto the engravings <32 are upon the plates of brass, save there are
not so many; nevertheless, they contain the <55 of the <55
<23 he hath made unto the <55 of <55 wherefore, they are of
great worth unto the Gentiles.

13:24 And the <151 of the Lord said unto me: Thou hast <116 that the
book proceeded <175 from the <133 of a Jew; and when it <11
<12 from the <12 of a Jew it contained the fulness of the gospel of
the <71 of whom the twelve apostles bear record; and they bear <109
according to the truth <86 is in the Lamb of God.

13:25 Wherefore, these things go <49 from the Jews in purity unto the
<446 <29 to the <29 <29 is in God.

13:26 And after they go <26 by the hand of the <60 <60 of the
Lamb, from the Jews unto the <34 thou seest the formation of a
<138 and abominable church, <41 is most <5 above all <329
churches; for behold, they have taken away from the <108 of the Lamb
many parts <24 are plain and most precious; and also many <194
of the Lord have they <27 away.

13:27 And all this have they done that they might pervert the right
ways of the <149 that they <11 blind the eyes and harden the hearts
of the children of men.

13:28 <142 thou <95 that <119 the book hath gone <121 through
the <423 of the <103 and <98 <103 that <275 are many <81
and precious <168 <72 away from the <412 <93 is the book of the
Lamb of God.

13:29 And <45 <191 <27 and <26 <26 were <27 away it
goeth <52 unto all the nations of the Gentiles; and <21 it <12
<13 unto all the <13 of the <176 yea, even across the many
waters <55 thou hast seen with the Gentiles <7 have gone <25 out
of captivity, thou seest—because of the many <58 and <58 <58
<18 have been <61 out of the <88 <8 were <15 unto the
understanding of the <138 of men, <262 to the plainness <16
is in the Lamb of God—because of <97 <36 <11 are <34 away out
of the <223 of the <261 an exceedingly <147 many do stumble, yea,
insomuch that Satan hath <10 power over them.

13:30 Nevertheless, thou <493 that the <91 who have gone
<92 out of <91 and have been lifted up by the <28 of God
<285 all <285 nations, upon the face of the land <67 is choice
<14 all <14 lands, <8 is the land that the Lord God hath
covenanted with thy father that his seed should have for the land of
their inheritance; <480 thou <250 that the Lord God will not
suffer that the <77 will utterly destroy the mixture of thy seed,
<49 are among thy brethren.

13:31 Neither will he <25 that the <25 shall <24 the seed
of thy <19

13:32 <19 will the Lord God <21 that the <21 <21 forever
remain in that awful state of blindness, <47 thou <139 they are
in, because of the <206 and most <222 <394 of the <180 of the
Lamb <22 have been kept back by that <331 <331 whose
<444 thou hast seen.

13:33 Wherefore saith the Lamb of God: I will be merciful unto the
<293 unto the visiting of the remnant of the house of Israel in
<215 judgment.

13:34 And it came to pass that the angel of the Lord spake unto me,
saying: Behold, <49 the Lamb of God, <346 I have visited the <41
of the <42 of Israel—and this <8 of whom I speak is the seed of
thy father—wherefore, <25 I have <25 them in judgment, and
smitten them by the hand of the <83 and <18 the <152 do
stumble exceedingly, <139 of the most <140 and <139 <139 of
the <140 of the Lamb <139 have been kept back by that <139
<140 <10 is the mother of harlots, <86 the Lamb—I will be
<133 unto the <45 in that day, <341 that I will bring
<325 unto them, in mine own power, much of my gospel, <36 <218 be
<61 and precious, <37 the Lamb.

13:35 For, behold, <9 the Lamb: I will manifest myself unto thy
<282 that they <28 write many <411 <33 I <6 minister unto
<48 <7 <6 be <39 and precious; and <115 thy seed <9 be
destroyed, and dwindle in unbelief, and also the seed of thy brethren,
<51 <447 <36 <19 be hid up, to come <86 unto the <148
by the gift and <409 of the <78

13:36 And in them <26 be written my <100 <84 the <469 and my
rock and my salvation.

13:37 And blessed are they who <24 seek to <135 <48 my Zion at
that day, for they <13 have the gift and the <54 of the Holy Ghost;
and if they endure unto the end they <20 be <483 up at the last
day, and <10 be saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb; and
whoso <13 publish peace, yea, tidings of <320 joy, how beautiful
upon the mountains <14 they be.

13:38 And it came to pass that I beheld the <303 of the seed of my
<148 and also the book of the Lamb of God, <182 had proceeded
<103 from the mouth of the Jew, that it came <10 from the <260
unto the <38 of the seed of my <480

13:39 And <208 it had come <23 unto them I <60 other books, <44
came <10 by the <134 of the <173 from the <39 unto <241 unto
the convincing of the <9 and the <47 of the seed of my
<85 and also the Jews who were scattered upon all the face of the
earth, that the records of the prophets and of the twelve apostles of
the Lamb are true.

13:40 And the <462 <459 unto me, <458 These last records, <78
thou hast seen among the <273 <163 establish the truth of the
first, <16 are of the <42 <42 of the <93 and <18 make
known the <332 and <432 <310 <19 have been taken away from
them; and <18 make <17 to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that
the Lamb of God is the Son of the Eternal Father, and the Savior of the
world; and that all men must come unto him, or they cannot be saved.

13:41 And they must come according to the words <63 <55 be
established by the <220 of the <281 and the <14 of the Lamb <16
be made <73 in the <151 of thy <443 as well as in the <9 of
the <115 <115 of the <31 wherefore they both <28 be
<44 in one; for there is one God and one Shepherd over all the
earth.

13:42 And the time cometh that he <29 <496 himself unto all
nations, both unto the Jews and also unto the Gentiles; and <278 he
has manifested <20 unto the Jews and also unto the <195 then
he <34 <34 <14 unto the <268 and also unto the Jews, and
the last <15 be <208 and the first <6 be last.

1 Nephi Chapter 14

14:1 And it <16 come to pass, that if the <39 <8 hearken unto
the Lamb of God in that day that he <13 <58 <58 unto them in
word, and also in power, in very deed, unto the taking away of their
stumbling blocks—

14:2 And harden not <11 hearts against the Lamb of God, they <39 be
numbered <302 the seed of thy father; yea, they <12 be <11
<12 the house of Israel; and they <11 be a blessed people upon the
promised land forever; they <12 be no more brought down into
captivity; and the <28 of Israel <14 no more be confounded.

14:3 And that great pit, <267 hath been digged for them by that <10
and abominable church, <13 was founded by the devil and his children,
that he might lead away the souls of men down to hell—yea, that <28
pit <26 hath been <39 for the destruction of men <61 be filled
by those who <13 it, unto <128 utter destruction, saith the Lamb of
God; not the <24 of the soul, save it be the casting of it into
that hell <45 hath no end.

14:4 For behold, this is <367 to the captivity of the devil, and
also <10 to the justice of God, upon all <61 who will work
wickedness and abomination before him.

14:5 And it came to pass that the <508 <508 unto me, Nephi, <509
Thou hast beheld that if the <263 repent it <103 be well with
<479 and thou also knowest concerning the covenants of the Lord unto
the <186 of <214 and thou also hast heard that whoso repenteth not
must perish.

14:6 Therefore, wo be unto the <46 if it so be that they <273
<145 <273 <273 the Lamb of God.

14:7 For the time cometh, <157 the Lamb of God, that I will work a
<193 and a marvelous work <280 the children of men; a work <157
<92 be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the other—either to
the convincing of them unto peace and life eternal, or unto the
deliverance of them to the hardness of <74 <74 and the blindness
of <7 minds unto <3 being <312 down into captivity, and also
into <237 both temporally and spiritually, <196 to the
<207 of the <207 of <70 I have spoken.

14:8 And it came to pass that when the <192 had spoken these words, he
said unto me: Rememberest thou the <177 of the Father unto the
<177 of Israel? I said unto him, Yea.

14:9 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look, and behold that
<145 and <365 <365 <67 is the mother of abominations, whose
founder is the devil.

14:10 And he said unto me: Behold there are save two churches only; the
one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the <11 of
the devil; wherefore, <249 belongeth not to the <11 of the Lamb of
God <11 to that <69 <67 <67 is the <67 of
abominations; and she is the whore of all the earth.

14:11 And it came to pass that I looked and <330 the <20 of all the
earth, and she sat upon many waters; and she had dominion over all the
<15 <263 all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people.

14:12 And it came to pass that I <41 the <84 of the Lamb of God,
and its numbers were few, because of the <413 and abominations of
the <62 who sat upon many <56 nevertheless, I <31 that the
<33 of the Lamb, who were the saints of God, were also upon all the
face of the earth; and <284 dominions upon the face of the earth were
small, <53 of the <53 of the <145 <51 whom I saw.

14:13 And it came to pass that I <58 that the <19 <160 of
<77 did gather together multitudes upon the face of all the
<127 <127 all the nations of the Gentiles, to fight <428 the Lamb
of God.

14:14 And it came to pass that I, <511 <47 the power of the Lamb
of God, that it descended upon the <108 of the <118 of the <118
and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all
the face of the <122 and they were armed with righteousness and with
the <49 of God in <99 glory.

14:15 And it came to pass that I <68 that the wrath of God was
poured out upon that <25 and <357 <290 insomuch that <337
were wars and rumors of wars <121 all the <121 and kindreds of the
<294

14:16 And as <24 began to be wars and <25 of wars <25 all the
<26 <330 belonged to the <171 of <398 the <456 spake
unto me, saying: Behold, the <69 of God is upon the <18 of
harlots; and behold, thou seest all <476 things—

14:17 And when the day cometh that the <28 of God is <96 out upon
the <31 of harlots, <56 is the <103 and <103 <169 of all
the <219 <459 <458 is the devil, then, at that day, the work of
the Father shall commence, in preparing the way for the fulfilling of
his covenants, <40 he hath made to his <200 who are of the house of
Israel.

14:18 And it came to pass that the <114 <114 unto me, <113 Look!

14:19 And I <437 and <192 a man, and he was dressed in a white
robe.

14:20 And the <32 said unto me: Behold one of the twelve apostles of
the Lamb.

14:21 <158 he <91 see and write the remainder of <150 things;
yea, and also many things <93 have been.

14:22 And he <24 also <23 concerning the end of the world.

14:23 Wherefore, the <25 <25 he <18 <17 are just and true; and
behold they are written in the book <17 thou <97 proceeding out of
the mouth of the Jew; and at the time they proceeded out of the <13
of the Jew, or, at the time the book <15 out of the <15 of the
Jew, the <60 <43 were <49 were plain and pure, and most
precious and easy to the understanding of all men.

14:24 And <271 the <27 <27 this apostle of the Lamb <91 <91
are many <12 <12 thou hast seen; and <20 the <141 shalt
thou see.

14:25 But the <19 <19 thou <13 see hereafter thou <4 not
write; for the Lord God hath ordained the <46 of the Lamb of God
that he should <51 them.

14:26 And also others who have been, to them hath he shown all things,
and they have <106 them; and they are sealed up to come forth in
their purity, according to the truth <68 is in the <508 in the own
due time of the <508 unto the <309 of <308

14:27 And I, Nephi, heard and bear record, that the name of the <86
of the Lamb was John, <46 to the word of the angel.

14:28 And <136 I, <31 am forbidden that I <103 <103 the
<145 of the <137 <69 I saw and heard; wherefore the <8
<9 I have <99 sufficeth me; and I have <6 but a small part
of the <19 <18 I saw.

14:29 And I bear record that I saw the <16 <16 my father saw, and
the <365 of the Lord did make them known unto me.

14:30 And now I make an end of speaking <340 the <32 <32 I
saw while I was carried away in the spirit; and if all the <17 <17
I saw are not written, the <9 <9 I have <86 are true. And
thus it is. Amen.

1 Nephi Chapter 15

15:1 And it came to pass that after I, <145 had been <53 away in
the spirit, and seen all <432 <237 I returned to the tent of my
father.

15:2 And it came to pass that I <402 my brethren, and they were
disputing one with another <105 the <79 my <136 had spoken
unto <295

15:3 For he truly spake many great <18 unto them, <99 were hard to
be understood, save a man <218 inquire of the Lord; and they being
hard in <296 hearts, therefore they did not look unto the Lord as they
ought.

15:4 And now I, <110 was grieved because of the hardness of <29
<30 and also, <10 of the <61 <59 I had seen, and knew they
must unavoidably come to pass <17 of the <79 wickedness of the
children of men.

15:5 And it came to pass that I was overcome <24 of my afflictions,
for I considered that mine afflictions were <33 above all, <15 of
the destruction of my people, for I had <156 <73 fall.

15:6 And it came to pass that <205 I had received strength I <147
unto my <177 desiring to know of them the cause of <31
disputations.

15:7 And they said: Behold, we cannot understand the words <111 our
<192 hath <192 <199 the natural branches of the olive-tree,
and also <10 the Gentiles.

15:8 And I said unto them: Have ye inquired of the Lord?

15:9 And they said unto me: We have not; for the Lord maketh no such
thing <367 unto us.

15:10 <67 I said unto <38 How is it that ye do not keep the
commandments of the <46 How is it that ye will perish, <146 of the
<213 of your hearts?

15:11 Do ye not remember the <216 <105 the Lord hath said?—If ye
will not harden your <234 and ask me in faith, believing that ye
shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely <361
<33 <12 be made <87 unto you.

15:12 <87 I say unto you, that the house of Israel was compared
unto an <151 by the Spirit of the Lord <65 was in our father;
and behold are we not broken off from the <30 of Israel, and are we
not a branch of the <12 of Israel?

15:13 And now, the <154 <38 our <207 meaneth <196 the
grafting in of the <211 <211 through the fulness of the
Gentiles, is, that in the latter days, when our seed <99 have
dwindled in unbelief, yea, for the space of many years, and many
generations <289 the Messiah <20 be manifested in body unto the
<355 of men, then <12 the <48 of the gospel of the <21
come unto the <55 and from the Gentiles unto the remnant of our
seed—

15:14 And at that day <33 the <15 of our seed know that they are
of the <118 of <130 and that they are the covenant people of the
<484 and then <29 they know and come to the knowledge of <356
forefathers, and also to the <9 of the <76 of <12 Redeemer,
<147 was ministered unto <7 fathers by him; wherefore, they <34
come to the <23 of <13 Redeemer and the very points of his
doctrine, that they may know how to come unto him and be saved.

15:15 And then at that day will they not rejoice and give praise unto
<40 everlasting God, <3 rock and <3 salvation? Yea, at that
day, will they not receive the <461 and nourishment from the true
vine? Yea, will they not come unto the true fold of God?

15:16 <305 I say unto you, Yea; they <95 be remembered again among
the <152 of Israel; they <11 be grafted in, being a <258 <284
of the <319 into the true olive-tree.

15:17 And this is what our <286 meaneth; and he <289 that it will
not come to pass until <256 they are scattered by the Gentiles; and he
<20 that it <52 come by way of the <247 that the Lord may
show his power unto the <11 for the very cause that he <24 be
rejected of the Jews, or of the <90 of Israel.

15:18 Wherefore, our <70 hath not spoken of our seed alone, but also
of all the <23 of <265 pointing to the <263 <232 should be
fulfilled in the <362 days; <9 <11 the Lord made to our
<38 Abraham, saying: In thy seed <63 all the kindreds of the earth
be blessed.

15:19 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake much unto them
<425 <503 things; yea, I <10 unto them <8 the
restoration of the Jews in the <60 days.

15:20 And I did rehearse unto them the words of Isaiah, who <29
<28 the <27 of the <125 or of the <102 of <215 and
<177 they were restored they <104 no more be confounded, neither
<7 they be <189 again. And it came to pass that I did speak
many <48 unto my brethren, that they were pacified and did humble
themselves before the Lord.

15:21 And it came to pass that they did <31 unto me again, <141
What <230 this thing <157 our <151 saw in a dream? What <11
the tree <12 he saw?

15:22 And I said unto them: It was a representation of the tree of
life.

15:23 And they said unto me: What <36 the rod of iron <37 our
<50 saw, that led to the tree?

15:24 And I said unto them that it was the word of God, and whoso would
hearken unto the word of God, and <9 hold fast unto it, they <6
never perish; <152 could the temptations and the fiery darts of the
adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to
destruction.

15:25 <312 I, <247 did exhort them to give heed unto the word
of the Lord; yea, I did <15 them with all the energies of my soul,
and with all the faculty <108 I possessed, that they <70 give heed
to the word of God and remember to keep his commandments always in all
things.

15:26 And they said unto me: What <148 the river of water <40 our
<148 saw?

15:27 And I said unto them that the <17 <17 my <16 saw was
filthiness; and so much was his mind swallowed up in other things that
he beheld not the filthiness of the water.

15:28 And I said unto them that it was an awful gulf, <43 separated
the wicked from the tree of life, and also from the saints of God.

15:29 And I said unto them that it was a <260 of that <35
hell, <36 the angel said unto me was prepared for the wicked.

15:30 And I said unto them that our <99 also saw that the justice of
God did also divide the <67 from the righteous; and the brightness
thereof was like unto the <7 of a flaming fire, <53 ascendeth
up unto God forever and ever, and hath no end.

15:31 And they said unto me: Doth this <371 mean the torment of the
body in the days of probation, or doth it mean the final state of the
soul <460 the death of the temporal body, or doth it <414 of the
<177 <63 are temporal?

15:32 And it came to pass that I said unto them that it was a
<144 of <25 both <36 and spiritual; for the day
<496 come that they must be judged of their works, yea, even the
works <48 were done by the <27 body in <15 days of probation.

15:33 <350 if they <34 die in <14 wickedness they must be
cast off also, as to the <58 <35 are spiritual, <3 are
pertaining to righteousness; wherefore, they must be brought to stand
before God, to be <65 of <36 works; and if <4 <64 have been
<286 they must needs be filthy; and if they be filthy it must
<11 be that they cannot dwell in the kingdom of God; if so, the
<7 of God must be <24 also.

15:34 But behold, I say unto you, the <18 of God is not filthy, and
there <38 any unclean <213 enter into the <16 of God; wherefore
<13 must <56 be a place of <75 <300 for that <108 is
filthy.

15:35 And <20 is a <18 prepared, yea, even that <330 hell of <20
I have spoken, and the devil is the preparator of it; <46 the
<251 <251 of the souls of men is to <105 in the <64 of God, or
to be cast out because of that <343 of <42 I have spoken.

15:36 <200 the <347 are rejected from the righteous, and also
from that tree of <422 whose fruit is most precious and most desirable
above all <470 fruits; yea, and it is the greatest of all the gifts of
God. And thus I spake unto my brethren. Amen.

1 Nephi Chapter 16

16:1 And now it came to pass that <347 I, Nephi, had made an end of
speaking to my brethren, behold they said unto me: Thou hast declared
unto us hard things, more than we are able to bear.

16:2 And it came to pass that I said unto them that I knew that I had
spoken hard <306 against the wicked, according to the truth; and the
righteous have I justified, and testified that they <340 be lifted up
at the last day; <324 the guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for
it cutteth them to the very center.

16:3 And now my <97 if ye were <46 and were willing to
hearken to the truth, and give heed unto it, that ye might walk
uprightly <366 God, then ye would not murmur <222 of the <22
and say: Thou speakest hard <95 <95 us.

16:4 And it came to pass that I, <163 did exhort my <60 with
all diligence, to keep the commandments of the Lord.

16:5 And it came to pass that they did humble themselves <61 the
Lord; insomuch that I had joy and great hopes of them, that they <73
walk in the paths of righteousness.

16:6 Now, all these <75 were said and done as my father dwelt in a
tent in the valley <318 he called Lemuel.

16:7 And it came to pass that I, <92 took one of the daughters of
Ishmael to wife; and also, my brethren took of the <13 of <12
to <13 and also Zoram took the eldest daughter of <12 to wife.

16:8 And thus my <66 had fulfilled all the <127 of the Lord
<67 had been given unto him. And <47 I, <61 had been blessed of
the Lord exceedingly.

16:9 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord <365 unto my
<47 by night, and commanded him that on the morrow he <282 take
his journey into the wilderness.

16:10 And it came to pass that as my <31 arose in the morning, and
went forth to the tent door, to his <187 astonishment he beheld upon
the ground a round ball of curious workmanship; and it was of fine
brass. And within the ball were two spindles; and the one pointed the
way whither we <72 go into the <69

16:11 And it came to pass that we did gather together whatsoever <223
we <23 carry into the wilderness, and all the remainder of our
provisions <156 the Lord had <157 unto us; and we did take seed of
every kind that we <353 <31 into the <54

16:12 And it came to pass that we did take our tents and depart into
the <52 across the river Laman.

16:13 And it came to pass that we traveled for the space of four days,
nearly a south-southeast direction, and we did pitch our <39 again;
and we did call the name of the place Shazer.

16:14 And it came to pass that we did take our bows and our arrows, and
go <190 into the wilderness to slay food for our families; and after
we had slain food for our families we did return again to our <7
in the <97 to the <56 of <57 And we did go <40 <18 in
the <15 following the same <89 keeping in the most
fertile parts of the <14 <170 were in the borders near the Red
Sea.

16:15 And it came to pass that we did travel for the <133 of many
<134 slaying food by the way, with our bows and our arrows and our
stones and our slings.

16:16 And we did follow the directions of the ball, <61 led us in the
more <73 <73 of the <220

16:17 And <127 we had <192 for the <59 of many <58 we did
<187 our <187 for the <12 of a time, that we <254 <122 rest
ourselves and obtain food for our families.

16:18 And it came to pass that as I, <442 went <147 to slay food,
behold, I did break my bow, <77 was made of fine steel; and <67 I
did <14 my bow, <20 my brethren were angry with me because of the
loss of my bow, for we did <62 no food.

16:19 And it came to pass that we did <223 without food to our
families, and being much fatigued, <37 of their journeying, they
did suffer much for the want of <37

16:20 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael
did begin to murmur exceedingly, <38 of <38 sufferings and
afflictions in the wilderness; and also my <505 began to <18
against the Lord his God; yea, and they were all exceedingly sorrowful,
even that they did <19 <18 the Lord.

16:21 Now it came to pass that I, <159 having been afflicted with my
<137 <58 of the loss of my bow, and <64 bows <17 lost
<5 springs, it <60 to be <49 difficult, yea, insomuch that
we could <149 no <112

16:22 And it came to pass that I, <49 did speak much unto my
brethren, <49 they had hardened <40 hearts again, even unto
complaining <82 the Lord <10 God.

16:23 And it came to pass that I, <35 did make out of wood a bow,
and out of a straight stick, an arrow; wherefore, I did arm myself with
a bow and an arrow, with a sling and with stones. And I said unto my
father: Whither shall I go to <96 food?

16:24 And it came to pass that he did inquire of the Lord, for they had
humbled themselves <98 of my words; for I did say many things unto
them in the energy of my soul.

16:25 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my
father; and he was truly chastened <44 of his murmuring <135 the
<58 <177 that he was brought down into the depths of sorrow.

16:26 And it came to pass that the <44 of the Lord said unto him:
Look upon the <464 and behold the <80 <391 are written.

16:27 And it came to pass that when my <297 beheld the <19 <19
were written upon the <30 he did fear and tremble <327 and
also my <274 and the sons of <343 and our wives.

16:28 And it came to pass that I, <217 <41 the pointers <41 were
in the <40 that they did work according to the faith and diligence
and heed <19 we did give unto them.

16:29 And there was also <71 upon them a new writing, <20 was
plain to be read, <7 did give us understanding concerning the ways
of the Lord; and it was <28 and changed from time to time,
<59 to the <59 and <59 <29 we gave unto it. And thus we
see that by small means the Lord can bring about great things.

16:30 And it came to pass that I, <111 did go forth up into the top
of the mountain, <50 to the directions <48 were given upon the
ball.

16:31 And it came to pass that I did slay wild beasts, <243 that I
did <324 food for our families.

16:32 And it came to pass that I did return to our tents, bearing the
beasts <52 I had slain; and now when they <186 that I had obtained
food, how <97 was <427 joy! And it came to pass that they did humble
<356 before the <307 and did give thanks unto him.

16:33 And it came to pass that we did again take our journey, traveling
nearly the same course as in the beginning; and after we had traveled
for the space of many days we did pitch our tents <500 that we might
tarry for the <17 of a time.

16:34 And it came to pass that <299 died, and was buried in the
place <114 was called Nahom.

16:35 And it came to pass that the daughters of <26 did mourn
<339 <417 of the loss of <123 father, and <8 of <5
afflictions in the wilderness; and they did murmur <433 my <16
<16 he had <432 them out of the land of Jerusalem, saying: Our
<394 is dead; yea, and we have wandered much in the wilderness, and
we have suffered much affliction, hunger, thirst, and fatigue; and
<132 all these sufferings we must perish in the wilderness with
hunger.

16:36 And thus they did <65 <65 my <65 and also <5 me;
and they were desirous to <242 <183 to Jerusalem.

16:37 And Laman said unto Lemuel and also unto the sons of Ishmael:
Behold, let us slay our <37 and also our brother <333 who has
taken it upon him to be our ruler and our teacher, who are his elder
brethren.

16:38 Now, he says that the Lord has talked with him, and also that
angels have ministered unto him. But behold, we know that he lies unto
us; and he tells us <122 things, and he worketh many things by his
cunning arts, that he may deceive our eyes, thinking, perhaps, that he
may lead us away into some strange <202 and <156 he has led us
away, he has thought to make himself a king and a <96 over us, that
he may do with us <438 to his will and pleasure. And <34 this
manner did my <131 <153 stir up <253 hearts to anger.

16:39 And it came to pass that the Lord was with us, yea, even the
voice of the Lord came and did speak many words unto them, and did
chasten them exceedingly; and <52 they were chastened by the <25 of
the Lord they did turn away <57 anger, and did repent of <6 sins,
<495 that the Lord did bless us <237 with <460 that we did not
perish.

1 Nephi Chapter 17

17:1 And it came to pass that we did <28 take our journey in the
<154 and we did travel <454 eastward from that time forth. And
we did <11 and wade through much affliction in the <23 and
our women did bear children in the wilderness.

17:2 And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we
did live upon raw meat in the <382 our <35 did give plenty of
suck for <115 children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men;
and they began to bear <17 journeyings without murmurings.

17:3 And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled.
And if it so be that the <85 of men keep the <19 of God
he doth nourish <201 and strengthen <3 and provide means whereby
they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them; wherefore,
he did <18 <18 for us <104 we did sojourn in the <127

17:4 And we did <11 for the space of many years, yea, even eight
years in the <22

17:5 And we did come to the land <53 we called Bountiful, because of
its much fruit and also wild honey; and all <394 <389 were prepared
of the Lord that we might not <249 And we beheld the sea, <34 we
<35 Irreantum, which, being interpreted, is many waters.

17:6 And it came to pass that we did pitch our tents by the seashore;
and notwithstanding we had suffered many afflictions and much
difficulty, yea, even so much that we cannot write them all, we were
exceedingly rejoiced when we came to the <33 and we <61 the
place <99 <99 of its much fruit.

17:7 And it came to pass that <378 I, Nephi, had been in the land of
Bountiful for the <154 of many days, the <390 of the Lord came unto
me, saying: Arise, and get thee into the mountain. And it came to pass
that I arose and went up into the mountain, and cried unto the Lord.

17:8 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, <43 Thou
shalt construct a ship, <76 the <505 <163 I shall show thee, that
I may carry thy people across <194 <167

17:9 And I said: Lord, whither <22 I go that I may find ore to
molten, that I may make tools to <47 the ship <47 the <47
<48 thou hast shown unto me?

17:10 And it came to pass that the Lord told me <45 I should go to
find ore, that I <249 make tools.

17:11 And it came to pass that I, <169 did make a bellows wherewith
to blow the fire, of the skins of beasts; and <65 I had made a
bellows, that I <40 have <23 to blow the <22 I did smite two
stones together that I <16 make fire.

17:12 For the Lord had not hitherto <276 that we <80 make much
<30 as we journeyed in the wilderness; for he <142 I will make thy
food become sweet, that ye cook it not;

17:13 And I will also be your light in the <30 and I will
prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye <182 keep my
commandments; <456 inasmuch as ye <9 keep my <489 ye
<6 be led towards the promised land; and ye <9 know that it is by
me that ye are led.

17:14 Yea, and the Lord said also that: After ye have arrived in the
<34 land, ye <33 know that I, the <246 am God; and that I, the
<8 did deliver you from destruction; yea, that I did bring you out
of the land of Jerusalem.

17:15 Wherefore, I, <209 did strive to keep the <89 of the
<35 and I did exhort my brethren to faithfulness and diligence.

17:16 And it came to pass that I did make <296 of the ore <291 I did
molten out of the rock.

17:17 And when my <38 saw that I was about to build a <368 they
began to murmur against me, <382 Our brother is a fool, for he
thinketh that he can <23 a ship; yea, and he also <11 that he
can cross <385 great <386

17:18 And thus my <53 did complain <41 me, and were desirous
that they <285 not labor, for they did not believe that I could <45
a <46 neither would they <11 that I was instructed of the <470

17:19 And now it came to pass that I, <156 was exceedingly sorrowful
because of the hardness of their hearts; and now when they saw that I
<110 to be <20 they were glad in <18 hearts, insomuch that
they did rejoice over me, <123 We knew that ye <71 not <461 a
<141 for we knew that ye were lacking in judgment; <304 thou
canst not accomplish so <123 a work.

17:20 And thou art like unto our father, led away by the foolish
imaginations of his heart; yea, he hath led us out of the land of
Jerusalem, and we have wandered in the wilderness for <168 many years;
and our women have toiled, being big with child; and they have borne
children in the <23 and <442 all things, save it were death;
and it <164 have been better that they had died <409 they came out
of Jerusalem than to have <28 <52 afflictions.

17:21 Behold, <7 many years we have <13 in the wilderness,
<296 time we <219 have enjoyed our possessions and the land of our
inheritance; yea, and we <15 have been happy.

17:22 And we know that the people who were in the land of <60
were a righteous people; for they kept the statutes and judgments of
the <378 and all his commandments, according to the law of Moses;
<186 we know that they are a <31 <31 and our father
hath judged them, and hath led us away <260 we <125 hearken unto
his words; yea, and our <359 is like unto him. And after this manner
of language did my <339 <379 and <340 <340 us.

17:23 And it came to pass that I, <307 spake unto <51 <273 Do ye
<335 that our fathers, who were the <195 of Israel, <58 have
been led away out of the hands of the Egyptians if they had not
hearkened unto the words of the Lord?

17:24 Yea, do ye suppose that they <35 have been led out of bondage,
if the Lord had not commanded Moses that he should lead them out of
bondage?

17:25 Now ye know that the <71 of Israel were in bondage; and ye
know that they were laden with tasks, <231 were grievous to be borne;
<172 ye know that it must needs be a good thing for <118 that
they <55 be brought out of bondage.

17:26 Now ye know that <72 was <75 of the Lord to do that <390
work; and ye know that by his word the waters of the Red Sea were
divided hither and thither, and they passed through on dry ground.

17:27 But ye know that the <156 were drowned in the Red Sea, who
were the armies of Pharaoh.

17:28 And ye also know that they were fed with manna in the wilderness.

17:29 Yea, and ye also know that Moses, by his word <301 to the
power of God <136 was in him, smote the rock, and there came forth
water, that the <167 of <167 <367 quench their thirst.

17:30 And notwithstanding they <456 led, the Lord <13 God, <2
Redeemer, going <434 <157 leading them by day and giving light unto
them by night, and doing all things for them <59 were expedient for
man to receive, they hardened <34 hearts and blinded <4 minds, and
reviled <329 <178 and <3 the true and living God.

17:31 And it came to pass that <104 to his word he did destroy
them; and <10 to his word he did lead <9 and <9 to his
word he did do all <69 for <13 and <121 was not any <252 done
save it were by his word.

17:32 And <410 they had crossed the river Jordan he did make them
mighty unto the driving out of the <151 of the land, yea, unto the
scattering them to destruction.

17:33 And now, do ye <374 that the <23 of this <23 who were
in the land of promise, who were driven out by our <434 do ye
<25 that they were righteous? Behold, I say unto you, Nay.

17:34 Do ye <17 that our fathers <417 have been more choice than
they if they had been <29 I say unto you, Nay.

17:35 <38 the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one; he that is righteous
is favored of God. But behold, this people had rejected every word of
God, and they were ripe in iniquity; and the fulness of the wrath of
God was upon <172 and the Lord did curse the land <226 <268 and
bless it unto our fathers; yea, he did <15 it <14 them unto <251
destruction, and he did <19 it unto our <103 unto <12 obtaining
<342 over it.

17:36 <92 the Lord hath created the earth that it <468 be
inhabited; and he hath <12 his <175 that they <12 possess
it.

17:37 And he raiseth up a <115 nation, and destroyeth the nations
of the wicked.

17:38 And he leadeth away the <19 into precious lands, and the
wicked he destroyeth, and curseth the land unto them for <80 sakes.

17:39 He ruleth high in the heavens, for it is his throne, and this
<84 is his footstool.

17:40 And he loveth those who will have him to be <38 God. <110 he
loved our <254 and he covenanted with <158 yea, even Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob; and he remembered the covenants <420 he had made;
wherefore, he did bring them out of the land of Egypt.

17:41 And he did straiten them in the wilderness with his rod; for they
<445 <60 hearts, even as ye have; and the Lord straitened them
because of <14 iniquity. He sent fiery flying serpents among <237
and <392 they were bitten he prepared a way that they might be healed;
and the labor <77 they had to perform was to look; and <39 of the
simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, <449 were many who
perished.

17:42 And they did harden <64 hearts from time to time, and they did
revile <282 Moses, and also <4 God; nevertheless, ye know that
they were led forth by his matchless <282 into the land of promise.

17:43 And now, <94 all these things, the time has come that they have
become wicked, yea, nearly unto ripeness; and I know not but they are
at this day about to be destroyed; for I know that the day must surely
come that they must be destroyed, save a few only, who shall be led
away into captivity.

17:44 Wherefore, the Lord commanded my father that he <338 depart
into the wilderness; and the Jews also sought to take away his life;
yea, and ye also have <12 to take away his <12 <249 ye are
murderers in your <147 and ye are like unto them.

17:45 Ye are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord your
God. Ye have seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard
his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still
small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel his
words; <79 he has <25 unto you like unto the <39 of
thunder, <269 did cause the <393 to shake as if it were to divide
asunder.

17:46 And ye also know that by the <230 of his almighty word he can
<32 the <32 that it <178 pass away; yea, and ye know that by his
word he can <19 the rough places to be made smooth, and smooth <7
<26 be broken up. O, then, why is it, that ye can be so hard in your
hearts?

17:47 <457 my soul is rent with anguish <355 of you, and my heart
is pained; I fear lest ye <43 be cast off forever. <25 I am full
of the Spirit of God, insomuch that my frame has no strength.

17:48 And now it came to pass that when I had <154 <335 words, they
were angry with me, and were desirous to throw me into the depths of
the sea; and as they came <378 to lay <406 hands upon me I <230 unto
them, saying: In the name of the Almighty God, I command you that ye
touch me not, for I am filled with the <179 of God, even unto the
consuming of my flesh; and whoso <110 lay his <47 upon me <6
wither even as a dried reed; and he <10 be as naught before the <35
of God, for God <12 smite him.

17:49 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto them that they
<387 murmur no more <489 <99 father; neither <8 they
withhold <7 labor from me, for God had <411 me that I <15
build a ship.

17:50 And I said unto them: If God had <21 me to do all things I
<334 do <396 If he <30 <130 me that I <5 say unto this
water, be thou earth, it <10 be earth; and if I <6 say it, it
would be done.

17:51 And now, if the Lord has such great power, and has wrought so
many miracles among the children of men, how is it that he cannot
instruct me, that I <44 <94 a ship?

17:52 And it came to pass that I, <140 said many <91 unto my
brethren, <285 that they were confounded and <99 not contend
<147 me; <146 durst they lay <145 <204 upon me nor <233 me
with <9 fingers, even for the space of many days. Now they <23 not
do this lest they <66 <226 <215 me, so powerful was the <339
of God; and thus it had <103 upon <152

17:53 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Stretch <316
thine hand again unto thy <86 and they <250 not <46 <46
thee, but I will shock <325 saith the Lord, and this will I do, that
they may know that I am the Lord <92 God.

17:54 And it came to pass that I stretched <53 my hand unto my
<52 and they did not <52 <52 me; but the Lord did shake
<53 even according to the word which he had spoken.

17:55 And now, they said: We know of a surety that the Lord is with
<87 for we know that it is the <356 of the Lord that has shaken us.
And they fell down <58 me, and were about to worship me, but I <273
not suffer <64 <442 I am thy brother, yea, even thy younger
brother; wherefore, <21 the Lord thy God, and honor thy father and
thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land <93 the Lord thy
God <168 give thee.

1 Nephi Chapter 18

18:1 And it came to pass that they did <50 the <179 and did go
<154 with me; and we did work timbers of curious workmanship. And the
Lord did show me from time to time after what manner I <268 work the
<23 of the <432

18:2 Now I, <333 did not work the <15 <24 the <24 <84 was
learned by men, <328 did I <365 the ship <15 the <15 of men;
but I did <12 it <11 the <11 <26 the Lord had shown unto me;
<141 it was not <15 the <15 of men.

18:3 And I, <58 did go into the mount oft, and I did pray oft unto
the Lord; wherefore the Lord showed unto me <453 things.

18:4 And it came to pass that <45 I had finished the ship, <270
to the word of the <150 my brethren beheld that it was good, and that
the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine; <79 they did
humble themselves <371 <253 the Lord.

18:5 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my
father, that we <168 arise and go down into the <168

18:6 And it came to pass that on the morrow, <83 we had prepared all
things, much fruits and meat from the wilderness, and honey in
abundance, and provisions <98 to that <164 the Lord had
commanded us, we did go down into the <115 with all our loading and
our seeds, and whatsoever thing we had brought with us, every one
<36 to his age; <114 we did all go down into the <32 with
our wives and our children.

18:7 And now, my <348 had begat two sons in the wilderness; the elder
was called Jacob and the <376 Joseph.

18:8 And it came to pass <111 we had all gone down into the <50 and
had taken with us our <107 and things <106 had been <104
us, we did put <354 into the sea and were driven <7 <193 the wind
towards the promised land.

18:9 And <49 we had been <19 <19 <19 the wind for the space
of many days, behold, my <246 and the sons of Ishmael and also
their <115 began to make <240 merry, insomuch that they <8 to
dance, and to sing, and to speak with much rudeness, yea, even that
they did forget by what power they had been <172 thither; yea, they
were lifted up unto exceeding rudeness.

18:10 And I, <357 <44 to fear <299 lest the Lord <269 be
angry with us, and smite us because of our iniquity, that we <15 be
swallowed up in the depths of the sea; <213 I, <36 <36 to
<74 to them with much soberness; but behold they were <39 with me,
saying: We will not that our <200 brother shall be a ruler over us.

18:11 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel did take me and bind me
with cords, and they did treat me with much harshness; nevertheless,
the Lord did suffer it that he might show <184 his power, unto the
fulfilling of his word <229 he had spoken concerning the wicked.

18:12 And it came to pass that <216 they had bound me <187 that I
could not move, the compass, <31 had been <390 of the <466 did
cease to work.

18:13 Wherefore, they knew not whither they <149 steer the <296
<36 that there arose a great storm, yea, a <4 and terrible
tempest, and we were <270 back upon the waters for the <270 of three
days; and they <171 to be frightened <208 lest they <43 be
drowned in the sea; nevertheless they did not loose me.

18:14 And on the fourth day, <87 we had been <47 back, the tempest
<38 to be <37 sore.

18:15 And it came to pass that we were about to be <240 up in the
<241 of the sea. And <140 we had been <39 back upon the <86
for the <87 of four <356 my <355 <48 to see that the judgments
of God were upon them, and that they must perish save that they <99
repent of <371 iniquities; <286 they came unto me, and loosed
the bands <93 were upon my wrist, and <289 they had swollen
exceedingly; and also mine ankles were much swollen, and <164 was the
soreness thereof.

18:16 Nevertheless, I did look unto my God, and I did praise him all
the day long; and I did not murmur against the Lord <368 of mine
afflictions.

18:17 Now my father, Lehi, had said many <512 unto <98 and also
unto the sons of Ishmael; but, <477 they did breathe out much
threatenings <39 anyone that <110 <385 for me; and my parents
being stricken in years, and having suffered much grief <56 of
<126 children, they were <465 down, yea, even upon <9 sick-beds.

18:18 Because of <8 <22 and much sorrow, and the iniquity of my
brethren, they were <27 near even to be carried out of this time to
meet <27 God; yea, <3 grey hairs were <232 to be <23 down to
lie low in the dust; yea, even they were near to be cast with sorrow
into a watery grave.

18:19 And Jacob and Joseph also, <99 young, <96 need of much
nourishment, were grieved <100 of the afflictions of <55 mother;
and also my wife with her tears and prayers, and also my <116 did
not soften the hearts of my <277 that they would <348 me.

18:20 And <402 was nothing save it were the power of God, <261
threatened them with destruction, <452 <33 <53 hearts; <281
when they saw that they were <114 to be <346 up in the <345 of
the sea they repented of the thing <35 they had done, <453 that
they <308 me.

18:21 And it came to pass <369 they had <14 me, <237 I took the
<506 and it did work <490 I desired it. And it came to pass that
I prayed unto the Lord; and <32 I had <8 the winds did cease, and
the storm did <6 and <111 was a <345 calm.

18:22 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did guide the ship, that we
sailed again towards the promised land.

18:23 And it came to pass that <55 we had <19 for the <450 of
many days we did arrive at the <28 land; and we went forth upon
the land, and did pitch our tents; and we did call it the <21
<50

18:24 And it came to pass that we did begin to till the earth, and we
<498 to plant seeds; yea, we did put all our seeds into the <17
<181 we had <312 from the land of Jerusalem. And it came to pass
that they did grow <485 <226 we were blessed in
abundance.

18:25 And it came to pass that we did find upon the land of promise, as
we journeyed in the wilderness, that <168 were beasts in the forests
of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and the ass and the horse, and
the goat and the wild goat, and all manner of wild animals, <89 were
for the use of men. And we did find all <17 of ore, both of gold,
and of silver, and of copper.

1 Nephi Chapter 19

19:1 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I did
make plates of ore that I might engraven upon them the record of my
people. And upon the <18 <71 I made I did <18 the <16 of
my father, and also our journeyings in the <127 and the
prophecies of my father; and also many of mine own <10 have I
<31 upon them.

19:2 And I knew not at the time when I made them that I should be
<85 of the Lord to make these plates; <207 the <62 of my
<62 and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more part of all our
proceedings in the wilderness are <57 upon those first <98 of
<100 I have spoken; <37 the things <7 transpired before I
made <48 <17 are, of a truth, more particularly made mention upon
the <30 plates.

19:3 And <368 I had made <24 <24 by way of commandment, I, <403
received a commandment that the ministry and the prophecies, the more
plain and precious parts of them, <108 be written upon <31 <103
and that the <68 <68 were <11 <14 be kept for the
instruction of my people, who <11 possess the <402 and also for
other wise purposes, <25 purposes are known unto the Lord.

19:4 Wherefore, I, <69 did make a <148 upon the <23 plates,
<23 gives an account, or <5 <5 a greater account of the wars
and contentions and destructions of my <248 And this have I done,
and <192 my people what they <67 do <125 I was gone; and that
<97 <128 <11 be handed down from one generation to another, or
from one prophet to <7 until further commandments of the <82

19:5 And an <63 of my making <34 <34 shall be given hereafter;
and then, behold, I proceed according to that <86 I have <214 and
this I do that the more sacred <153 may be kept for the knowledge of
my <94

19:6 Nevertheless, I do not write anything upon <49 save it be that
I think it be sacred. And now, if I do err, even did they err of old;
not that I would excuse myself because of <161 men, but <5 of the
weakness <75 is in me, <82 to the flesh, I <22 <22 myself.

19:7 For the <80 <19 some men esteem to be of great worth, both to
the body and soul, others set at naught and trample under their feet.
Yea, even the very God of Israel do men <14 <14 <14 feet; I
say, <7 <7 <7 feet but I <58 speak in <78 words—they set
him at naught, and hearken not to the voice of his counsels.

19:8 And behold he cometh, <90 to the words of the angel, in six
hundred years from the time my father left Jerusalem.

19:9 And the world, <125 of <59 iniquity, <212 judge him to be a
thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and
they smite him, and he <9 it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he
<10 it, <41 of his loving kindness and his long-suffering
towards the children of men.

19:10 And the God of our <494 who were led out of Egypt, out of
bondage, and also were preserved in the <499 by him, yea, the God
of Abraham, and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, yieldeth himself,
<127 to the <127 of the <127 as a man, into the hands of wicked
men, to be lifted up, <21 to the <21 of Zenock, and to be
crucified, <11 to the <11 of Neum, and to be buried in a
sepulchre, <14 to the <14 of Zenos, <254 he spake concerning
the three days of darkness, <10 <406 be a sign <374 of his death
unto those who <12 inhabit the isles of the sea, more especially
<18 unto <14 who are of the house of Israel.

19:11 For thus <47 the prophet: The Lord God surely <205 visit all
the <21 of <285 at that day, some with his voice, <183 of <224
righteousness, unto <4 <325 joy and salvation, and <321 with the
thunderings and the lightnings of his power, by tempest, by fire, and
by smoke, and vapor of <96 and by the opening of the earth, and
by mountains <107 <62 be carried up.

19:12 And all <491 <384 must <76 come, saith the prophet Zenos.
And the rocks of the earth must rend; and <76 of the groanings of
the <42 many of the kings of the <135 of the sea <47 be wrought
upon by the Spirit of God, to exclaim: The God of nature suffers.

19:13 And as for <154 who are at Jerusalem, <61 the prophet, they
<34 be scourged by all people, <58 they crucify the God of
Israel, and turn <138 hearts aside, rejecting signs and wonders, and
the power and glory of the God of <190

19:14 And <33 they turn <26 <26 <26 <50 the <50 and
have despised the Holy One of <43 they <58 wander in the flesh,
and perish, and become a hiss and a byword, and be hated among all
nations.

19:15 Nevertheless, when that day <467 <44 the <44 that they
no more turn aside <57 <57 against the Holy One of <50 then
will he remember the covenants <196 he made to <19 fathers.

19:16 Yea, then will he <17 the <168 of the sea; yea, and all the
people who are of the <282 of <40 will I gather in, <62 the
Lord, <360 to the <360 of the <225 <362 from the four
quarters of the earth.

19:17 Yea, and all the <235 <122 see the salvation of the <32 <36
the prophet; every nation, kindred, tongue and <57 <17 be blessed.

19:18 And I, Nephi, have written <280 <280 unto my <208 that
perhaps I might persuade them that they would <96 the Lord <109
Redeemer.

19:19 Wherefore, I speak unto all the <96 of <96 if it so be that
they <426 obtain <43 things.

19:20 For behold, I have workings in the spirit, <152 doth weary me
even that all my joints are weak, for <289 who are at Jerusalem; for
had not the Lord been merciful, to show unto me <492 them, even
as he had prophets of old, I <57 have perished also.

19:21 And he <385 did show unto the <19 of old all <116
<32 them; and also he did show unto many <9 us;
wherefore, it must needs be that we know <11 them for they are
<146 upon the plates of brass.

19:22 Now it came to pass that I, <165 did teach my brethren <124
things; and it came to pass that I did read many <63 to <94 <126
were engraven upon the <41 of brass, that they <185 know <57
the doings of the Lord in other lands, <339 <220 of old.

19:23 And I did read many <39 unto them <39 were <79 in the
books of Moses; but that I <40 more fully <227 them to believe in
the Lord <227 Redeemer I did read unto them that <31 was <31 by
the <307 Isaiah; for I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it
<38 be for our profit and learning.

19:24 Wherefore I spake unto <105 saying: Hear ye the <343 of the
<414 ye who are a remnant of the <273 of <273 a branch who have
been broken off; hear ye the <26 of the <25 <69 were <69
unto all the <25 of <25 and <69 them unto yourselves, that ye
may have hope as well as your <181 from whom ye have been <40
off; for after this manner has the <103 written.

1 Nephi Chapter 20

20:1 Hearken and hear this, O <51 of Jacob, who are called by the
name of <60 and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, or out
of the <8 of baptism, who swear by the name of the <440 and make
mention of the God of <35 yet they <18 not in truth nor in
righteousness.

20:2 Nevertheless, they call themselves of the holy city, but they do
not stay <11 upon the God of <34 who is the Lord of Hosts;
yea, the Lord of Hosts is his name.

20:3 Behold, I have declared the former <267 from the beginning; and
they went <99 out of my mouth, and I showed them. I did show them
suddenly.

20:4 And I did it because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck
is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;

20:5 And I have even from the beginning <64 to thee; before it
came to pass I <56 them <10 and I <5 them for fear lest thou
shouldst say—mine idol hath done <287 and my graven image, and my
molten image hath commanded <84

20:6 Thou hast seen and heard all this; and will ye not declare them?
And that I have <47 thee new <126 from this time, even hidden
things, and thou didst not know <39

20:7 They are created now, and not from the beginning, even <90 the
day when thou heardest them not they were <104 unto thee, lest thou
<88 say—Behold I knew <36

20:8 Yea, and thou <23 not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that
time thine ear was not opened; for I knew that thou wouldst deal very
treacherously, and wast <312 a transgressor from the womb.

20:9 <266 for my name’s sake will I defer mine anger, and for
my praise will I refrain from <73 that I cut thee not off.

20:10 For, behold, I have refined <16 I have chosen thee in the
furnace of affliction.

20:11 For mine own sake, yea, for mine own sake will I do <391 for I
will not suffer my name to be polluted, and I will not give my glory
unto another.

20:12 <420 unto me, O <417 and Israel my called, for I am he; I am
the first, and I am also the last.

20:13 Mine hand hath also laid the foundation of the earth, and my
right hand hath spanned the heavens. I call unto them and they stand up
together.

20:14 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; who among them hath
<216 these <257 unto <268 The Lord hath loved him; yea, and he
will fulfill his word which he hath <21 by them; and he will do
his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall come upon the Chaldeans.

20:15 Also, saith the Lord; I the <501 yea, I have spoken; yea, I have
<230 him to declare, I have brought him, and he <34 make his way
prosperous.

20:16 Come ye near unto me; I have not spoken in secret; from the
<323 from the time that it was <80 have I <49 and the
Lord God, and his Spirit, hath sent me.

20:17 And thus <76 the <73 thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I
have sent him, the Lord thy God who teacheth thee to profit, who
leadeth thee by the way thou <364 go, hath done it.

20:18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments—then had thy peace
been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea.

20:19 Thy seed also had been as the sand; the offspring of thy bowels
like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor
destroyed from <449 me.

20:20 Go ye forth of <200 flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice
of singing <509 ye, tell <345 utter to the end of the earth; say
ye: The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob.

20:21 And they thirsted not; he led them through the deserts; he caused
the waters to flow out of the rock for <268 he clave the rock also and
the <17 gushed out.

20:22 And notwithstanding he hath done all <66 and greater also,
there is no peace, <200 the <200 unto the wicked.

1 Nephi Chapter 21

21:1 And again: Hearken, O ye house of Israel, all ye that are broken
off and are driven out because of the wickedness of the pastors of my
people; yea, all ye that are <23 off, that are scattered abroad, who
are of my people, O <43 of Israel. Listen, O isles, unto me, and
hearken ye people from far; the Lord hath <345 me from the womb; from
the <209 of my mother hath he made mention of my name.

21:2 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his
hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath
he hid me;

21:3 And said unto me: Thou art my servant, O <130 in whom I will be
glorified.

21:4 Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for
naught and in vain; surely my judgment is with the <189 and my work
with my God.

21:5 And now, <205 the Lord—that formed me from the womb that I <325
be his <67 to bring Jacob again to him—though Israel be not
gathered, yet <484 I be glorious in the eyes of the <50 and my God
<14 be my strength.

21:6 And he said: It is a light thing that thou <432 be my <326
to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of
<216 I will also give thee for a <31 to the Gentiles, that thou
mayest be my salvation unto the ends of the earth.

21:7 Thus <108 the <74 the Redeemer of <165 his Holy One, to him
whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to <69 of
rulers: Kings <95 see and arise, princes also <6 worship, <313
of the Lord that is faithful.

21:8 Thus <49 the Lord: In an acceptable time have I heard thee, O
isles of the sea, and in a day of <83 have I helped thee; and I
will preserve <22 and give thee my <63 for a covenant of the
<343 to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate
heritages;

21:9 That thou <127 say to the prisoners: Go forth; to them that sit
in darkness: Show yourselves. They <95 feed in the ways, and their
pastures <9 be in all high places.

21:10 They <11 not hunger nor thirst, neither <6 the heat nor the
sun smite <507 for he that hath mercy on them <16 lead them, even by
the springs of water <10 he guide them.

21:11 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways <20 be
exalted.

21:12 And then, O <460 of <208 behold, these <16 come from far;
and lo, <8 from the north and from the west; and <9 from the land
of Sinim.

21:13 Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; for the feet of those
who are in the east <46 be established; and break forth into singing,
O mountains; for they <13 be smitten no more; for the Lord hath
comforted his <195 and will have <124 upon his afflicted.

21:14 But, <86 Zion hath <361 The Lord hath forsaken me, and my
Lord hath forgotten me—but he will show that he hath not.

21:15 For can a woman forget her sucking child, that she <436 not
have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will
I not <26 <278 O <149 of <393

21:16 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls
are continually before me.

21:17 Thy children <116 make haste against thy destroyers; and they
that made thee waste <13 go <139 of thee.

21:18 Lift up thine eyes round about and behold; all <190 gather
themselves together, and they <25 come to <24 And as I live, <389
the <439 thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an
ornament, and bind them on even as a bride.

21:19 For thy <65 and thy <369 places, and the land of thy
destruction, <51 even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants;
and they that swallowed thee up <18 be far away.

21:20 The <117 whom thou <68 have, after thou hast lost the
first, <21 again in <107 ears say: The place is too strait for me;
give <8 to me that I may dwell.

21:21 Then <36 thou say in <28 heart: Who hath begotten me these,
seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and
removing to and fro? And who hath brought up these? <214 I was left
alone; <31 where have they been?

21:22 Thus <160 the Lord God: <20 I will lift up mine hand to the
Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people; and they <103 bring
thy sons in <494 arms, and thy daughters <11 be carried upon <9
shoulders.

21:23 And kings <13 be thy nursing fathers, and <15 queens thy
<7 mothers; they <13 bow down to thee with <13 face towards
the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou <135 know that I
am the Lord; for they <32 not be ashamed that wait for me.

21:24 For <13 the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful
captives delivered?

21:25 But thus <127 the <286 even the <13 of the mighty <29 be
<28 away, and the prey of the terrible <11 be delivered; for I will
contend with him that contendeth with <399 and I will save thy
children.

21:26 And I will feed them that oppress thee with <113 own flesh; they
<39 be drunken with <9 own blood as with sweet wine; and all flesh
<15 know that I, the <77 am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the Mighty
One of Jacob.

1 Nephi Chapter 22

22:1 And now it came to pass that <322 I, Nephi, had read <417 things
which were engraven upon the plates of brass, my brethren came unto me
and said unto me: What meaneth <23 <23 <22 ye have read? <267
are they to be understood according to <14 <14 are spiritual,
<4 <85 come to pass <12 to the spirit and not the flesh?

22:2 And I, <65 said unto them: Behold they were manifest unto the
prophet by the voice of the Spirit; for by the Spirit are all <48
made known unto the prophets, <50 <50 come upon the <430 of men
<54 to the flesh.

22:3 Wherefore, the <26 of <21 I have read are <7 pertaining
to <4 both temporal and spiritual; for it appears that the house of
Israel, sooner or later, will be scattered upon all the face of the
<319 and also among all nations.

22:4 And behold, there are many who are already lost from the knowledge
of those who are at Jerusalem. Yea, the more part of all the tribes
have been led away; and they are <53 to and fro upon the isles of
the sea; and whither they are none of us knoweth, save that we know
that they have been led away.

22:5 And since they have been led <337 <213 <114 have been
prophesied concerning them, and also <4 all <74 who <156
hereafter be <59 and be confounded, because of the Holy One of
Israel; for against him will they harden <324 hearts; wherefore, they
<27 be <25 <127 all nations and <7 be hated of all men.

22:6 Nevertheless, <300 they <13 be nursed by the Gentiles, and the
Lord has lifted up his hand upon the Gentiles and set them up for a
standard, and <52 <227 have been carried in <6 arms, and <3
daughters have been <10 upon <7 shoulders, behold <107 <107
of <233 are spoken are temporal; for thus are the covenants of the
Lord with our fathers; and it <344 us in the days to come, and also
all our <366 who are of the <250 of Israel.

22:7 And it <26 that the time cometh that <103 all the <18 of
Israel have been <128 and <152 that the Lord God will raise
up a mighty nation <141 the <121 yea, even upon the face of this
land; and by them <139 our seed be scattered.

22:8 And <48 our seed is <43 the Lord God will proceed to do a
marvelous work <41 the <41 <118 <30 be of great worth unto
our seed; <201 it is likened unto <140 being nourished by the
<172 and <7 <151 in <11 arms and upon <4 shoulders.

22:9 And it <37 also be of <37 unto the Gentiles; and not only unto
the <31 but unto all the <121 of <388 unto the making <439 of
the <176 of the Father of heaven unto Abraham, saying: In thy seed
<42 all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.

22:10 And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the
<23 of the <23 cannot be blessed unless he <35 make bare his
arm in the eyes of the <436

22:11 <486 the Lord God will <146 to make bare his arm in the
eyes of all the nations, in bringing about his <87 and his gospel
unto <377 who are of the <108 of <247

22:12 <41 he will bring them again out of captivity, and they
<69 be gathered together to the lands of <162 inheritance; and they
<13 be brought out of obscurity and out of darkness; and they <12
know that the Lord is <24 Savior and <3 Redeemer, the Mighty One
of <59

22:13 And the blood of that <232 and abominable church, <240 is the
whore of all the earth, <40 turn upon <33 own heads; for they <8
war <263 themselves, and the sword of <14 own hands <12 fall upon
<7 own heads, and they <9 be drunken with <9 own blood.

22:14 And every <336 <52 <15 war <493 thee, O <133 of <241
<9 be turned one <11 another, and they <8 fall into the pit
<24 they digged to ensnare the people of the Lord. And all that fight
<25 Zion <23 be destroyed, and that <102 whore, who hath
perverted the right ways of the Lord, yea, that <14 and <116
<117 <24 tumble to the dust and <11 <7 be the fall of it.

22:15 For behold, saith the prophet, the time <450 speedily that
Satan <22 have no more power over the hearts of the children of men;
for the day soon <23 that all the proud and they who do wickedly
<29 be as stubble; and the day <18 that they must be burned.

22:16 For the time soon <14 that the fulness of the wrath of God
<31 be poured out upon all the <57 of men; for he will not
suffer that the wicked <19 destroy the righteous.

22:17 <301 he will preserve the righteous by his power, even if
it so be that the <51 of his <51 must come, and the <20 be
preserved, even unto the destruction of <225 enemies by fire.
<39 the <16 need not fear; for thus <144 the <144
they <60 be saved, even if it so be as by <25

22:18 Behold, my <445 I say unto you, that these things must
shortly come; yea, even blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke must <11
and it must needs be upon the face of this earth; and it <143 unto
men according to the flesh if it so be that they will harden <88
<204 <267 the Holy One of <377

22:19 For <234 the <97 <87 not perish; for the time surely
must come that all they who <297 <29 Zion <17 be cut off.

22:20 And the Lord will <23 prepare a way for his people, unto the
fulfilling of the words of Moses, <341 he spake, saying: A prophet
<35 the Lord your God raise up unto you, like unto me; him <13 ye
hear in all <134 whatsoever he <9 say unto you. And it <6 come
to pass that all those who will not hear that <43 <14 be cut off
from <452 the people.

22:21 And now I, Nephi, declare unto you, that this <23 of whom
Moses spake was the Holy One of Israel; wherefore, he <36 execute
judgment in righteousness.

22:22 And the <143 need not fear, for they are <62 who <21 not
be confounded. But it is the kingdom of the devil, <119 <14 be built
up <70 the <331 of men, <11 <16 is established <9 them
<7 are in the flesh—

22:23 For the time <424 <30 come that all churches <18 are
<36 up to get gain, and all <61 who are <10 up to get <439 over
the flesh, and <13 who are <13 up to become popular in the eyes of
the world, and <16 who seek the lusts of the <272 and the <178 of
the <16 and to do all manner of iniquity; yea, in fine, all <26
who belong to the <95 of the devil are they who need <134 and
tremble, and quake; they are <22 who must be brought low in the dust;
they are <12 who must be consumed as <499 and this is <338
to the <271 of the prophet.

22:24 And the time <357 <131 that the <186 must be led up as
calves of the stall, and the Holy One of Israel must reign in dominion,
and might, and <484 and great glory.

22:25 And he gathereth his <193 from the four quarters of the
<409 and he numbereth his sheep, and they know him; and there <190
be one fold and one shepherd; and he <10 feed his <20 and in him
they <9 find pasture.

22:26 And because of the righteousness of his <383 Satan has no
power; <296 he cannot be loosed for the space of many years; for
he hath no <223 over the <458 of the <28 for they dwell in
righteousness, and the Holy One of <114 reigneth.

22:27 And now <469 I, <358 say unto you that all these <226 must
come <170 to the flesh.

22:28 But, <22 all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people <91
<48 safely in the Holy One of <46 if it so be that they will
repent.

22:29 And now I, <53 make an end; for I durst not speak further as
yet concerning <61 things.

22:30 Wherefore, my brethren, I would that ye should consider that the
<78 <354 have been written upon the plates of brass are true; and
they testify that a man must be obedient to the commandments of God.

22:31 <43 ye need not suppose that I and my father are the only
ones that have testified, and also taught them. <22 if ye <114
be <38 to the commandments, and endure to the end, ye <13 be
saved at the last day. And thus it is. Amen.




 THE SECOND BOOK OF NEPHI


An account of the death of Lehi. Nephi’s brethren rebel against him.
The Lord warns Nephi to depart into the wilderness. His journeyings in
the wilderness, and so forth.

2 <19 Chapter 1

1:1 And now it came to pass that after I, <185 had made an end of
teaching my <172 our father, Lehi, also spake many <169 unto
them, and rehearsed unto <4 how <376 <10 the Lord had done for
them in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem.

1:2 And he <35 unto them <224 their rebellions upon the waters,
and the mercies of God in sparing <13 lives, that they were not
swallowed up in the sea.

1:3 And he also <36 unto them <36 the land of promise, <245
they had obtained—how merciful the Lord had been in warning us that we
<267 flee out of the land of <74

1:4 For, <340 said he, I have seen a vision, in <38 I know that
Jerusalem is destroyed; and had we remained in <8 we <37 also
have perished.

1:5 But, said he, notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a
land of <76 a land <40 is choice above all other lands; a land
<10 the Lord God hath covenanted with me <43 be a land for the
inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath <18 this land unto
me, and to my children forever, and also all those who <31 be led
out of <50 countries by the hand of the Lord.

1:6 <338 I, <228 prophesy <469 to the workings of the
Spirit <69 is in me, that there <340 none come into this land save
they <9 be brought by the hand of the <40

1:7 <40 this land is consecrated unto him whom he <22 bring.
And if it so be that they <10 serve him <58 to the <432
<55 he hath given, it <13 be a land of liberty unto them;
wherefore, they <11 never be <57 down into captivity; if so, it
<11 be because of iniquity; for if iniquity <8 abound cursed <3
be the land for <283 sakes, but unto the righteous it <13 be blessed
forever.

1:8 And <244 it is wisdom that this land <153 be kept as yet from
the knowledge of <157 nations; for <20 many nations would overrun
the land, that <140 <7 be no place for an inheritance.

1:9 <129 I, <169 have <248 a <245 that inasmuch as <199
whom the Lord God <67 bring out of the land of <286 <8 keep
his commandments, they <6 prosper upon the face of this land; and
they <11 be kept from all <70 nations, that they may possess this
land unto themselves. And if it so be that they <23 keep his
<172 they <6 be <121 upon the face of this <92 and
<93 <12 be none to molest <471 nor to take away the land of <153
inheritance; and they <18 dwell safely <150

1:10 But <130 when the time cometh that they <16 dwindle in
unbelief, after they have received so <508 blessings from the hand of
the Lord—having a <162 of the creation of the earth, and all men,
knowing the <23 and marvelous works of the Lord from the <19 of
the world; having power given them to do all things by faith; <10
all the <109 from the beginning, and <9 been <267 by his
infinite goodness into this precious land of promise—behold, I say, if
the day <86 come that they will reject the Holy One of Israel, the
true Messiah, <122 Redeemer and <3 God, <113 the judgments of
him that is just <29 rest upon them.

1:11 Yea, he will <225 <197 <263 unto <159 and he will give unto
them power, and he will take away from them the lands of <45
possessions, and he will cause them to be scattered and smitten.

1:12 Yea, as one generation passeth to another <208 <59 be
bloodsheds, and <146 visitations among <388 <387 my sons, I
<315 that ye <3 remember; yea, I <4 that ye <3 hearken unto
my words.

1:13 O that ye <13 awake; awake from a deep sleep, yea, even from the
sleep of hell, and shake off the awful chains by <451 ye are bound,
<5 are the <10 <4 bind the children of men, that they are
carried away captive down to the eternal gulf of misery and woe.

1:14 Awake! and arise from the dust, and hear the words of a trembling
parent, whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent grave,
from whence no traveler can return; a few more days and I go the way of
all the earth.

1:15 But <216 the Lord hath redeemed my soul from hell; I have
beheld his glory, and I am encircled about eternally in the arms of his
love.

1:16 And I desire that ye <509 remember to observe the statutes and
the <260 of the Lord; <50 this hath been the anxiety of my
soul from the beginning.

1:17 My heart hath been weighed down with sorrow from time to time, for
I have feared, lest for the hardness of your hearts the Lord your God
<59 come out in the fulness of his wrath upon you, that ye be cut
off and destroyed forever;

1:18 Or, that a cursing <28 come upon you for the space of many
generations; and ye are visited by sword, and by famine, and are hated,
and are led according to the will and captivity of the devil.

1:19 O my <303 that these <437 might not come upon you, but that ye
<9 be a choice and a favored people of the Lord. But <141 his
will be done; for his ways are righteousness forever.

1:20 And he hath said that: Inasmuch as ye <363 keep my <479
ye <6 prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my
<17 ye <16 be cut off from my presence.

1:21 And now that my soul <74 have joy in you, and that my <193
<10 leave this world with gladness because of you, that I <11 not
be brought down with grief and <209 to the <313 <339 from the
<340 my <127 and be men, and be determined in one mind and in one
heart, united in all things, that ye may not come down into captivity;

1:22 That ye may not be cursed with a sore cursing; and also, that ye
may not incur the displeasure of a just God upon you, unto the
destruction, yea, the <420 destruction of both soul and body.

1:23 Awake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off the
<461 with <462 ye are <471 and come forth out of obscurity, and
<107 from the dust.

1:24 Rebel no more against your brother, <447 views have been
glorious, and who hath kept the <184 from the time that we left
Jerusalem; and who hath been an instrument in the hands of God, in
bringing us <55 into the land of promise; for were it not for him, we
must have perished with hunger in the wilderness; nevertheless, ye
sought to take away his life; yea, and he hath suffered much <197
<213 of you.

1:25 And I exceedingly fear and tremble <13 of you, lest he <263
suffer again; for <314 ye have accused him that he <44 power and
authority over you; but I know that he hath not <14 for <15 nor
<15 over you, but he hath <11 the glory of God, and your own
<190 welfare.

1:26 And ye have murmured <61 he hath been plain unto you. Ye say
that he hath used sharpness; ye say that he hath been angry with you;
but <77 his sharpness was the <3 of the <62 of the word of
God, <215 was in him; and that <6 ye call anger was the truth,
<460 to that <11 is in God, <4 he could not restrain,
manifesting boldly concerning your iniquities.

1:27 And it must needs be that the <50 of God must be with him, even
unto his commanding you that ye must obey. But <76 it was not he,
but it was the Spirit of the Lord <54 was in him, <4 opened his
mouth to utterance that he <65 not shut it.

1:28 And now my son, Laman, and also Lemuel and Sam, and also my sons
who are the sons of Ishmael, <56 if ye will hearken unto the voice
of Nephi ye <226 not perish. And if ye will <15 unto him I <473
unto you a blessing, yea, even my first blessing.

1:29 But if ye will not <24 unto him I take away my <18 <23
yea, even my <5 and it <47 rest upon him.

1:30 And now Zoram, I speak unto you: Behold, thou art the servant of
Laban; <331 thou hast been brought out of the land of
Jerusalem, and I know that thou art a true friend unto my son, Nephi,
forever.

1:31 Wherefore, <272 thou hast been faithful thy seed <62 be
blessed with his seed, that they dwell in prosperity long upon the face
of this land; and nothing, save it <24 be iniquity among them, <5
harm or disturb their <24 upon the face of this land <55

1:32 <55 if ye <21 keep the <469 of the Lord, the Lord
hath consecrated this land for the security of thy seed with the seed
of my son.

2 <192 Chapter 2

2:1 And now, Jacob, I <142 unto you: Thou art my first-born in the
days of my tribulation in the wilderness. And <231 in thy childhood
thou hast <474 afflictions and much sorrow, <129 of the rudeness
of thy brethren.

2:2 Nevertheless, <45 my <39 in the wilderness, thou knowest
the greatness of God; and he <100 consecrate thine <35 for thy
gain.

2:3 <115 thy soul <15 be blessed, and thou shalt <162 safely
with thy brother, Nephi; and thy days <16 be spent in the service of
thy God. <29 I know that thou art redeemed, <76 of the
righteousness of thy Redeemer; for thou hast beheld that in the fulness
of time he cometh to bring salvation unto men.

2:4 And thou hast <22 in thy youth his glory; wherefore, thou art
<238 even as they unto whom he <67 minister in the flesh; for the
<423 is the same, yesterday, today, and <221 And the way is
prepared from the fall of man, and <55 is free.

2:5 And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil.
And the law is given unto men. And by the law no flesh is justified;
or, by the law men are cut off. Yea, by the temporal law they were cut
off; and also, by the spiritual law they perish from that <498 is
good, and become miserable <83

2:6 <160 redemption <135 in and through the Holy Messiah; for
he is full of grace and truth.

2:7 <420 he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends
of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite
spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.

2:8 <67 how great the importance to make these things known unto
the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is no <136
that can <276 in the presence of God, save it be <100 the merits,
and mercy, and <97 of the Holy Messiah, who layeth down his life
according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit,
that he may <272 to pass the resurrection of the dead, being the first
that should rise.

2:9 <93 he is the first-fruits unto God, inasmuch as he <273
make intercession for all the children of men; and they that believe in
him <17 be saved.

2:10 And <348 of the <25 for all, all men come unto God;
<321 they stand in the <113 of him to be judged of him
<98 to the truth and holiness <239 is in him. <71 the
ends of the law <11 the Holy One hath given, unto the inflicting of
the punishment <13 is affixed, <3 <5 that is affixed is in
opposition to that of the happiness <14 is <17 to <241 the
ends of the atonement—

2:11 For it must needs be, that <200 is an <30 in all things.
If not so, my first-born in the wilderness, <454 could not be
brought to pass, neither wickedness, <2 <90 nor misery,
<5 good nor bad. <93 all <251 must <42 be a compound in
one; <128 if it <184 be one body it must <16 remain as <199
having no life <32 death, nor corruption nor incorruption,
<92 nor <43 <10 sense nor insensibility.

2:12 <46 it must <29 have been created for a thing of naught;
wherefore <95 would have been no purpose in the end of its creation.
<27 this <20 must <28 destroy the wisdom of God and his
eternal purposes, and also the power, and the <308 and the justice of
God.

2:13 And if ye <245 say <50 is no law, ye <7 also say <8 is no
sin. If ye <10 say <9 is no sin, ye <7 also say <8 is no
righteousness. And if <7 be no <164 <4 be no happiness.
And if <7 be no <11 nor <123 <6 be no <231
nor misery. And if <418 <167 are not <13 is no God. And if <6
is no God we are not, <148 the earth; for <12 <209 have been no
creation of things, <13 to act nor to be acted upon; <196 all
<41 must have vanished away.

2:14 And now, my sons, I speak unto you <59 <18 for your profit
and learning; for <46 is a God, and he hath <191 all <47 both
the heavens and the <493 and all <27 that in them are, both <6
to act and <5 to be <64 upon.

2:15 And to <460 about his <194 purposes in the end of man, after
he had <48 our <466 parents, and the beasts of the field and the
fowls of the air, and in fine, all <46 <369 are created, it must
<242 be that <86 was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in
<364 to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other
bitter.

2:16 <278 the Lord God gave unto man that he <346 act for
himself. <14 man <176 not act for himself save it <14 be
that he was enticed by the one or the other.

2:17 And I, Lehi, <497 to the <85 <85 I have read, must <84
suppose that an angel of God, <17 to that <16 is written, had
fallen from heaven; <215 he became a devil, <402 sought that
<17 was evil before God.

2:18 And because he had <25 from heaven, and had become miserable
forever, he <26 also the misery of all mankind. <96 he said
unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent, who is the <49 who is the
father of all lies, <425 he said: Partake of the <162 fruit,
and ye <363 not die, but ye <5 be as God, knowing good and evil.

2:19 And <226 Adam and Eve had partaken of the <31 <193 they
were driven out of the garden of Eden, to till the earth.

2:20 And they have brought forth children; yea, even the family of all
the <19

2:21 And the days of the children of men were prolonged, <159 to
the will of God, that they might repent while in the flesh; <163
their state <165 a <3 of probation, and <8 time was lengthened,
<30 to the commandments <173 the Lord God gave unto the <46
of men. For he gave commandment that all men must repent; for he showed
unto all men that they were lost, <194 of the transgression of <45
parents.

2:22 And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have
fallen, but he <7 have remained in the <138 of Eden. And all
<277 <71 were <386 must have <15 in the same <93 in <11
they were <177 they were created; and they must have <18 <247
and had no end.

2:23 And they <48 have had no <169 <232 they <7 have
<23 in a <40 of innocence, <300 no joy, for they knew no
misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.

2:24 But <100 all <77 have been done in the wisdom of him who
knoweth all things.

2:25 Adam fell that men <194 be; and men are, that they <7 have
joy.

2:26 And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem
the <192 of men from the fall. And <175 that they are redeemed
from the fall they have <372 free <124 <320 good from evil; to
act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the
punishment of the law at the great and last day, <255 to the
<256 <174 God hath given.

2:27 <407 men are free <17 to the <291 and all <127 are
given them <23 are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose
liberty and eternal life, through the <50 Mediator of all men, or to
<16 captivity and death, <41 to the <6 and power of the
devil; for he seeketh that all men <149 be <481 like unto
himself.

2:28 And now, my sons, I <227 that ye should look to the <51
Mediator, and hearken unto his <7 commandments; and be faithful unto
his words, and <60 <73 <73 <59 to the will of his Holy
Spirit;

2:29 And not <18 <18 <77 <18 to the will of the flesh
and the evil <118 is therein, <3 giveth the spirit of the devil
<94 to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign over
you in his own kingdom.

2:30 I have spoken these few words unto you all, my <103 in the last
days of my probation; and I have chosen the good part, <72 to the
<25 of the prophet. And I have none other object save it be the
everlasting welfare of your souls. Amen.

2 Nephi Chapter 3

3:1 And now I speak unto you, Joseph, my last-born. Thou wast born in
the wilderness of mine afflictions; yea, in the days of my greatest
sorrow did thy mother bear thee.

3:2 And may the Lord consecrate also unto thee this land, <141 is a
most precious <7 for thine inheritance and the <3 of thy
seed with thy brethren, for thy security <345 if it so be that ye
shall keep the <320 of the Holy One of Israel.

3:3 And now, <88 my last-born, whom I have brought out of the
<90 of mine afflictions, may the Lord bless thee <44 for
thy seed <41 not utterly be destroyed.

3:4 For <478 thou art the fruit of my loins; and I am a descendant
of Joseph who was carried captive into Egypt. And <291 were the
covenants of the Lord <113 he made unto Joseph.

3:5 <399 <26 truly saw our day. And he obtained a promise of
the Lord, that out of the <55 of his loins the Lord God <348 raise
up a righteous branch unto the house of Israel; not the Messiah, but a
<12 <54 was to be broken off, nevertheless, to be remembered in
the <71 of the Lord that the Messiah <384 be made manifest unto
them in the latter days, in the <338 of power, unto the bringing of
them out of darkness unto light—yea, out of hidden <6 and out of
<451 unto freedom.

3:6 For <107 <107 testified, saying: A seer <164 the Lord my God
<93 up, who <9 be a choice seer unto the <111 of my loins.

3:7 Yea, <31 <31 said: Thus saith the Lord unto me: A <23 seer
will I <34 up out of the <29 of thy <195 and he <42 be esteemed
highly among the <13 of thy <42 And unto him will I give
commandment that he <21 do a work for the <20 of thy loins, his
<301 <154 <14 be of <220 worth unto them, even to the <127
of them to the knowledge of the <161 <21 I have made with thy
fathers.

3:8 And I will give unto him a <56 that he <42 do none <438
work, save the work <31 I <11 command him. And I will make him
<59 in mine eyes; for he <15 do my work.

3:9 And he <10 be <18 like unto Moses, whom I have said I <263
<137 up unto you, to deliver my people, O <265 of <384

3:10 And Moses will I <20 up, to <18 thy people out of the land
of <342

3:11 But a seer will I <22 up out of the <146 of thy <179 and unto
him will I give power to bring forth my word unto the seed of thy
loins—and not to the <155 <14 my word only, <227 the <358 but
to the convincing them of my word, <131 <105 have already gone <21
<219 them.

3:12 <395 the <59 of thy <378 <18 write; and the <8 of
the <9 of Judah <11 <11 and that <34 <5 be written by the
<18 of thy <231 and also that <14 <14 be <14 by the <13
of the <31 of Judah, <12 grow together, unto the confounding of
false doctrines and laying down of contentions, and establishing peace
<73 the <28 of thy <41 and <104 them to the <257 of
their fathers in the <406 <406 and also to the <13 of my
covenants, <121 the Lord.

3:13 And out of weakness he <60 be made strong, in that day when my
work <11 commence <54 all my <221 unto the restoring thee, O
<226 of Israel, <38 the <38

3:14 And thus prophesied Joseph, <429 Behold, that seer will the
Lord bless; and they that seek to destroy him <42 be confounded; for
this promise, <133 I have obtained of the <197 of the <108 of my
<109 <21 be fulfilled. <39 I am sure of the fulfilling of this
promise;

3:15 And his name <21 be called after me; and it <7 be <6 the
name of his father. And he <11 be like unto me; for the thing, <61
the Lord <12 <278 <243 by his hand, by the <287 of the Lord <12
<13 my <328 unto salvation.

3:16 Yea, thus <115 Joseph: I am sure of this <37 even as I am
sure of the promise of Moses; for the Lord hath said unto me, I will
preserve thy seed forever.

3:17 And the Lord hath said: I will <364 up a <29 and I will give
<70 unto him in a rod; and I will give judgment unto him in writing.
Yet I will not loose his tongue, that he <91 speak much, for I will
not make him mighty in speaking. But I will write unto him my law, by
the finger of mine own hand; and I will make a spokesman for him.

3:18 And the Lord said unto me also: I will <84 up unto the <213 of
thy <448 and I will make for him a spokesman. And I, behold, I will
give unto him that he <78 <63 the writing of the <30 of thy
<243 unto the <7 of thy <36 and the <63 of thy <391
<24 declare it.

3:19 And the words <219 he <12 <36 <2 be the <8 <8 are
expedient in my wisdom should go <230 unto the <41 of thy loins. And
it <23 be as if the <12 of thy <47 had cried unto them from the
dust; for I know <414 faith.

3:20 And they <28 cry from the <16 yea, even repentance unto <17
brethren, even <304 many generations have gone by them. And it <22
come to pass that <19 cry <8 go, even according to the simpleness
of <11 words.

3:21 Because of <8 faith <2 <98 <21 proceed <91 out of my
mouth unto <11 brethren who are the <88 of thy <141 and the
<469 of <14 <25 will I make strong in <7 faith, unto the
remembering of my covenant <137 I made unto thy fathers.

3:22 And now, <200 my son <464 <93 this manner did my father of
old prophesy.

3:23 Wherefore, because of this <35 thou art blessed; for thy seed
<81 not be destroyed, for they <6 hearken unto the <67 of the
book.

3:24 And there <15 rise up one <314 among them, who <8 do much
good, both in word and in deed, being an instrument in the hands of
God, with exceeding <101 to work <29 wonders, and do that thing
<103 is great in the sight of God, unto the bringing to pass much
restoration unto the house of Israel, and unto the seed of thy
brethren.

3:25 And now, blessed art thou, Joseph. Behold, thou art little;
wherefore <99 unto the <99 of thy brother, Nephi, and it <87 be
done unto thee even <222 to the <17 <66 I have spoken.
Remember the <8 of thy dying father. Amen.

2 Nephi Chapter 4

4:1 And now, I, <41 <453 concerning the prophecies of <33 my
<184 hath spoken, <10 <194 who was carried into Egypt.

4:2 For <208 he truly prophesied <16 all his seed. And the
<31 <30 he wrote, <173 are not many greater. And he
<20 <20 us, and our future generations; and they are
written upon the plates of brass.

4:3 <234 <249 my <62 had made an end of speaking <30
the <46 of <70 he called the children of Laman, his sons,
and his daughters, and said unto them: <154 my <11 and my
<11 who are the sons and the daughters of my first-born, I would
that ye <448 give ear unto my <373

4:4 For the Lord God hath said that: Inasmuch as ye <180 keep my
commandments ye <6 prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not
keep my <16 ye <16 be cut off from my presence.

4:5 But <152 my sons and my <75 I cannot go down to my grave
save I <70 leave a blessing upon you; for <23 I know that if ye
are brought up in the way ye <21 go ye will not depart from it.

4:6 <157 if ye are cursed, <31 I <39 my <39 upon you,
that the cursing may be taken from you and be answered upon the heads
of your parents.

4:7 <35 <426 of my <30 the Lord God will not suffer that
ye <110 perish; wherefore, he will be merciful unto you and unto your
seed forever.

4:8 And it came to pass that <230 my <230 had made an end of
<231 to the sons and <200 of <226 he caused the sons and
<9 of Lemuel to be <120 before him.

4:9 And he spake unto <465 saying: <240 my sons and my <164
who are the sons and the <31 of my second son; behold I <128
unto you the same <102 <331 I left unto the sons and <21 of
Laman; <102 thou shalt not utterly be destroyed; but in the end
thy seed <118 be blessed.

4:10 And it came to pass that when my <106 had made an end of
<106 unto <78 <187 he <83 unto the sons of Ishmael, yea, and
even all his household.

4:11 And <138 he had made an end of <30 unto <30 he <29 unto
Sam, <113 Blessed art <511 and thy seed; for thou <69 inherit the
land like unto thy brother Nephi. And thy seed <13 be numbered with
his <22 and thou <103 be even like unto thy brother, and thy seed
like unto his <17 and thou <17 be blessed in all thy days.

4:12 And it came to pass <79 my father, Lehi, had spoken unto all his
household, according to the feelings of his heart and the Spirit of the
Lord <174 was in him, he waxed old. And it came to pass that he died,
and was buried.

4:13 And it came to pass that not many days <57 his death, Laman and
<255 and the sons of Ishmael were angry with me <328 of the
admonitions of the Lord.

4:14 For I, Nephi, was constrained to speak unto <163 <83 to his
word; for I had <97 many things unto <13 and also my <108
<300 his death; many of <92 sayings are written upon mine other
plates; for a more history part are <12 upon mine <12 plates.

4:15 And upon these I write the <43 of my soul, and many of the
scriptures <40 are engraven upon the plates of brass. For my soul
delighteth in the scriptures, and my <158 pondereth <71 and writeth
them for the learning and the profit of my children.

4:16 <371 my soul <29 in the <54 of the Lord; and my <32
<33 continually upon the <12 <57 I have seen and heard.

4:17 Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in
showing me his <10 and marvelous works, my <35 exclaimeth: O
wretched man that I am! Yea, my <11 sorroweth <182 of my flesh; my
soul grieveth <8 of mine iniquities.

4:18 I am encompassed about, <12 of the temptations and the sins
<69 do so easily beset me.

4:19 And when I desire to rejoice, my <47 groaneth <27 of my
sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.

4:20 My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine
afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters
of the <110 deep.

4:21 He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my
flesh.

4:22 He hath confounded mine enemies, unto the causing of them to quake
<273 me.

4:23 <196 he hath heard my cry by day, and he hath given me
knowledge by visions in the nighttime.

4:24 And by day have I <390 bold in mighty prayer <40 him; yea, my
voice have I sent up on high; and angels came down and ministered unto
me.

4:25 And upon the wings of his <436 hath my body been carried away
upon exceedingly high mountains. And mine eyes have beheld <126
things, yea, even too <6 for man; therefore I was bidden that I
should not <346 them.

4:26 O then, if I have seen so <25 <30 if the Lord in his
condescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so much
mercy, why <38 my <229 weep and my soul linger in the valley of
sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength slacken, <248 of
mine afflictions?

4:27 And why <34 I yield to sin, <16 of my flesh? Yea, why
<12 I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my
<59 to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry <35
of mine enemy?

4:28 Awake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and
give <41 no more for the enemy of my soul.

4:29 Do not anger again <41 of mine enemies. Do not slacken my
<103 <10 of mine afflictions.

4:30 <42 O my <42 and cry unto the <437 and say: O <4 I
will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God,
and the rock of my salvation.

4:31 O <28 wilt thou redeem my <109 Wilt thou deliver me out of the
hands of mine enemies? Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the
appearance of sin?

4:32 May the gates of hell be shut continually <319 me, <94 that
my <162 is broken and my spirit is contrite! O <59 wilt thou not
shut the <28 of thy righteousness <26 me, that I may walk in the
path of the low valley, that I may be strict in the plain road!

4:33 O <39 wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy
righteousness! O <14 wilt thou make a way for mine escape <51 mine
enemies! Wilt thou make my path straight <10 me! Wilt thou not <211
a stumbling block in my way—but that thou wouldst clear my way <19
me, and hedge not up my way, but the ways of mine enemy.

4:34 O <58 I have trusted in <190 and I will trust in thee forever.
I will not put my <10 in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is
he that putteth his <17 in the arm of flesh. Yea, <14 is he that
<14 his <14 in man or maketh <382 his arm.

4:35 Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea,
my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; <474 I will lift up my
voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto <96 my God, the rock of my
righteousness. Behold, my <19 shall forever ascend up unto <17 my
rock and mine everlasting God. Amen.

2 Nephi Chapter 5

5:1 <28 it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cry much unto the Lord
my God, <279 of the <388 of my brethren.

5:2 But behold, their <11 did increase against me, insomuch that they
did seek to take away my life.

5:3 Yea, they did murmur <21 me, saying: Our younger brother thinks
to rule over us; and we have had much trial <56 of him; wherefore,
now let us slay him, that we may not be afflicted more <17 of his
words. For <67 we will not have him to be our ruler; for it belongs
unto us, who are the elder brethren, to rule over this people.

5:4 Now I do not write upon these plates all the words which they
murmured <86 me. But it sufficeth me to say, that they did seek to
take away my <112

5:5 And it came to pass that the Lord did warn me, that I, <169
should depart from them and flee into the wilderness, and all those who
would go with me.

5:6 Wherefore, it came to pass that I, <31 did take my family, and
also Zoram and his <7 and Sam, mine <107 <163 and his <8
and Jacob and Joseph, my <174 <118 and also my sisters, and all
<53 who <52 go with me. And all <8 who <8 go with me were
<8 who believed in the warnings and the revelations of God;
<194 they did hearken unto my <182

5:7 And we did take our tents and whatsoever things were possible for
us, and did journey in the wilderness for the space of many days. And
after we had journeyed for the <12 of many days we did pitch our
tents.

5:8 And my people <80 that we <157 call the name of the place
Nephi; <74 we did call it Nephi.

5:9 And all <98 who were with me did take upon them to call
themselves the <39 of <23

5:10 And we did observe to keep the judgments, and the statutes, and
the commandments of the Lord in all <108 according to the law of
Moses.

5:11 And the Lord was with us; and we did prosper exceedingly; for we
did sow seed, and we did reap again in abundance. And we began to raise
flocks, and herds, and animals of every kind.

5:12 And I, <246 had also brought the records <322 were engraven
upon the <332 of brass; and also the ball, or compass, <15 was
prepared for my father by the hand of the Lord, <89 to that <16
is written.

5:13 And it came to pass that we <70 to <89 exceedingly, and to
multiply in the land.

5:14 And I, <69 did take the sword of Laban, and <221 the manner of
it did make many swords, lest by any means the <175 who were now
called Lamanites <217 come upon us and destroy us; for I knew their
hatred towards me and my children and <215 who were <24 my <455

5:15 And I did teach my <41 to build buildings, and to work in all
<64 of wood, and of iron, and of copper, and of brass, and of steel,
and of gold, and of silver, and of precious ores, <132 were in great
<195

5:16 And I, <112 did <48 a temple; and I did construct it <114 the
<51 of the temple of Solomon save it were not built of so many
<42 things; for they were not to be found upon the land,
<331 it could not be <23 like unto Solomon’s temple. But the
<41 of the construction was like unto the <46 of Solomon; and the
workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine.

5:17 And it came to pass that I, <84 did cause my <136 to be
industrious, and to labor with <169 hands.

5:18 And it came to pass that they <412 that I <195 be <18 king.
But I, <36 was desirous that they <12 have no king; nevertheless,
I did for them <282 to that <150 was in my power.

5:19 And behold, the words of the Lord had been fulfilled unto my
brethren, <23 he spake concerning them, that I <43 be <55 ruler
and <4 teacher. Wherefore, I had been <6 <10 and <3 teacher,
<51 to the <432 of the <340 until the time they sought
to take away my life.

5:20 <32 the word of the Lord was <59 <55 he <55 unto
me, saying that: Inasmuch as they will not hearken unto thy <82 they
shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And <98 they were
cut off from his presence.

5:21 And he had caused the cursing to come upon <103 yea, even a sore
cursing, because of <94 iniquity. For <34 they had hardened <7
hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; <256
as they were white, and <233 fair and delightsome, that they
might not be enticing unto my <229 the Lord God did <236 a skin of
blackness to come upon them.

5:22 And thus saith the Lord God: I will <22 that they <112 be
loathsome unto thy people, save they <9 repent of <75 iniquities.

5:23 And cursed <11 be the seed of him that mixeth with <17 seed;
for they <14 be <17 even with the same cursing. And the Lord <174
it, and it was done.

5:24 And <129 of <30 <143 <192 was upon them they did <122
an idle <65 full of mischief and subtlety, and did seek in the
wilderness for beasts of prey.

5:25 And the Lord God said unto me: They <66 be a scourge unto thy
seed, to stir them up in remembrance of me; and inasmuch as they will
not remember me, and <244 unto my words, they <31 <29 them
even unto destruction.

5:26 And it came to pass that I, <376 did consecrate Jacob and
Joseph, that they <337 be priests and teachers over the land of my
people.

5:27 And it came to pass that we lived after the <477 of happiness.

5:28 And thirty years had passed away from the time we left Jerusalem.

5:29 And I, <60 had kept the records upon my plates, <156 I had
made, of my <254 thus far.

5:30 And it came to pass that the Lord God said unto me: Make other
plates; and thou shalt engraven many things upon them <38 are good in
my sight, for the profit of thy <98

5:31 <411 I, <65 to be obedient to the <438 of the
<439 went and made these plates upon <36 I have <44 <7
things.

5:32 And I engraved that <15 is pleasing unto God. And if my <90
are pleased with the <68 of God they will be <9 with mine
engravings <25 are upon <39 plates.

5:33 And if my <29 desire to know the more particular part of the
history of my <14 they must search mine <118 <28

5:34 And it sufficeth me to say that forty <183 had <183 away, and
we had already had wars and contentions with our brethren.

2 Nephi Chapter 6

6:1 The words of Jacob, the brother of <136 <80 he <368 unto the
<60 of Nephi:

6:2 Behold, my beloved brethren, I, <23 having been called of God,
and ordained <256 the <256 of his holy order, and <16 been
consecrated by my <44 <43 unto whom ye look as a king or a
protector, and on whom ye depend for safety, behold ye know that I have
spoken unto you exceedingly many <187

6:3 Nevertheless, I speak unto you again; for I am desirous for the
welfare of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety is great for you; and ye
yourselves know that it ever has been. For I have exhorted you with all
diligence; and I have taught you the <134 of my father; and I have
<67 unto you concerning all <231 <141 are written, from the
creation of the world.

6:4 And now, behold, I would <80 unto you <25 <24 <24
are, and <4 are to come; wherefore, I will read you the <52 of
Isaiah. And they are the <8 <19 my <149 has desired that I
<449 <37 unto you. And I <5 unto you for your sakes, that ye may
learn and glorify the name of your God.

6:5 And now, the <40 <40 I <510 read are they <6 Isaiah <234
<75 all the house of Israel; <71 they may be likened unto
you, for ye are of the <16 of Israel. And there are many <100 <31
have been <134 by <36 <7 may be <27 unto you, because ye
are of the <27 of <27

6:6 And now <370 are the words: Thus saith the Lord God: <289 I
will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the
people; and they <94 bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters
<11 be carried upon <10 shoulders.

6:7 And kings <12 be thy nursing fathers, and <14 queens thy
<7 mothers; they <13 bow down to thee with <13 faces towards
the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I
am the Lord; for they <32 not be ashamed that wait for me.

6:8 And now I, <389 <249 <207 somewhat <173 <119 words. For
<259 the Lord has shown me that those who were at Jerusalem, from
whence we came, have been slain and <100 away captive.

6:9 <366 the Lord has <28 unto me that they <257 return
again. And he also has <13 unto me that the Lord God, the Holy One of
Israel, <21 manifest himself unto them in the flesh; and <456 he
<12 <12 <12 they <4 scourge him and crucify him,
according to the <273 of the angel who <269 it unto me.

6:10 And <31 they have hardened <152 hearts and stiffened <4
necks against the Holy One of <57 <470 the judgments of the Holy
One of Israel <149 come upon them. And the day cometh that they <10
be smitten and afflicted.

6:11 Wherefore, <48 they are driven to and fro, for thus <273 the
angel, many <25 be afflicted in the flesh, and <7 not be suffered
to perish, <312 of the prayers of the faithful; they <15 be
scattered, and smitten, and hated; nevertheless, the Lord will be
merciful unto them, that when they <20 come to the knowledge of <102
Redeemer, they <10 be gathered together again to the lands of <13
inheritance.

6:12 And blessed are the <336 they of whom the prophet has
written; for <242 if it so be that they <37 repent and fight not
<146 Zion, and do not unite themselves to that great and abominable
church, they <21 be saved; for the Lord God will fulfil his covenants
<426 he has made unto his children; and for this cause the <57 has
written <302 things.

6:13 <159 they that <55 <53 Zion and the covenant people of
the Lord <48 lick up the dust of <103 <362 and the <15 of the
Lord <15 not be ashamed. For the <11 of the Lord are they who wait
for him; for they still wait for the coming of the Messiah.

6:14 And <123 <285 to the <285 of the prophet, the Messiah
will set <306 <163 the second time to recover them; wherefore, he
will <319 <13 unto them in power and <133 glory, unto the
destruction of <80 enemies, when that day <277 when they <79
believe in him; and none will he destroy that <9 in him.

6:15 And they that <10 not in him <25 be destroyed, both by fire,
and by tempest, and by earthquakes, and by bloodsheds, and by
pestilence, and by famine. And they <25 know that the Lord is God,
the Holy One of Israel.

6:16 For <18 the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive
delivered?

6:17 But thus <345 the Lord: Even the captives of the mighty <29 be
<28 away, and the prey of the terrible <11 be delivered; for the
Mighty God <8 deliver his <219 people. For thus <35 the <35
I will contend with them that contendeth with thee—

6:18 And I will feed them that oppress thee, with <157 own <498 and
they <39 be drunken with <10 own blood as with sweet wine; and all
flesh <15 know that I the Lord am thy Savior and thy <383 the
<70 One of Jacob.

2 Nephi Chapter 7

7:1 Yea, for thus <79 the <79 Have I put thee <108 or have I cast
thee off forever? For thus <18 the <18 Where is the bill of your
mother’s divorcement? To whom have I put thee <29 or to <371 of my
creditors have I sold you? Yea, to whom have I sold you? Behold, for
your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is
your mother put away.

7:2 <388 when I came, there was no man; when I called, yea, <8
was none to answer. O house of Israel, is my hand shortened at all that
it cannot redeem, or have I no <334 to deliver? <63 at my rebuke I
dry up the sea, I make <173 rivers a wilderness and <5 fish to
stink because the waters are dried up, and they die <9 of thirst.

7:3 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth <31
covering.

7:4 The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should
know how to speak a word in season unto <252 O <102 of <341 When
ye are weary he waketh morning by morning. He <5 mine ear to hear
as the learned.

7:5 The Lord God hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,
neither turned away back.

7:6 I gave my back to the smiter, and my cheeks to them that plucked
off the hair. I hid not my face from shame and spitting.

7:7 For the Lord God will help me, therefore <318 I not be confounded.
Therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I <20 not
be ashamed.

7:8 And the Lord is near, and he justifieth me. Who will <399 with
me? Let us stand together. Who is mine adversary? Let him come near me,
and I will smite him with the strength of my mouth.

7:9 For the Lord God will help me. And all they who <64 condemn me,
behold, all they <7 wax old as a garment, and the moth <9 eat
them up.

7:10 Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of
his servant, that walketh in darkness and hath no light?

7:11 Behold all ye that kindle fire, that compass yourselves about with
sparks, walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks <408 ye have
kindled. This <67 ye have of mine hand—ye <6 lie down in sorrow.

2 <478 <478 8

8:1 Hearken unto me, ye that follow after righteousness. Look unto the
rock from whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit from <12 ye
are digged.

8:2 Look unto Abraham, your father, and unto Sarah, she that bare you;
for I called him alone, and blessed him.

8:3 For the Lord <79 comfort Zion, he will <4 all her waste
places; and he will make her <421 like Eden, and her desert like
the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness <32 be found therein,
thanksgiving and the <172 of melody.

8:4 <110 unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation; for
a law <32 proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a
<178 for the people.

8:5 My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arm
<36 judge the <21 The isles <6 wait upon me, and on mine arm
<9 they trust.

8:6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath;
for the heavens <24 vanish away like smoke, and the <13 <8 wax
old like a garment; and they that dwell therein <12 die in like
manner. But my <75 <9 be forever, and my <85 <6
not be abolished.

8:7 <136 unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose
heart I have written my law, fear ye not the reproach of men, <507
be ye afraid of their revilings.

8:8 For the moth <49 eat them up like a <385 and the worm <10
eat them like wool. But my <68 <9 be <74 and my
<81 from generation to generation.

8:9 Awake, awake! Put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake as in the
ancient days. Art thou not he that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the
dragon?

8:10 Art thou not he who hath dried the sea, the waters of the great
deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to
pass over?

8:11 Therefore, the redeemed of the Lord <92 return, and come with
singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy and holiness <14 be upon <137
heads; and they <8 obtain <327 and joy; sorrow and mourning
<9 flee away.

8:12 I am he; yea, I am he that comforteth you. Behold, who art thou,
that thou shouldst be <179 of man, who <30 die, and of the son of
man, who <10 be made like unto grass?

8:13 And forgettest the Lord thy maker, that hath stretched forth the
<299 and laid the foundations of the earth, and hast feared
continually every day, because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he
were ready to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor?

8:14 The captive exile hasteneth, that he may be loosed, and that he
should not die in the pit, nor that his bread <10 fail.

8:15 But I am the Lord thy God, <312 waves roared; the Lord of Hosts
is my name.

8:16 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the
shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the <407 and lay the
<119 of the <119 and say unto Zion: <176 thou art my
<460

8:17 <311 awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand
of the Lord the cup of his fury—thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup
of trembling wrung out—

8:18 And none to guide her among all the sons she hath brought forth;
<411 that taketh her by the <86 of all the sons she hath <16
up.

8:19 These two sons are come unto thee, who <242 be sorry for thee—thy
desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword—and by whom
<18 I comfort thee?

8:20 Thy sons have fainted, save these two; they lie at the head of all
the streets; as a wild bull in a net, they are full of the fury of the
Lord, the rebuke of thy God.

8:21 Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, and not with
wine:

8:22 Thus saith thy <30 the Lord and thy God pleadeth the cause of
his people; behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of
trembling, the <171 of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it
again.

8:23 But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; who
have said to thy soul: Bow down, that we may go over—and thou hast laid
thy body as the ground and as the street to them that went over.

8:24 <263 <263 put on thy strength, O <496 put on thy beautiful
garments, O <273 the holy city; for henceforth there <188 no
more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.

8:25 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit <73 O Jerusalem; loose
<11 from the bands of thy neck, O <419 daughter of Zion.

2 Nephi Chapter 9

9:1 And now, my beloved brethren, I have read <234 things that ye
might know concerning the covenants of the Lord that he has covenanted
with all the house of Israel—

9:2 That he has spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of his holy
prophets, even from the beginning <83 from generation to generation,
until the time comes that they <118 be restored to the true church and
fold of God; when they <14 be gathered home to the lands of their
inheritance, and <12 be established in all <9 <12 of promise.

9:3 <452 my <105 <105 I speak unto you <106 <106 that ye
may rejoice, and lift up your heads forever, because of the blessings
<462 the Lord God <43 bestow upon your children.

9:4 For I know that ye have searched much, many of you, to know of
<45 to come; wherefore I know that ye know that our flesh must waste
away and die; nevertheless, in our bodies we <47 see God.

9:5 Yea, I know that ye know that in the body he <18 show himself
unto those at <266 from whence we came; for it is expedient that
it should be among them; for it behooveth the great Creator that he
suffereth <31 to become subject unto man in the flesh, and die for
all men, that all men <239 <17 <17 unto him.

9:6 For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan
of the <49 Creator, <331 must needs be a power of resurrection, and
the resurrection must <11 come unto man by reason of the fall; and
the fall came by <10 of transgression; and <184 man became fallen
they were cut off from the presence of the Lord.

9:7 Wherefore, it must <41 be an infinite atonement—save it <119 be
an <7 atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption.
<23 the first judgment <225 came upon man must <29 have
remained to an endless duration. And if so, this <203 must have laid
down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.

9:8 O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace! For behold, if the <36
<73 rise no more our spirits must <166 <166 to that angel who
fell from before the <108 of the Eternal God, and <123 the devil,
to rise no <51

9:9 And our <33 must have <34 like unto him, and we <6
devils, angels to a <27 to be shut out from the <42 of our God,
and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself;
yea, to that being who beguiled our <143 parents, who transformeth
<269 nigh unto an <84 of light, and stirreth up the children of
men unto secret combinations of murder and all manner of <8 works
of darkness.

9:10 O how <261 the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our
escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, <299
and hell, <209 I call the <8 of the body, and also the <7 of the
spirit.

9:11 And <276 of the way of deliverance of our God, the Holy One of
Israel, this death, of <39 I have spoken, <4 is the temporal,
<413 deliver up its dead; <10 <43 is the grave.

9:12 And this <10 of <13 I have <27 <4 is the spiritual
<38 <28 <28 up its <28 <11 <9 <19 is hell;
wherefore, <5 and hell must <15 up their dead, and hell must
<8 up its captive spirits, and the grave must <9 up its
<10 bodies, and the <502 and the <236 of men will be restored
one to the other; and it is by the <418 of the <415 of the
Holy One of Israel.

9:13 O how <181 the plan of our God! For on the other hand, the
paradise of God must <61 up the <53 of the righteous, and the
<73 <11 up the body of the righteous; and the spirit and the body
is <71 to itself again, and all men <310 incorruptible, and
immortal, and they are living souls, having a perfect knowledge like
unto us in the flesh, save it be that our <13 <154 be perfect.

9:14 <450 we <9 have a <27 <14 of all our guilt, and
our uncleanness, and our nakedness; and the righteous <19 have a
<20 <20 of <171 enjoyment, and <3 righteousness, <342
clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness.

9:15 And it <30 come to pass that when all men <8 have passed from
this <370 <215 unto life, insomuch as they have <107 <104 they
must appear <454 the judgment-seat of the Holy One of Israel; and
then cometh the judgment, and then must they be judged according to the
holy judgment of God.

9:16 And assuredly, as the Lord liveth, for the Lord God hath spoken
it, and it is his eternal word, <288 cannot pass away, that they who
are <121 <83 be <3 still, and they who are filthy <9
be <4 still; <306 they who are <6 are the devil and his
angels; and they <19 go away into everlasting fire; prepared for
them; and <150 torment is as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame
ascendeth up forever and ever and has no end.

9:17 O the greatness and the justice of our God! For he executeth all
his words, and they have gone forth out of his mouth, and his law must
be fulfilled.

9:18 But, behold, the <307 the saints of the Holy One of <456
they who have believed in the Holy One of <11 they who have endured
the crosses of the world, and despised the shame of it, they <113
inherit the kingdom of God, <158 was <116 for them from the
foundation of the <26 and <122 joy <22 be full forever.

9:19 O the <106 of the mercy of our God, the Holy One of Israel!
For he delivereth his <84 from that awful monster the devil, and
<503 and hell, and that lake of fire and <160 <61 is endless
torment.

9:20 O how <446 the holiness of our God! For he knoweth all things,
and there is not anything save he knows it.

9:21 And he <298 into the world that he may save all men if they will
hearken unto his voice; for <164 he suffereth the pains of all men,
yea, the <7 of every <448 creature, both men, women, and children,
who belong to the family of Adam.

9:22 And he <33 this that the resurrection might pass upon all
men, that all <8 stand <379 him at the <100 and <359 day.

9:23 And he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be baptized
in his name, <510 <462 faith in the Holy One of <229 or they
<365 be saved in the <216 of God.

9:24 And if they will not repent and believe in his <35 and be
<43 in his <7 and endure to the end, they must be damned; for
the Lord God, the Holy One of <52 has <425 it.

9:25 Wherefore, he has given a law; and where <187 is no law <9
<6 is no punishment; and <12 <6 is no punishment <4 is no
condemnation; and <11 <7 is no condemnation the mercies of the
Holy One of Israel have claim upon them, because of the atonement; for
they are delivered by the power of him.

9:26 For the atonement satisfieth the demands of his <416 upon all
those who have not the law <72 to <39 that they are <34 from
that <313 monster, death and <309 and the <317 and the lake of fire
and <313 <313 is <313 torment; and they are restored to that
God who gave them breath, <16 is the Holy One of Israel.

9:27 But wo unto him that has the law given, yea, that has all the
commandments of God, like unto us, and that transgresseth <75 and
that wasteth the days of his probation, for <78 is his state!

9:28 O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the
frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think
they are wise, and they <363 not unto the counsel of God, for they
set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, <482
wisdom is <38 and it profiteth them not. And they <492 perish.

9:29 But to be <49 is good if they <45 unto the counsels of
God.

9:30 But wo unto the rich, who are rich as to the things of the world.
For <237 they are rich they despise the poor, and they persecute the
meek, and <69 hearts are upon <4 treasures; <76 <3
treasure is <4 God. And <460 <4 <7 <74 perish with
them also.

9:31 And wo unto the deaf that will not hear; for they <21 <95

9:32 Wo unto the blind that will not see; for they <16 <37 <34

9:33 Wo unto the uncircumcised of heart, for a knowledge of <56
iniquities <20 smite them at the last day.

9:34 Wo unto the liar, for he <17 be thrust down to hell.

9:35 Wo unto the murderer who deliberately killeth, for he <19 die.

9:36 Wo unto them who commit whoredoms, for they <14 be <33 down
to <34

9:37 Yea, wo unto <360 that worship idols, for the devil of all devils
delighteth in them.

9:38 And, in fine, wo unto all <24 who die in <95 sins; for they
<47 return to God, and behold his face, and remain in <16 sins.

9:39 O, my beloved brethren, remember the awfulness in transgressing
against that Holy God, and also the <11 of yielding to the
enticings of that <332 one. Remember, to be carnally-minded is
death, and to be spiritually-minded is life eternal.

9:40 O, my <46 <46 give ear to my words. Remember the
greatness of the Holy One of <420 Do not say that I have spoken hard
<283 <65 you; for if ye do, ye will revile <9 the truth; for
I have <20 the words of your Maker. I know that the <8 of truth
are hard <23 all uncleanness; but the righteous fear them not, for
they love the <18 and are not shaken.

9:41 O then, my <85 <85 come unto the Lord, the Holy One.
<88 that his paths are righteous. Behold, the way for man is
narrow, but it lieth in a straight course before him, and the keeper of
the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there;
and there is none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be
deceived, for the Lord God is his name.

9:42 And whoso knocketh, to him will he open; and the <504 and the
learned, and they that are <450 who are puffed up <442 of <247
learning, and <4 wisdom, and <3 riches—yea, they are they whom he
despiseth; and save they <277 cast these <189 away, and consider
themselves fools <106 God, and come down in the depths of humility,
he will not open unto <323

9:43 But the <30 of the wise and the prudent <40 be hid from them
forever—yea, that happiness which is prepared for the saints.

9:44 O, my <188 <188 <319 my <271 <177 I take off my
garments, and I shake them <67 you; I pray the God of my salvation
that he view me with his all-searching eye; wherefore, ye <57 know at
the last day, when all men <10 be judged of <123 works, that the God
of Israel did witness that I shook your <500 from my soul, and
that I stand with brightness <59 him, and am rid of your blood.

9:45 O, my <89 <89 turn away from your <437 <82 off the
chains of him that would bind you fast; come unto that God who is the
rock of your salvation.

9:46 Prepare your souls for that glorious day when justice <87 be
administered unto the righteous, even the day of judgment, that ye may
not shrink with awful fear; that ye may not <156 your <8 guilt
in perfectness, and be constrained to exclaim: Holy, holy are thy
judgments, O Lord God Almighty—but I know my guilt; I transgressed thy
law, and my transgressions are mine; and the devil hath obtained me,
that I am a prey to his <48 misery.

9:47 But behold, my <127 is it expedient that I should awake you
to an <21 reality of <291 things? Would I harrow up your <113 if
your minds were pure? <12 I be plain unto you according to the
plainness of the <459 if ye were freed from sin?

9:48 <265 if ye were holy I <172 speak unto you of holiness; but as
ye are not holy, and ye look upon me as a teacher, it must needs be
<82 that I teach you the consequences of sin.

9:49 <45 my soul abhorreth sin, and my heart delighteth in
righteousness; and I will praise the holy name of my God.

9:50 Come, my <126 every one that thirsteth, come ye to the
waters; and he that hath no money, come buy and eat; yea, come buy wine
and milk without money and <3 price.

9:51 Wherefore, do not spend <12 for that <399 is of no worth, nor
your labor for that <11 cannot satisfy. Hearken diligently unto me,
and <249 the words <12 I have spoken; and come unto the Holy One
of Israel, and feast upon that <17 perisheth not, neither can be
corrupted, and let your soul delight in fatness.

9:52 <131 my <359 <106 <43 the <43 of your God; pray
unto him continually by day, and give thanks unto his holy name by
night. Let your hearts rejoice.

9:53 And behold how great the covenants of the Lord, and how <8 his
condescensions unto the children of men; and because of his greatness,
and his grace and mercy, he has promised unto us that our seed <387
not utterly be destroyed, <274 to the flesh, but that he <257
preserve them; and in future generations they <22 become a righteous
branch unto the house of Israel.

9:54 And now, my <111 I <29 <286 unto you more; but on the
morrow I will declare unto you the remainder of my words. Amen.

2 Nephi Chapter 10

10:1 And now I, Jacob, <35 unto you again, my <155 <44
concerning this <63 <62 of <184 I have spoken.

10:2 For <405 the promises <12 we have <428 are <6 unto
us <106 to the flesh; wherefore, as it has been shown unto me that
many of our <151 <108 perish in the flesh <153 of unbelief,
nevertheless, God will be merciful unto many; and our <19 <19 be
restored, that they may come to that <56 will give them the true
knowledge of their Redeemer.

10:3 <314 as I said unto you, it must <403 be <402 that
Christ—for in the last night the angel spake unto me that this <496
be his name—should come among the Jews, <3 those who are the more
wicked part of the world; and they <73 crucify him—for thus it
behooveth our God, and there is none other nation on earth that <198
<19 <75 God.

10:4 For <51 the mighty miracles be wrought <48 <22 nations they
<21 repent, and know that he be <25 God.

10:5 But <140 of priestcrafts and iniquities, they at Jerusalem will
stiffen <18 necks against him, that he be crucified.

10:6 <124 <24 of <15 <23 destructions, famines,
pestilences, and bloodshed <87 come upon <296 and they who <7 not
be destroyed <5 be scattered <68 all nations.

10:7 But <232 thus saith the Lord God: When the day cometh that they
<24 believe in me, that I am Christ, then have I covenanted with
<58 fathers that they <18 be restored in the <359 upon the earth,
unto the lands of <18 inheritance.

10:8 And it <22 come to pass that they <6 be gathered in from
<20 long dispersion, from the isles of the sea, and from the four
parts of the earth; and the <159 of the Gentiles <30 be <451 in
the eyes of me, <96 God, in carrying them forth to the <63 of <43
<64

10:9 Yea, the kings of the <32 <32 be nursing <96 unto them,
and <21 queens <10 <441 <10 mothers; <351 the <361
of the Lord are <52 unto the Gentiles, for he hath spoken it, and who
can dispute?

10:10 But <162 this land, said God, <36 be a land of thine
inheritance, and the <57 <11 be blessed upon the land.

10:11 And this land <13 be a land of liberty unto the <53 and
<302 <12 be no <89 upon the <45 who <8 raise up unto the
Gentiles.

10:12 And I will fortify this land <272 all <305 <237

10:13 And he that fighteth <12 Zion <31 perish, <146 God.

10:14 For he that raiseth up a king <17 me <17 <17 for I, the
Lord, the king of heaven, will be <143 king, and I will be a light
unto them forever, that hear my words.

10:15 <326 for this cause, that my covenants may be fulfilled
<476 I have made unto the <493 of men, that I will do unto them
while they are in the <288 I must <477 destroy the secret works of
darkness, and of murders, and of abominations.

10:16 <53 he that <109 <92 Zion, both Jew and Gentile,
both bond and free, both male and female, <105 perish; for they are
they who are the whore of all the <296 for they who are not for me
are <39 me, <146 our God.

10:17 For I will fulfil my <265 <100 I have made unto the <100
of men, that I will do unto them <100 they are in the flesh—

10:18 <84 my beloved brethren, thus <44 our God: I will
afflict thy seed by the hand of the Gentiles; nevertheless, I will
soften the hearts of the <259 that they <97 be like unto a
father to <489 <335 the <295 <12 be <295 and numbered
<487 the house of Israel.

10:19 <59 I will consecrate this land unto thy seed, and them
who <28 be <26 <25 thy <10 <224 for the land of <240
inheritance; for it is a choice <311 <87 God unto me, above all
<298 lands, wherefore I will have all men that dwell thereon that they
<41 worship me, <24 God.

10:20 And now, my <123 <123 seeing that our merciful God has
given us so <423 knowledge concerning these things, let us remember
him, and lay aside our sins, and not hang down our heads, for we are
not cast off; <145 we have been driven out of the land of our
<92 but we have been led to a better <95 for the Lord has
made the sea our path, and we are upon an isle of the sea.

10:21 But <74 are the <241 of the Lord unto them who are upon the
isles of the sea; <128 as it says isles, <461 must <338 be more
than this, and they are inhabited also by our brethren.

10:22 For behold, the Lord God has led away from time to time from the
<217 of Israel, according to his will and pleasure. And now <25
the Lord remembereth all them who have been broken off, <63 he
<11 us also.

10:23 Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and <164 that ye are free to
act for yourselves—to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of
eternal life.

10:24 <276 my <212 <212 reconcile yourselves to the will
of God, and not to the will of the devil and the flesh; and remember,
after ye are reconciled unto God, that it is only in and through the
grace of God that ye are saved.

10:25 <52 may God raise you from <70 by the power of the
resurrection, and also from <82 <12 by the <12 of the
atonement, that ye may be received into the <91 kingdom of God,
that ye may praise him <57 <55 divine. Amen.

2 Nephi Chapter 11

11:1 And now, Jacob spake many more things to my people at that time;
nevertheless only <321 <11 have I caused to be written, for the
<10 <499 I have written sufficeth me.

11:2 And now I, Nephi, write more of the words of Isaiah, for my soul
delighteth in his words. For I will liken his <16 unto my people, and
I will send them forth unto all my children, for he verily saw my
Redeemer, even as I have seen him.

11:3 And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I have seen him;
<512 I will send <474 <51 <42 unto my children to prove unto
them that my <12 are true. <186 by the <6 of three, God hath
said, I will establish my word. Nevertheless, God sendeth more
witnesses, and he proveth all his <98

11:4 Behold, my soul <109 in proving unto my <158 the truth of
the coming of Christ; for, for this end hath the law of Moses been
given; and all <163 <163 have been <505 of God from the beginning
of the world, unto man, are the typifying of him.

11:5 And also my soul <57 in the covenants of the Lord <35 he
hath made to our fathers; yea, my soul <18 in his grace, and in
his justice, and power, and mercy in the <486 and <279 plan of
deliverance from death.

11:6 And my soul <31 in <106 unto my <106 that save Christ
should come all men must perish.

11:7 For if <501 be no <17 <4 be no God; and if <6 be no God
we are not, for <9 could have been no creation. But <7 is a God,
and he is Christ, and he cometh in the fulness of his own time.

11:8 And now I <300 some of the <215 of <300 that whoso of my
<81 shall see <341 <12 may lift up <250 hearts and rejoice for
all men. Now <14 are the words, and ye may <318 them unto you and
unto all men.

2 <398 <398 12

12:1 The word that <53 the son of Amoz, saw concerning Judah and
Jerusalem:

12:2 And it <63 come to pass in the last days, when the mountain of
the Lord’s house <16 be established in the top of the mountains, and
<11 be exalted above the hills, and all nations <9 flow unto it.

12:3 And many <110 <11 go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the
<51 of the Lord, to the <52 of the God of Jacob; and he will
teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion
<47 go <400 the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

12:4 And he <19 judge among the nations, and <6 rebuke many
people: and they <7 beat <184 swords into plow-shares, and <5
spears into pruning-hooks—nation <12 not lift up sword against
nation, neither <9 they learn war any more.

12:5 O <91 of <481 come ye and let us walk in the light of the
Lord; yea, come, for ye have all gone astray, every one to his wicked
ways.

12:6 Therefore, O <131 thou hast forsaken thy people, the <44 of
<45 because they be replenished from the east, and hearken unto
soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the
children of strangers.

12:7 Their land also is full of silver and gold, <98 is <348 any
end of <118 treasures; <2 land is also full of horses, <16 is
<17 any end of <14 chariots.

12:8 <38 land is also full of idols; they worship the work of <18
own hands, that <482 <6 own fingers have made.

12:9 And the mean man boweth not down, and the <475 man humbleth
himself not, therefore, forgive him not.

12:10 O ye <139 ones, enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust,
for the fear of the Lord and the glory of his majesty <203 smite thee.

12:11 And it <9 come to pass that the lofty looks of man <10 be
humbled, and the haughtiness of men <9 be bowed <75 and the Lord
alone <9 be <360 in that day.

12:12 For the day of the Lord of Hosts soon <497 upon all <292
yea, upon <231 one; yea, upon the proud and lofty, and upon <10 one
who is lifted up, and he <45 be brought low.

12:13 Yea, and the day of the Lord <15 come upon all the cedars of
Lebanon, for they are high and <33 up; and upon all the oaks of
Bashan;

12:14 And upon all the high <456 and upon all the <453 and upon
all the <456 <202 are <33 up, and upon <75 people;

12:15 And upon <8 high tower, and upon <5 fenced wall;

12:16 And upon all the ships of the sea, and upon all the <8 of
Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.

12:17 And the loftiness of man <101 be <170 <170 and the <179
of men <10 be made low; and the Lord <179 <8 be <179 in that
day.

12:18 And the idols he <15 utterly abolish.

12:19 And they <9 go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves
of the earth, for the fear of the Lord <22 come upon them and the
<273 of his <273 <11 <273 them, when he ariseth to shake
terribly the earth.

12:20 In that day a man <21 cast his <68 of silver, and his <5
of <412 <164 he hath made for <348 to worship, to the moles and to
the bats;

12:21 To go into the clefts of the <86 and into the tops of the
ragged <9 for the fear of the Lord <55 come upon them and the
<84 of his <90 <11 <87 <87 when he <87 to <87
<87 the <87

12:22 Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein
is he to be accounted of?

2 Nephi Chapter 13

13:1 For behold, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, doth take away from
Jerusalem, and from Judah, the stay and the staff, the whole staff of
bread, and the <7 stay of water—

13:2 The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet,
and the prudent, and the ancient;

13:3 The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor,
and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.

13:4 And I will give children unto them to be their princes, and babes
<146 rule over them.

13:5 And the people <11 be oppressed, <359 one by another, and <5
one by his neighbor; the child <16 behave <224 proudly against the
ancient, and the base <7 the honorable.

13:6 When a man <21 take hold of his brother of the house of his
father, and <14 say: Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let
not this ruin come under thy hand—

13:7 In that day <26 he swear, saying: I will not be a healer; for in
my <46 there is neither bread nor clothing; make me not a ruler of
the people.

13:8 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen, because <136
tongues and <4 doings have been <101 the <238 to provoke the
eyes of his glory.

13:9 The show of <22 countenance doth witness <22 <306 and doth
declare <10 sin to be even as Sodom, and they cannot hide it. Wo unto
<15 souls, for they have rewarded evil unto themselves!

13:10 Say unto the righteous that it is well with them; for they <119
eat the fruit of <31 doings.

13:11 Wo unto the wicked, for they <18 perish; for the reward of
<19 hands <9 be upon them!

13:12 And my people, <255 are <15 oppressors, and women rule over
<251 O my <13 they who lead thee cause thee to err and destroy the
way of thy paths.

13:13 The Lord standeth up to plead, and <5 to judge the <172

13:14 The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his <295
and the princes thereof; for ye have eaten up the vineyard and the
spoil of the poor in your houses.

13:15 What mean ye? Ye beat my <33 to pieces, and grind the faces of
the poor, saith the Lord God of Hosts.

13:16 Moreover, the Lord saith: Because the daughters of Zion are
haughty, and walk with stretched-forth necks and wanton eyes, walking
and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with <144 feet—

13:17 Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head
of the <48 of Zion, and the Lord will discover <30 secret
parts.

13:18 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of <19 <52
ornaments, and cauls, and round tires like the moon;

13:19 The chains and the bracelets, and the mufflers;

13:20 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands,
and the tablets, and the ear-rings;

13:21 The rings, and nose jewels;

13:22 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the
wimples, and the crisping-pins;

13:23 The glasses, and the fine linen, and hoods, and the veils.

13:24 And it <301 come to pass, instead of sweet smell <440 <9 be
stink; and <10 of a girdle, a rent; and <7 of well set hair,
baldness; and <8 of a stomacher, a girding of sackcloth; burning
<10 of beauty.

13:25 Thy men <39 fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war.

13:26 And her gates <18 lament and mourn; and she <6 be desolate,
and <5 sit upon the ground.

2 Nephi Chapter 14

14:1 And in that day, seven <383 <22 take hold of one man, saying:
We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be
called by thy name to take away our reproach.

14:2 In that day <40 the branch of the Lord be beautiful and
glorious; the <475 of the earth excellent and comely to them that are
escaped of Israel.

14:3 And it <33 come to <172 they that are left in Zion and remain
in Jerusalem <15 be <66 holy, every one that is written among the
living in Jerusalem—

14:4 When the Lord <22 have washed away the filth of the <339 of
<340 and <13 have purged the blood of <42 from the midst
thereof by the spirit of <474 and by the <6 of burning.

14:5 And the Lord will create upon <64 dwelling-place of mount <39
and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a
flaming fire by night; for upon all the glory of Zion <66 be a
defence.

14:6 And <290 <11 be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from
the heat, and for a place of refuge, and a covert from storm and from
rain.

2 <246 <246 15

15:1 And then will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved,
touching his vineyard. My <11 hath a vineyard in a very
fruitful hill.

15:2 And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted
it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the <164 of it, and
also made a wine-press therein; and he looked that it should bring
forth grapes, and it brought <5 wild grapes.

15:3 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I
pray you, betwixt me and my <89

15:4 What could have been done more to my <97 that I have not done
in it? Wherefore, when I <62 that it <62 <62 <56 grapes it
<61 <5 wild <61

15:5 And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard—I
will take away the hedge <127 and it <211 be eaten up; and I will
break down the wall <15 and it <15 be trodden down;

15:6 And I will lay it waste; it <15 not be pruned nor digged; but
<250 <9 come up briers and thorns; I will also command the clouds
that they rain no rain upon it.

15:7 For the <118 of the Lord of Hosts is the house of Israel, and
the men of Judah his pleasant plant; and he <128 for judgment, and
behold, oppression; for righteousness, but <5 a cry.

15:8 Wo unto them that join <36 to house, till <75 can be no place,
that they may be placed alone in the <242 of the earth!

15:9 In mine ears, said the Lord of Hosts, of a truth many houses <109
be desolate, and great and fair cities without inhabitant.

15:10 Yea, ten acres of <102 <20 yield one bath, and the seed of
a homer <11 <11 an ephah.

15:11 Wo unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may
follow strong drink, that continue until night, and wine inflame them!

15:12 And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine are in
their feasts; but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither
consider the operation of his hands.

15:13 Therefore, my people are gone into captivity, because they have
no knowledge; and <37 honorable men are famished, and <6 multitude
dried up with thirst.

15:14 <31 hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth
<138 measure; and <24 glory, and <3 multitude, and <3 pomp,
and he that rejoiceth, <132 descend into it.

15:15 And the mean man <12 be <357 down, and the mighty man <8
be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty <10 be humbled.

15:16 But the Lord of <282 <12 be exalted in <268 and God that
is holy <11 be sanctified in righteousness.

15:17 Then <10 the lambs feed after <75 manner, and the waste
places of the fat ones <16 strangers eat.

15:18 Wo unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as
it were with a cart rope;

15:19 That say: Let him make speed, hasten his work, that we may see
it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come,
that we may know it.

15:20 Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil, that put
darkness for light, and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet,
and sweet for bitter!

15:21 Wo unto the wise in <120 own eyes and prudent in <6 own
sight!

15:22 Wo unto the <187 to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle
<325 drink;

15:23 Who justify the wicked for reward, and take away the
righteousness of the righteous from him!

15:24 <269 as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame
consumeth the chaff, <63 root <180 be rottenness, and <6 blossoms
<7 go up as dust; <321 they have cast away the law of the Lord of
<452 and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

15:25 <55 is the anger of the Lord kindled against his people,
and he hath stretched forth his hand <11 them, and hath smitten
them; and the hills did tremble, and <67 carcasses were torn in the
midst of the streets. For all this his <44 is not turned away, but
his hand is <42 out still.

15:26 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will
hiss unto them from the end of the earth; and behold, they <123 come
with speed swiftly; none <7 be weary nor stumble among them.

15:27 None <12 slumber nor sleep; <481 <5 the girdle of <87
loins be loosed, nor the latchet of <9 shoes be broken;

15:28 Whose arrows <23 be sharp, and all <15 bows bent, and <4
horses’ hoofs <13 be counted like flint, and <10 wheels like a
whirlwind, <6 roaring like a lion.

15:29 They <22 roar like young lions; yea, they <7 roar, and lay
hold of the prey, and <10 carry away safe, and none <6 deliver.

15:30 And in that day they <11 roar <190 them like the <49 of
the sea; and if they look unto the land, <136 <362 and sorrow,
and the <364 is darkened in the heavens thereof.

2 Nephi Chapter 16

16:1 In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting
upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.

16:2 Above it stood the seraphim; each one had six wings; with twain he
covered his face, and with <8 he <7 his feet, and with <7 he
did fly.

16:3 And one cried unto another, and said: Holy, holy, <1 is the
Lord of Hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.

16:4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried,
and the house was <89 with smoke.

16:5 Then said I: Wo is unto me! for I am undone; <408 I am a man of
unclean lips; and I dwell in the <356 of a people of <12 <12 for
mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts.

16:6 Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his
hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;

16:7 And he laid it upon my mouth, and <135 Lo, this has touched thy
<63 and thine iniquity is <32 <419 and thy sin purged.

16:8 Also I heard the <130 of the Lord, saying: Whom <282 I send, and
who will go for us? Then I <44 Here am I; send me.

16:9 And he <12 Go and tell this people—Hear ye indeed, but they
understood not; and see ye <9 but they perceived not.

16:10 Make the heart of this <145 fat, and make <384 ears heavy, and
shut <6 eyes—lest they see with <5 eyes, and hear with <5
ears, and understand with <6 heart, and be converted and be healed.

16:11 Then said I: <98 how long? And he <76 Until the cities be
wasted without inhabitant, and the houses <5 man, and the land be
utterly desolate;

16:12 And the Lord have removed men far <151 for there <135 be a
great forsaking in the <237 of the land.

16:13 But yet <19 <19 be a tenth, and they <6 return, and <3
be eaten, as a teil-tree, and as an oak whose substance is in them when
they cast <103 leaves; so the holy seed <26 be the <17
<445

2 <445 <445 17

17:1 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son
of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah the son
of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against
it, but could not prevail <7 it.

17:2 And it was told the <395 of David, <272 Syria is confederate
with Ephraim. And his <228 was moved, and the <5 of his people, as
the trees of the wood are <435 with the wind.

17:3 Then said the Lord unto Isaiah: Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou
and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in
the highway of the fuller’s field;

17:4 And say unto him: Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be
faint-hearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the
fierce anger of Rezin with <143 and of the son of Remaliah.

17:5 Because <12 Ephraim, and the son of <154 have <415 evil
counsel <143 thee, <131

17:6 Let us go up <11 Judah and vex it, and let us make a breach
therein for us, and set a king in the <288 of it, yea, the son of
Tabeal.

17:7 Thus saith the Lord God: It <261 not stand, <98 <4 it come
to pass.

17:8 For the head of <197 is Damascus, and the head of <5
Rezin; and within three score and five years <31 Ephraim be broken
that it be not a people.

17:9 And the head of <18 is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is
Remaliah’s son. If ye will not believe surely ye <38 not be
established.

17:10 Moreover, the Lord spake again unto <223 <138

17:11 Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the depths,
or in the heights above.

17:12 But Ahaz <471 I will not ask, <123 will I tempt the Lord.

17:13 And he <17 Hear ye now, O <326 of David; is it a small thing
for you to weary men, but will ye <5 my God also?

17:14 Therefore, the Lord himself <99 give you a sign—Behold, a
virgin <8 conceive, and <3 bear a son, and <5 call his name
Immanuel.

17:15 Butter and honey <13 he eat, that he may know to refuse the
evil and to choose the good.

17:16 For before the child <25 know to <20 the evil and <18 the
good, the land that thou abhorrest <16 be forsaken of both her kings.

17:17 The Lord <13 bring upon <308 and upon thy <425 and upon thy
father’s house, days that have not come from the day that <224
departed from <505 the king of Assyria.

17:18 And it <38 come to pass in that day that the Lord <10 hiss
for the fly that is in the uttermost part of Egypt, and for the bee
that is in the land of <42

17:19 And they <32 come, and <3 rest all of them in the desolate
valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon
all bushes.

17:20 In the same day <34 the Lord shave with a razor that is hired,
by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the
hair of the feet; and it <32 also consume the beard.

17:21 And it <11 come to pass in that day, a man <9 nourish a
young cow and two sheep;

17:22 And it <15 come to pass, for the abundance of milk they <10
give he <4 eat butter; for butter and <259 <7 every one eat that
is left in the land.

17:23 And it <17 come to pass in that day, <23 place <9 be,
where there were a thousand vines at a <4 silverlings, which
<15 be for briers and thorns.

17:24 With arrows and with bows <15 men come thither, because all the
land <9 become <23 and <23

17:25 And all hills that <13 be digged with the mattock, <54 <7
not come thither the fear of <26 and thorns; but it <13 be for the
sending forth of oxen, and the treading of lesser cattle.

2 Nephi Chapter 18

18:1 <502 the word of the Lord said unto me: Take thee a great
roll, and write in it with a man’s pen, concerning
Maher-shalal-hash-baz.

18:2 And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest,
and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

18:3 And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived and bare a son.
Then said the Lord to me: Call his name, <51

18:4 For behold, the <443 <111 not have knowledge to cry, My father,
and my mother, <458 the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria
<23 be taken away <15 the king of <372

18:5 The Lord spake also unto me again, saying:

18:6 Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go
softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son;

18:7 Now therefore, <77 the Lord bringeth up upon them the <28
of the <368 strong and many, even the king of Assyria and all his
glory; and he <79 come up over all his channels, and go over all his
banks.

18:8 And he <20 pass through Judah; he <5 overflow and go over, he
<7 reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings <13
fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.

18:9 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye <21 be broken in
pieces; and give ear all ye of far countries; gird <21 and ye
<19 be <19 in <18 gird <10 and ye <9 be <9 in
pieces.

18:10 Take counsel together, and it <15 come to naught; speak the
word, and it <10 not stand; for God is with us.

18:11 For the Lord <198 thus to me with a <155 hand, and instructed
me that I should not walk in the way of this <93 <216

18:12 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all to whom this <223 <54 say,
A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.

18:13 Sanctify the Lord of Hosts himself, and let him be your <19 and
let him be your dread.

18:14 And he <42 be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling,
and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and a
snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

18:15 And many among them <44 stumble and fall, and be broken, and be
snared, and be taken.

18:16 Bind up the testimony, seal the law <27 my disciples.

18:17 And I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the
house of Jacob, and I will look for him.

18:18 Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for
signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of Hosts, which dwelleth
in Mount Zion.

18:19 And when they <97 say unto you: Seek unto them that have
familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep and mutter—should not a
<206 seek unto <200 God for the living to hear from the dead?

18:20 To the law and to the testimony; and if they <292 not according
to this <295 it is because there is no light in them.

18:21 And they <71 pass <407 it hardly bestead and hungry; and it
<11 come to pass that when they <7 be hungry, they <4 fret
themselves, and curse <74 king and <3 God, and look upward.

18:22 And they <20 look unto the earth and behold trouble, and
darkness, dimness of anguish, and <15 be driven to darkness.

2 Nephi Chapter 19

19:1 Nevertheless, the <22 <19 not be such as was in her
vexation, when at first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun, and
the land of Naphtali, and afterwards did more grievously afflict by the
way of the Red Sea beyond Jordan in Galilee of the nations.

19:2 The <177 that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they
that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the <163
shined.

19:3 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and increased the joy—they joy
before thee <194 to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when
they divide the spoil.

19:4 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his
shoulder, the rod of his oppressor.

19:5 For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and
garments rolled in blood; but this <161 be with burning and fuel of
fire.

19:6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the
government <30 be upon his shoulder; and his name <8 be called,
Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The
Prince of Peace.

19:7 Of the increase of <34 and peace <315 is no end, upon the
throne of David, and upon his kingdom to order it, and to establish it
with judgment and with justice from henceforth, even forever. The zeal
of the Lord of Hosts will perform this.

19:8 The Lord sent his word unto Jacob and it hath lighted upon Israel.

19:9 And all the <241 <95 know, even Ephraim and the inhabitants of
Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart:

19:10 The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones;
the sycamores are cut <13 but we will change them into cedars.

19:11 Therefore the Lord <55 set up the adversaries of Rezin against
him, and join his enemies together;

19:12 The Syrians <274 and the Philistines behind; and they <28
devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned
away, but his hand is stretched out still.

19:13 For the <114 turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do
they seek the Lord of Hosts.

19:14 <82 will the Lord cut off from <55 head and tail, branch
and rush in one day.

19:15 The ancient, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies,
he is the tail.

19:16 For the leaders of this <69 cause them to err; and they that
are led of them are destroyed.

19:17 <67 the Lord <121 have no joy in their young men, <91
<10 have mercy on <9 fatherless and widows; for <373 one of them
is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and <12 mouth speaketh folly. For all
this his <150 is not <150 <149 but his hand is <149 out <149

19:18 For wickedness burneth as the fire; it <53 <183 the briers
and thorns, and <8 kindle in the thickets of the forests, and they
<11 mount up like the lifting up of smoke.

19:19 Through the wrath of the Lord of <335 is the land darkened, and
the <132 <29 be as the fuel of the <57 no man <10 spare his
brother.

19:20 And he <11 snatch on the right hand and be hungry; and he <11
eat on the left hand and they <9 not be satisfied; they <5 eat
<129 man the flesh of his own arm—

19:21 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; they together <22 be
<324 Judah. For all this his <148 is not <148 <148 but his hand
is <149 out <149

2 Nephi Chapter 20

20:1 Wo unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write
grievousness which they have prescribed;

20:2 To turn away the needy from judgment, and to take away the <108
from the poor of my people, that widows may be <242 prey, and that
they may rob the fatherless!

20:3 And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the
desolation <61 <107 come from far? to whom will ye flee for help?
and where will ye leave your glory?

20:4 Without me they <26 bow down under the prisoners, and they <8
fall <8 the slain. For all this his <142 is not <142 <142 but
his hand is <142 out <142

20:5 O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in <102 hand is
<4 indignation.

20:6 I will send him <190 a hypocritical nation, and <5 the
<270 of my <286 will I give him a charge to take the spoil, and to
take the <142 and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.

20:7 Howbeit he meaneth not so, <412 doth his heart think so; but in
his <7 it is to destroy and cut off nations not a few.

20:8 For he saith: Are not my princes altogether kings?

20:9 Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not Samaria
as Damascus?

20:10 As my hand hath founded the kingdoms of the idols, and whose
graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;

20:11 Shall I not, as I have done unto <43 and her <29 so do to
<24 and to her idols?

20:12 Wherefore it <213 come to pass that when the Lord hath performed
his whole work upon Mount Zion and upon Jerusalem, I will punish the
fruit of the stout <132 of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his
high looks.

20:13 For he <134 By the strength of my hand and by my wisdom I have
done these things; for I am prudent; and I have moved the borders of
the <361 and have robbed <254 treasures, and I have put down the
inhabitants like a valiant man;

20:14 And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people; and as
one gathereth eggs that are left have I gathered all the earth; and
there was none that <62 the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.

20:15 <175 the ax boast itself <309 him that heweth therewith?
<11 the saw magnify <11 <11 him that shaketh it? As if the rod
should shake <13 <13 them that lift it up, or as if the <364
<15 lift up <16 as if it were no wood!

20:16 Therefore <204 the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, send among his fat
ones, leanness; and <429 his <184 he <19 kindle a burning like the
<4 of a fire.

20:17 And the light of Israel <20 be for a fire, and his Holy One for
a flame, and <14 burn and <3 devour his thorns and his briers in
one day;

20:18 And <16 consume the <58 of his forest, and of his fruitful
field, both soul and body; and they <19 be as when a standard-bearer
fainteth.

20:19 And the rest of the trees of his forest <21 be few, that a
child may write them.

20:20 And it <16 come to pass in that day, that the remnant of
Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, <23 no more
again stay upon him that smote them, but <12 stay upon the <165 the
Holy One of <33 in truth.

20:21 The <44 <19 return, yea, even the <6 of <39 unto
the mighty God.

20:22 For though thy people <165 be as the sand of the sea, yet a
<27 of them <35 return; the consumption decreed <5 overflow
with righteousness.

20:23 For the Lord God of Hosts <15 make a consumption, even
determined in all the land.

20:24 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God of Hosts: O my <60 that
dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian; he <38 smite thee
with a rod, and <8 lift up his <304 <315 thee, after the manner
of Egypt.

20:25 For yet a very little while, and the indignation <26 cease, and
mine anger in <437 destruction.

20:26 And the Lord of <90 <18 stir up a scourge for him according
to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and as his rod was upon
the sea so <29 he lift it up <71 the <71 of <70

20:27 And it <16 come to pass in that day that his burden <10 be
taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and
the yoke <20 be destroyed because of the anointing.

20:28 He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath
laid up his carriages.

20:29 They are gone over the passage; they have <59 up <130 lodging
at Geba; Ramath is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.

20:30 Lift up the voice, O daughter of Gallim; cause it to be heard
unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.

20:31 Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves
to flee.

20:32 As yet <102 he remain at Nob that day; he <8 shake his hand
<229 the mount of the <54 of <257 the hill of Jerusalem.

20:33 Behold, the <368 the Lord of <213 <28 lop the bough with
terror; and the high ones of stature <13 be hewn down; and the
haughty <8 be humbled.

20:34 And he <9 cut down the thickets of the forests with iron, and
Lebanon <13 fall by a <394 one.

2 Nephi Chapter 21

21:1 And there <19 come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a
branch <15 grow out of his roots.

21:2 And the Spirit of the Lord <16 rest upon him, the spirit of
wisdom and understanding, the <7 of counsel and might, the <6
of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;

21:3 And <34 make him of quick understanding in the fear of the <17
and he <15 not judge <324 the sight of his eyes, neither reprove
<9 the hearing of his ears.

21:4 But with righteousness <25 he <25 the poor, and <21 with
equity for the meek of the earth; and he <18 <450 the earth with the
rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips <18 he slay the
wicked.

21:5 And <48 <12 be the girdle of his loins, and
faithfulness the <8 of his reins.

21:6 The wolf also <22 dwell with the lamb, and the leopard <8 lie
down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and fatling
together; and a <501 child <22 lead them.

21:7 And the cow and the bear <13 feed; <376 <26 ones <5 lie
down <27 and the lion <8 eat straw like the ox.

21:8 And the suckling <40 <14 play on the hole of the asp, and the
weaned <13 <13 put his hand on the cockatrice’s den.

21:9 They <13 not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, for the
<158 <14 be full of the <238 of the <360 as the waters cover
the sea.

21:10 And in that day <310 <25 be a root of <305 which <7 stand
for an ensign of the people; to it <11 the Gentiles seek; and his
rest <8 be glorious.

21:11 And it <9 come to pass in that day that the Lord <10 set his
hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people <55
<18 be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from
Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the
islands of the sea.

21:12 And he <38 set up an <93 for the nations, and <9 assemble
the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from
the four corners of the earth.

21:13 The envy of Ephraim also <31 depart, and the adversaries of
<25 <8 be cut off; <14 <5 not envy Judah, and <11 <6
not vex Ephraim.

21:14 But they <11 fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines towards
the west; they <13 spoil them of the east <273 they <8 lay
<285 hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon <14 obey
<312

21:15 And the Lord <11 utterly <254 the tongue of the Egyptian
sea; and with his mighty wind he <16 shake his hand over the river,
and <9 <429 it in the seven streams, and make men go over dry shod.

21:16 And <262 <20 be a highway for the <211 of his <211 <211
<12 be <211 from <211 like as it was to Israel in the day that
he came up out of the land of Egypt.

2 Nephi Chapter 22

22:1 And in that day thou shalt say: O <335 I will praise thee; though
thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away, and thou
comfortedst me.

22:2 Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid; for
the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also has become my
salvation.

22:3 Therefore, with joy <107 ye draw water out of the wells of
<18

22:4 And in that day <19 ye say: Praise the <87 call upon his name,
declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is
exalted.

22:5 Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things; this is
known in all the <315

22:6 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy
One of <183 in the midst of thee.

2 <174 <174 23

23:1 The burden of Babylon, <216 Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

23:2 Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto
them, <281 the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.

23:3 I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my <313
<8 for mine <217 is not upon them that rejoice in my highness.

23:4 The noise of the multitude in the mountains like as of a <114
<160 a tumultuous <16 of the kingdoms of nations gathered
together, the Lord of Hosts mustereth the hosts of the battle.

23:5 They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, yea, the
<211 and the weapons of his indignation, to <405 the whole land.

23:6 Howl ye, for the day of the Lord is at hand; it <244 come as a
destruction from the Almighty.

23:7 Therefore <14 all hands be faint, every man’s heart <8 melt;

23:8 And they <8 be <321 pangs and sorrows <6 take hold of
them; they <7 be amazed one at another; <498 faces <8 be as
flames.

23:9 <360 the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and
fierce anger, to lay the land desolate; and he <31 <103 the
sinners thereof out of it.

23:10 For the stars of heaven and the constellations <16 <22 not
give <59 light; the sun <8 be darkened in his going forth, and the
moon <11 not cause her light to shine.

23:11 And I will punish the world for evil, and the wicked for <38
iniquity; I will <26 the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will
lay down the haughtiness of the terrible.

23:12 I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than
the golden wedge of Ophir.

23:13 <463 I will <329 the heavens, and the earth <83 remove
out of her place, in the <145 of the Lord of Hosts, and in the day of
his <155 anger.

23:14 And it <30 be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man
taketh up; and they <18 <236 man turn to his own <329 and flee
<10 one into his own <287

23:15 Every one that is <123 <26 be thrust through; yea, and <21
one that is joined to the <150 <15 fall by the sword.

23:16 Their children, also <12 be dashed to pieces before <167 eyes;
<3 houses <11 be spoiled and <6 wives ravished.

23:17 <269 I will stir up the Medes against <467 <494 <21 not
regard silver and gold, nor <8 they delight in it.

23:18 <52 bows <11 also dash the young men to pieces, and they
<11 have no pity on the fruit of the womb; <57 eyes <12 not spare
children.

23:19 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees’
excellency, <22 be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

23:20 It <14 never be inhabited, neither <5 it be dwelt in from
generation to generation: <11 <11 the Arabian pitch tent there;
<8 <8 the shepherds make <66 fold there.

23:21 But wild beasts of the desert <17 lie <22 and <17 <146
<7 be full of doleful creatures; and owls <8 dwell there, and
satyrs <6 dance <34

23:22 And the wild <35 of the islands <14 cry in <34 desolate
houses, and dragons in <7 pleasant palaces; and her time is near to
come, and her day <24 not be prolonged. For I will <441 her
speedily; yea, for I will be merciful unto my <275 but the <245
<24 perish.

2 Nephi Chapter 24

24:1 For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel,
and set them in <69 own land; and the strangers <37 be <289 with
<246 and they <8 cleave to the house of Jacob.

24:2 And the people <14 take them and bring them to <35 place; yea,
from far unto the ends of the earth; and they <21 return to <17
lands of promise. And the <41 of Israel <13 possess <53 and the
land of the Lord <10 be for servants and handmaids; and they <8
take them captives unto whom they were captives; and they <12 rule
over <44 oppressors.

24:3 And it <12 come to pass in that day that the Lord <10 give
thee rest, from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard
bondage wherein thou wast made to serve.

24:4 And it <30 come to pass in that day, that thou shalt take up
this proverb <395 the king of <344 and say: How hath the
oppressor ceased, the golden city ceased!

24:5 The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, the scepters of the
rulers.

24:6 He who smote the <176 in wrath with a continual stroke, he that
ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth.

24:7 The whole earth is at <114 and is quiet; they break forth into
singing.

24:8 Yea, the fir-trees rejoice at thee, and also the cedars of
Lebanon, saying: Since thou art laid down no feller is come up <111
us.

24:9 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming; it
stirreth up the dead for <46 even all the chief ones of the <259 it
hath raised up from <216 thrones all the kings of the nations.

24:10 All they <182 speak and say unto thee: Art thou also become weak
as we? Art thou <7 like unto us?

24:11 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave; the noise of thy viols is
not heard; the worm is spread under <75 and the worms cover thee.

24:12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!
Art thou cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations!

24:13 For thou hast said in thy heart: I will ascend into <35 I
will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also upon the
mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north;

24:14 I will <37 <29 the heights of the clouds; I will be like the
Most High.

24:15 Yet thou <325 be <127 down to hell, to the <39 of the pit.

24:16 They that see thee <172 narrowly look upon <130 and <6
consider <5 and <5 say: Is this the man that made the <289 to
tremble, that did shake kingdoms?

24:17 And made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities
thereof, and opened not the <488 of his prisoners?

24:18 All the <241 of the nations, yea, all of <500 lie in glory,
every one of them in his own house.

24:19 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and
the remnant of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that
go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcass trodden <250 feet.

24:20 Thou <150 not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast
<102 thy land and slain thy people; the seed of evil-doers <142
never be renowned.

24:21 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquities of <357
fathers, that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face
of the <155 with cities.

24:22 For I will rise up <430 <137 saith the Lord of Hosts, and cut
off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, <19 the
Lord.

24:23 I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of
water; and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, <33 the
Lord of Hosts.

24:24 The Lord of Hosts hath sworn, <511 Surely as I have thought,
so <127 it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so <11 it stand—

24:25 That I will bring the Assyrian in my <124 and upon my mountains
tread him <191 foot; then <26 his yoke depart from off <120 and his
burden <8 from off <160 shoulders.

24:26 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth; and
this is the hand that is stretched out upon all nations.

24:27 For the Lord of <100 hath <82 and who <57 disannul? And
his hand is <25 out, and who <11 turn it back?

24:28 In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.

24:29 Rejoice not thou, <64 Palestina, <274 the rod of him that
smote thee is broken; for out of the serpent’s root <44 come forth a
cockatrice, and his fruit <9 be a fiery flying serpent.

24:30 And the first-born of the poor <16 feed, and the needy <5
lie down in safety; and I will kill thy root with famine, and he <16
slay thy remnant.

24:31 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; <81 <81 <81 art dissolved;
for there <23 come from the north a smoke, and none <9 be alone in
his appointed times.

24:32 What <13 then answer the messengers of the nations? That the
Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people <21 trust in it.

2 Nephi Chapter 25

25:1 Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat concerning the words which I have
written, <5 have been spoken by the mouth of Isaiah. For behold,
Isaiah spake many things <16 were hard for many of my <53 to
understand; for they know not <39 the manner of prophesying
among the Jews.

25:2 For I, <58 have not taught them many <37 <22 the
<23 of the Jews; for <300 works were <2 of darkness, and <7
doings were <2 of abominations.

25:3 Wherefore, I write unto my people, unto all those that <118
receive hereafter these <42 <79 I write, that they may know the
judgments of God, that they come upon all nations, according to the
word <23 he hath spoken.

25:4 <47 hearken, O my <46 <13 are of the house of Israel,
and give ear unto my words; for <304 the <154 of <138 are not
plain unto you, nevertheless they are <6 unto all <76 that are
filled with the spirit of prophecy. But I give unto you a prophecy,
<68 to the <14 <54 is in me; wherefore I <102 prophesy
<13 to the plainness <13 hath been with me from the time that I
came out from Jerusalem with my father; for <207 my soul delighteth
in <26 unto my <96 that they may learn.

25:5 Yea, and my soul <19 in the <94 of Isaiah, for I came out
from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath beheld the <164 of the Jews, and I
know that the Jews do understand the <14 of the prophets, and <350
is none other <259 that <14 the <14 <89 were <286 unto
the Jews like unto them, save it be that they are <254 after the
<251 of the <24 of the <274

25:6 But <102 I, <275 have not <21 my children <23 the <22
of the <274 but <16 I, of myself, have dwelt at <91
<155 I know <294 the regions round about; and I have made
mention unto my <34 <14 the <259 of God, <79 hath
come to pass <335 the <113 unto my children, <184 to all that
<17 <234 hath spoken, and I do not <310 them.

25:7 But <63 I proceed with mine own <225 <27 to my
plainness; in the <29 I know that no man can err; nevertheless, in
the days that the prophecies of <45 <239 be fulfilled men <4
know of a surety, at the times when they <11 come to pass.

25:8 <327 they are of worth unto the <100 of men, and he that
supposeth that they are not, unto them will I <486 particularly, and
confine the <240 unto mine own people; for I know that they <47 be
of great <40 unto them in the last days; for in that day <16 they
<227 them; wherefore, for <447 good have I written <128

25:9 And as one generation hath been destroyed <160 the Jews <389
of iniquity, even so have they been <13 from <18 to
<3 <145 to <37 iniquities; and never hath any of them
been <18 save it were foretold them by the prophets of the Lord.

25:10 <125 it hath been told them <223 the destruction
<176 should come upon <296 immediately <267 my father left
Jerusalem; <180 they hardened <51 hearts; and <56 to
my prophecy they have been destroyed, save it be <455 <31 are
carried away captive into Babylon.

25:11 And now this I <159 <101 of the <455 <21 is in me. And
notwithstanding they have been <28 away they <145 return again,
and possess the land of <63 <150 they <12 be restored
again to the land of <71 inheritance.

25:12 But, <283 they <18 have wars, and rumors of wars; and when
the day cometh that the Only Begotten of the Father, yea, even the
Father of heaven and of earth, <30 manifest himself unto them in the
flesh, <41 they will reject him, <91 of <55 iniquities, and
the hardness of <7 hearts, and the stiffness of <6 necks.

25:13 Behold, they will crucify him; and <160 he is laid in a
sepulchre for the space of three days he <56 rise from the dead, with
healing in his wings; and all <164 who <15 believe on his name <5
be saved in the kingdom of God. <220 my soul delighteth to
prophesy <221 him, for I have seen his day, and my heart doth
magnify his holy name.

25:14 And behold it <40 come to pass that <80 the Messiah hath
risen from the <69 and hath manifested <131 unto his people, unto
as many as will <71 on his name, <138 Jerusalem <33 be
<303 again; for wo unto them that fight against God and the people
of his church.

25:15 <88 the Jews <27 be scattered <360 all nations; yea,
and also Babylon <11 be destroyed; <240 the Jews <6 be
<18 by other nations.

25:16 And <84 they have been scattered, and the Lord God hath
scourged them by <21 nations for the <172 of many generations, yea,
even down from <396 to <2 until they <44 be persuaded
to <99 in Christ, the Son of God, and the atonement, <325 is
infinite for all mankind—and when that day <25 come that they <4
<26 in <26 and worship the <280 in his <131 with pure hearts
and clean hands, and look not forward any more for another Messiah,
then, at that time, the day will come that it must needs be expedient
that they <436 <45 these things.

25:17 And the Lord will set his hand <371 the second time to restore
his <171 from <308 lost and fallen state. <169 he will proceed
to do a marvelous work and a wonder <176 the children of men.

25:18 <22 he <100 bring forth his words unto <493 <121 <4
<10 judge them at the last day, for they <9 be given them for the
purpose of convincing them of the true <106 who was rejected by
them; and unto the <15 of them that they need not look <129
any more for a <300 to come, for there <116 not any <6 save it
<7 be a false <16 <67 <6 deceive the people; for <19 is
save one <12 spoken of by the prophets, and that <8 is he who
<23 be <64 of the Jews.

25:19 For according to the <104 of the <25 the <24 <502 in
six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem; and
<25 to the <25 of the <25 and also the word of the angel
of God, his name <134 be Jesus <252 the Son of God.

25:20 And now, my brethren, I have <85 plainly that ye cannot err.
And as the Lord God liveth that brought Israel up out of the land of
Egypt, and gave unto Moses power that he <104 heal the <351 <367
they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents, if they would cast
<250 eyes unto the serpent <152 he did raise up before <226 and also
gave him <39 that he <39 smite the rock and the water <7 come
forth; yea, <505 I say unto you, that as <312 things are true, and
as the Lord God liveth, <191 is none <421 name <255 under heaven
save it be this <129 <129 of <61 I have spoken, whereby man can
be saved.

25:21 <303 for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that
<54 <54 <29 I write <166 be kept and preserved, and handed down
unto my seed, from <464 to generation, that the promise may be
fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed <99 never perish as long as the
earth <9 stand.

25:22 <61 <49 <49 <46 go from <36 to <2 as
long as the <21 <12 stand; and they <4 go <249 to the will
and pleasure of God; and the <189 who <15 possess them <3 be
judged of them <22 to the <271 <93 are written.

25:23 For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and
also our <262 to <485 in <149 and to be reconciled to God;
for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, <248 all we can do.

25:24 And, notwithstanding we <34 in <34 we keep the law of
Moses, and look <427 with steadfastness unto <14 until the law
<88 be fulfilled.

25:25 For, for this end was the law given; wherefore the law hath
become dead unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of our
faith; yet we keep the law <10 of the commandments.

25:26 And we talk of <58 we rejoice in <4 we preach of <4
we prophesy of <5 and we <238 <152 to our prophecies, that
our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of
<357 sins.

25:27 <222 we speak concerning the law that our <28 may know
the deadness of the law; and they, by knowing the <9 of the law,
may look <135 unto that life <208 is in <67 and know for what
end the law was given. And <178 the law is <295 in <18 that
they need not harden <67 hearts against him when the law ought to be
done away.

25:28 And now behold, my people, ye are a stiffnecked people;
wherefore, I have <505 <505 unto you, that ye <507
misunderstand. And the <279 <71 I have <15 <205 stand as a
testimony <51 you; for they are sufficient to teach any man the
right way; for the <4 way is to <252 in <203 and deny him not;
for by denying him ye also deny the prophets and the law.

25:29 And now <80 I say unto you that the <37 way is to <37
in <120 and deny him not; and <44 is the Holy One of Israel;
<270 ye must bow down before him, and worship him with all your
might, mind, and strength, and your whole soul; and if ye do this ye
<109 in nowise be cast out.

25:30 And, inasmuch as it <14 be expedient, ye must keep the
performances and ordinances of God <345 the law <16 be <197
<147 was given unto Moses.

2 Nephi Chapter 26

26:1 And <220 <89 <23 have risen from the dead he <7 show
himself unto you, my <443 and my beloved brethren; and the <188
<42 he <18 <294 unto you <4 be the law <10 ye <6 do.

26:2 For <152 I say unto you that I have beheld that many
generations <20 pass away, and there <5 be great wars and
contentions among my people.

26:3 And <77 the Messiah <18 come <21 <3 be signs <101 unto
my people of his birth, and also of his death and resurrection; and
<39 and terrible <23 that day be unto the wicked, for they <9
perish; and they perish <445 they cast out the prophets, and the
saints, and stone them, and slay them; <217 the cry of the blood
of the saints <32 ascend up to God from the ground <309 them.

26:4 <429 all those who are proud, and that do wickedly, the day
that cometh <29 burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, for they <11
be as stubble.

26:5 And they that kill the <75 and the <74 the depths of the
earth <24 swallow them up, <35 the Lord of Hosts; and mountains
<12 cover <92 and whirlwinds <5 carry them <172 and buildings
<7 fall upon them and crush them to pieces and grind them to powder.

26:6 And they <20 be visited with thunderings, and lightnings, and
earthquakes, and all manner of destructions, for the fire of the anger
of the Lord <25 be kindled <128 <59 and they <7 be as
stubble, and the day that <121 <10 consume <15 <85 the Lord of
Hosts.

26:7 O the pain, and the anguish of my soul for the loss of the slain
of my people! For I, Nephi, have seen it, and it well nigh consumeth me
<417 the presence of the Lord; but I must cry unto my God: Thy ways
are just.

26:8 But <321 the righteous that hearken unto the <349 of the
<175 and destroy them not, but look forward unto <384 with
steadfastness for the <306 <357 are given, notwithstanding all
persecution—behold, they are they <10 <106 not perish.

26:9 But the Son of righteousness <12 appear unto <282 and he <6
heal <125 and they <6 have peace with him, <456 three <378
<9 have passed <208 and many of the fourth generation <10 have
<11 away in righteousness.

26:10 And when these things have passed away a speedy destruction
cometh unto my people; for, notwithstanding the pains of my soul, I
have seen it; wherefore, I know that it shall come to pass; and they
sell themselves for naught; for, for the reward of their pride and
<4 foolishness they <23 reap destruction; for because they yield
unto the devil and choose works of darkness rather than light,
therefore they must go down to hell.

26:11 For the Spirit of the Lord will not always strive with man. And
when the <14 ceaseth to <10 with man then <98 <102
destruction, and this grieveth my soul.

26:12 And as I spake concerning the convincing of the Jews, that Jesus
is the very Christ, it must needs be that the Gentiles be convinced
also that <18 is the <16 the Eternal God;

26:13 And that he manifesteth himself unto all those who believe in
him, by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kindred,
tongue, and people, working mighty miracles, signs, and wonders, among
the children of men according to <153 faith.

26:14 But behold, I prophesy unto you <91 the last days;
<5 the days when the Lord God <174 bring <229 <229 forth
unto the <37 of men.

26:15 After my seed and the seed of my brethren <24 have dwindled in
unbelief, and <7 have been smitten by the Gentiles; yea, after the
Lord God <13 have camped against them round about, and <8 have
laid siege <10 them with a mount, and raised forts <8 them;
and <30 they <19 have been brought down low in the dust, even that
they are not, yet the words of the righteous <21 be written, and the
prayers of the faithful <10 be heard, and all <167 who have <84
in unbelief <12 not be forgotten.

26:16 For <16 who <11 be destroyed <3 speak unto them out of the
ground, and <162 speech <12 be low out of the <67 and <10 voice
<11 be as one that hath a familiar spirit; for the Lord God will give
unto him power, that he may whisper <181 them, even as it were
out of the ground; and <38 <48 <37 <16 out of the dust.

26:17 For thus saith the Lord God: They <17 write the <205 which
<6 be done <246 <40 and they <7 be written and sealed up in a
book, and <106 who have <122 in <121 <17 not have <23 for
they seek to destroy the <38 of God.

26:18 Wherefore, as <26 who have been <132 have been <3
speedily; and the multitude of <83 terrible ones <37 be as chaff
that passeth away—yea, thus <81 the Lord God: It <14 be at an
instant, suddenly—

26:19 And it <13 come to pass, that <49 who have <75 in
<76 <12 be <279 by the hand of the Gentiles.

26:20 And the <410 are lifted up in the <512 of <65 eyes, and
have stumbled, <510 of the greatness of <11 stumbling block, that
they have built up many churches; nevertheless, they put down the <413
and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves <27 own wisdom and
<5 own learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of
the poor.

26:21 And there are many churches <51 up <196 cause envyings, and
strifes, and malice.

26:22 And <19 are also secret combinations, even as in times of old,
<456 to the combinations of the devil, for he is the founder of
all <443 things; yea, the <8 of murder, and works of darkness;
yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he
bindeth them with his strong cords forever.

26:23 For <501 my beloved brethren, I say unto you that the Lord God
worketh not in darkness.

26:24 He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world;
for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he
may draw all men unto him. <288 he commandeth none that they
<237 not partake of his salvation.

26:25 Behold, doth he cry unto any, saying: Depart from me? <10 I
say unto you, Nay; but he saith: Come unto me all ye ends of the earth,
buy milk and honey, without money and <3 price.

26:26 <33 hath he commanded any that they should depart out of the
synagogues, or out of the houses of worship? <21 I say unto you,
Nay.

26:27 Hath he <31 any that they <31 not <91 of his
salvation? Behold I say unto you, Nay; but he hath given it free for
all men; and he hath <30 his people that they <31 persuade all
men to repentance.

26:28 <59 hath the Lord <20 any that they <19 not <50
of his goodness? <50 I say unto you, Nay; but all men are privileged
the one like unto the other, and none are forbidden.

26:29 He <180 that <307 <178 be no priestcrafts; for, behold
priestcrafts are that men <369 and set <369 up for a light unto
the <225 that they may get gain and praise of the <241 but they
seek not the welfare of Zion.

26:30 <91 the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, the Lord
God hath <130 a commandment that all men <102 have charity, <389
charity is love, and except they <11 have <8 they were nothing.
<268 if they <10 have <10 they would not suffer the
laborer in Zion to perish.

26:31 But the <11 in Zion <109 labor for Zion; for if they <6
for <252 they <12 <23

26:32 And again, the Lord God hath <174 that men <50 not
murder; that they <6 not lie; that they <5 not steal; that they
<6 not take the name of the Lord <510 God in vain; that they
<15 not envy; that they <5 not have malice; that they <6 not
contend one with another; that they <9 not commit whoredoms; and
that they <8 do none of <481 <481 for whoso <424 them <85
<86

26:33 For none of <16 iniquities come of the Lord; for he <20 that
<159 is good among the children of men; and he <13 nothing save it
be plain unto the <14 of men; and he inviteth them all to come
unto him and <295 of his goodness; and he denieth none that come
unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he
remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and
Gentile.

2 Nephi Chapter 27

27:1 But, behold, in the last days, or in the days of the Gentiles—yea,
<319 all the nations of the Gentiles and also the Jews, both those
who <133 come upon this land and <9 who <8 be upon other lands,
yea, even upon all the lands of the <501 <51 they will be drunken
with iniquity and all manner of abominations—

27:2 And when that day <36 come they <3 be visited of the Lord of
Hosts, with thunder and with earthquake, and with a great noise, and
with storm, and with tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire.

27:3 And all the <99 that fight against Zion, and that distress
her, <50 be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it <11 be unto them,
even as unto a hungry man <231 dreameth, and <137 he eateth but he
awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man <21
<22 and <22 he drinketh but he <21 and <7 he is faint,
and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so <56 the multitude of all the
<84 be that <85 <85 Mount <475

27:4 For <160 all ye that <289 iniquity, stay yourselves and
wonder, for ye <32 cry out, and cry; yea, ye <7 be <178 but not
with wine, ye <9 stagger but not with strong drink.

27:5 For <41 the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep
sleep. For <15 ye have closed your eyes, and ye have rejected the
prophets; and your rulers, and the seers hath he covered because of
your iniquity.

27:6 And it <60 come to pass that the Lord God <8 bring forth unto
you the words of a book, and they <13 be the <9 of them <159 have
slumbered.

27:7 And <157 the book <18 be sealed; and in the book <7 be a
revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending
thereof.

27:8 Wherefore, <80 of the things <46 are sealed up, the <6
<7 are <7 <37 not be delivered in the day of the wickedness
and abominations of the people. Wherefore the book <19 be kept from
them.

27:9 But the book <13 be <31 unto a man, and he <8 deliver
the <103 of the <112 <51 are the <7 of <402 who have slumbered
in the dust, and he <23 <23 these <15 unto another;

27:10 But the <9 <28 are <79 he <17 not deliver, neither
<5 he <23 the book. For the book <8 be <17 by the power of
God, and the <137 <29 was <12 <15 be kept in the book
until the own due time of the Lord, that they may come forth; for
<246 they reveal all <139 from the foundation of the <165 unto
the end <165

27:11 And the day cometh that the <81 of the book <55 were <55
<56 be read upon the house tops; and they <9 be read by the <80
of Christ; and all <50 <12 be revealed unto the children of men
<34 ever have been among the <10 of men, and <10 ever will be
even unto the end of the earth.

27:12 <235 at that day when the book <42 be <195 unto the
man of whom I have spoken, the book <14 be hid from the eyes of the
world, that the eyes of none <15 <304 it save it be that three
witnesses <10 <10 it, by the <93 of God, besides him to whom the
book <15 be delivered; and they <5 testify to the truth of the
book and the <113 therein.

27:13 And there is none other <104 <23 view it, save it be a few
according to the will of God, to bear testimony of his word unto the
<133 of men; for the Lord God hath said that the <188 of the
faithful should speak as if it were from the dead.

27:14 <142 the Lord God will proceed to <443 <443 the <28 of
the book; and in the mouth of as many <119 as seemeth him good
will he establish his word; and wo be unto him that rejecteth the word
of God!

27:15 But <282 it <105 come to pass that the Lord God <8 say
unto him to whom he <8 <344 the book: Take <370 <64 <129 are
not <279 and <12 them to another, that he may show them unto the
learned, saying: Read this, I pray thee. And the learned <35 say:
Bring hither the <424 and I will read <452

27:16 And now, <497 of the glory of the <349 and to get gain will
they say <40 and not for the <17 of God.

27:17 And the man <48 say: I cannot <148 the <48 for it is sealed.

27:18 Then <16 the <67 say: I <18 read it.

27:19 Wherefore it <14 come to pass, that the Lord God will <109
again the book and the <123 thereof to him that is not learned; and
the man that is not <43 <32 say: I am not learned.

27:20 Then <11 the Lord God say unto him: The <20 <9 not read
them, for they have rejected <5 and I am able to do mine own work;
wherefore thou shalt read the <61 <184 I <28 give unto <165

27:21 Touch not the <337 <14 are sealed, for I will <124 them
<274 in mine own due time; for I will show unto the <323 of men
that I am able to do mine own work.

27:22 <311 when thou hast read the <59 <45 I have commanded
thee, and obtained the <305 <10 I have promised unto <10 then
<81 thou seal up the book again, and hide it up unto me, that I may
preserve the <38 <28 thou hast not read, until I <102 see fit in
mine own wisdom to reveal all <102 unto the <83 of men.

27:23 For <335 I am God; and I am a God of miracles; and I will show
unto the <276 that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and I
work not among the <43 of men save it be <470 to their faith.

27:24 And <243 it <74 come to pass that the Lord <7 say unto him
that <6 read the <98 that <5 be delivered him:

27:25 Forasmuch as this people draw near unto me with <44 mouth, and
with <5 lips do honor me, but have removed <8 hearts far from me,
and <7 fear towards me is taught by the precepts of men—

27:26 Therefore, I will <505 to do a marvelous work <98 this
people, yea, a <8 work and a wonder, for the <159 of <39
wise and <303 <81 perish, and the understanding of <11 prudent
<9 be hid.

27:27 And wo unto them that seek deep to hide <19 counsel from the
Lord! And <7 works are in the dark; and they say: Who seeth us, and
who knoweth us? And they also say: Surely, your turning of <219
upside down <52 be esteemed as the potter’s clay. But <220 I will
show unto <369 saith the Lord of Hosts, that I know all <53 works.
For <28 the work say of him that made it, he made me not? Or <14
the thing framed say of him that <5 it, he had no understanding?

27:28 But <54 <48 the Lord of Hosts: I will show unto the
<251 of men that it is yet a very little while and Lebanon <45 be
turned into a fruitful field; and the <4 field <12 be <99
as a forest.

27:29 And in that day <15 the deaf hear the <263 of the book, and
the eyes of the blind <16 see out of obscurity and out of darkness.

27:30 And the meek also <17 increase, and <126 joy <5 be in the
Lord, and the poor <242 men <11 rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

27:31 For assuredly as the Lord liveth they <19 see that the terrible
one is brought to naught, and the scorner is consumed, and all that
watch for iniquity are cut off;

27:32 And they that make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare
for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a <197
of naught.

27:33 <340 thus <189 the <97 who redeemed Abraham, concerning
the house of Jacob: Jacob <83 not now be ashamed, neither <6 his
face now wax pale.

27:34 But when he <304 his children, the work of my hands, in the
midst of him, they <29 sanctify my name, and <4 the Holy One of
Jacob, and <13 fear the God of <148

27:35 They also that erred in spirit <16 come to understanding, and
they that murmured <9 learn doctrine.

2 Nephi Chapter 28

28:1 And now, <292 my brethren, I have spoken unto you, according as
the Spirit hath constrained me; wherefore, I know that they must surely
come to pass.

28:2 And the <391 which <51 be written out of the book <7 be of
great worth unto the <330 of men, and especially unto our seed,
<25 is a remnant of the <158 of <103

28:3 For it <32 come to pass in that day that the churches <25 are
built up, and not unto the <193 when the one <23 say unto the other:
Behold, I, I am the Lord’s; and the others <15 say: I, I am the
<11 and thus <10 every one say that hath <41 up churches, and
not unto the Lord—

28:4 And they <21 contend one with another; and <353 priests <8
<9 one with another, and they <8 teach with <13 learning, and
deny the Holy Ghost, <86 giveth utterance.

28:5 And they deny the power of God, the Holy One of Israel; and they
say unto the people: Hearken unto us, and hear ye our precept; for
behold there is no God today, for the Lord and the Redeemer hath done
his work, and he hath given his <47 unto men;

28:6 <132 hearken ye unto my <37 if they <84 say <38 is a
miracle wrought by the hand of the <163 believe it not; for this day
he is not a God of miracles; he hath done his work.

28:7 Yea, and <37 <40 be many <116 <4 say: Eat, drink, and be
merry, for tomorrow we die; and it <14 be well with us.

28:8 And <29 <11 also be many <30 <5 say: Eat, <30 and be
merry; nevertheless, fear God—he will justify in committing a little
sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words,
dig a pit for thy neighbor; <45 is no harm in this; and do all these
things, for <73 we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God
will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we <77 be saved in the
kingdom of God.

28:9 Yea, and <53 <16 be many <97 <4 <255 after this manner,
false and vain and foolish doctrines, and <13 be puffed up in <270
hearts, and <9 seek deep to hide <9 counsels from the Lord; and
<7 works <14 be in the dark.

28:10 And the blood of the saints <15 cry from the ground against
them.

28:11 Yea, they have all gone out of the way; they have become
corrupted.

28:12 Because of pride, and <154 of <81 teachers, and <3
doctrine, <59 <425 have <22 corrupted, and <6 <6 are
lifted up; <20 of pride they are <95 up.

28:13 They rob the poor <15 of <23 fine sanctuaries; they rob the
poor <10 of <10 fine clothing; and they persecute the meek and
the poor in heart, <16 in <16 <42 they are <42 up.

28:14 They wear stiff necks and high heads; yea, and <21 of <86
and wickedness, and abominations, and whoredoms, they have all gone
astray save it be a few, who are the humble followers of Christ;
<285 they are led, that in many instances they do err <40
they are taught by the precepts of men.

28:15 O the wise, and the learned, and the rich, that are <80 up in
the <88 of <91 <220 and all those who preach <156 <236
and all <8 who commit <78 and pervert the right way of the
<421 wo, wo, wo be unto them, saith the Lord God Almighty, for they
<227 be thrust down to hell!

28:16 Wo unto them that turn aside the just for a thing of naught and
revile <248 that <307 is good, and say that is of no worth! For the
day <42 come that the Lord God will speedily visit the inhabitants of
the earth; and in that day that they are fully ripe in iniquity they
<28 perish.

28:17 But behold, if the <28 of the earth <14 repent of <126
wickedness and abominations they <9 not be destroyed, <105 the Lord
of Hosts.

28:18 But <31 that great and abominable church, the whore of all
the earth, must tumble to the <5 and <17 must be the fall
thereof.

28:19 For the <432 of the devil must shake, and they <120 belong to
it must needs be stirred up unto repentance, or the <19 will grasp
them with his everlasting chains, and they be <18 up to anger, and
perish;

28:20 For <78 at that day <97 he rage in the hearts of the
children of men, and stir them up to anger <182 that <62 is good.

28:21 And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal
security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion
prospereth, all is well—and thus the <86 cheateth <163 souls, and
leadeth them away carefully down to hell.

28:22 And <80 <49 he flattereth away, and telleth them there is
no hell; and he <184 unto them: I am no devil, for <15 is none—and
thus he whispereth in <47 ears, until he grasps them with his awful
<137 from whence <21 is no deliverance.

28:23 Yea, they are grasped with death, and <47 and <4 and hell,
and the <46 and all that have been seized therewith must stand
before the throne of God, and be judged according to <57 works, from
<49 they must go into the place prepared for <376 even a lake of
fire and brimstone, <166 is endless torment.

28:24 Therefore, wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion!

28:25 Wo be unto him that crieth: All is well!

28:26 Yea, wo be unto him that hearkeneth unto the <485 of men, and
denieth the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost!

28:27 Yea, wo be unto him that saith: We have received, and we need no
more!

28:28 And in fine, wo unto all <495 who tremble, and are angry because
of the truth of God! For <216 he that is built upon the rock
receiveth it with gladness; and he that is <13 upon a sandy
foundation trembleth lest he <318 fall.

28:29 Wo be unto him that <11 say: We have received the word of God,
and we need no more of the word of God, for we have enough!

28:30 For <66 thus <269 the Lord God: I will give unto the
<361 of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and
<264 a little; and blessed are <112 who hearken unto my precepts, and
lend an ear unto my counsel, for they <77 learn wisdom; for unto him
that <113 I will give more; and from them that <17 say, We have
enough, from them <8 be taken away even that <251 they have.

28:31 Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his
arm, or <29 <69 unto the <233 of men, save <304 <5
<11 be given by the <238 of the Holy Ghost.

28:32 Wo be unto the Gentiles, <130 the Lord God of Hosts! For
notwithstanding I <29 lengthen out mine arm unto them from day to
day, they will deny me; nevertheless, I will be merciful unto <345
<34 the Lord God, if they will repent and come unto me; for mine arm
is lengthened out all the day long, <23 the Lord God of Hosts.

2 Nephi Chapter 29

29:1 But <207 <182 <67 be many—at that day when I <7 proceed
to do a marvelous work among <61 that I may remember my covenants
<154 I have made unto the <227 of men, that I may set my hand
again the second time to recover my people, <24 are of the house of
Israel;

29:2 And also, that I may <45 the promises <20 I have made unto
thee, Nephi, and also unto thy father, that I would <19 your seed;
and that the words of your seed should <88 forth out of my mouth
unto your <19 and my <17 <102 hiss <14 unto the ends of the
earth, for a standard unto my <77 <57 are of the <77 of <76

29:3 And <420 my <31 <31 hiss forth—many of the Gentiles <6
say: A Bible! A <2 We have got a Bible, and <160 cannot be any
more Bible.

29:4 But thus <192 the Lord God: O fools, they <33 have a Bible; and
it <7 <91 <77 from the Jews, mine ancient covenant people. And
what thank they the Jews for the Bible <81 they receive from them?
Yea, what do the <71 mean? Do they <136 the travails, and the
labors, and the pains of the <41 and <333 diligence unto me, in
bringing <53 salvation unto the Gentiles?

29:5 O ye <330 have ye remembered the <25 mine <66 <66
people? Nay; but ye have cursed <252 and have hated <4 and have not
sought to <234 them. But <284 I will return all these things upon
your own heads; for I the Lord have not forgotten my <107

29:6 Thou fool, that <124 say: A <156 we have got a <5 and we
need no more <160 Have ye obtained a <125 save it were by the Jews?

29:7 Know ye not that <186 are more nations than one? Know ye not that
I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I <148 those
who are upon the isles of the sea; and that I rule in the heavens above
and in the earth beneath; and I bring <155 my word unto the <371
of men, yea, even upon all the <62 of the earth?

29:8 Wherefore murmur ye, <284 that ye <114 <217 more of my
word? Know ye not that the testimony of two <29 is a witness unto
you that I am God, that I <84 one nation like unto another?
Wherefore, I speak the same <325 unto one <13 like unto another.
And when the two <37 <53 run together the <45 of the two
<10 <10 run <10 also.

29:9 And I do this that I may prove unto many that I am the same
yesterday, today, and forever; and that I <57 <123 my <57
according to mine own pleasure. And <108 that I have spoken one word
ye need not suppose that I <383 <26 another; for my work is not yet
finished; neither <68 it be until the end of man, <9 from that
time henceforth and forever.

29:10 <116 <47 that ye have a <251 ye need not <45 that
it contains all my words; <30 need ye <11 that I have not
caused more to be written.

29:11 For I command all men, both in the east and in the west, and in
the north, and in the south, and in the islands of the sea, that they
<88 write the <125 <441 I <105 unto them; for out of the books
<11 <16 be written I will judge the world, every man <146 to
<438 works, <5 to that <19 is <73

29:12 For <403 I <28 <39 unto the Jews and they <7 <51 it;
and I <6 also <14 unto the Nephites and they <8 <14 it; and I
<6 also <14 unto the other tribes of the house of Israel, <49 I
have led away, and they <20 <26 it; and I <5 also <25 unto all
<259 of the <357 and they <12 <17 it.

29:13 And it <9 come to pass that the Jews <7 have the <124 of
the Nephites, and the <72 <11 have the <11 of the Jews; and
the <11 and the Jews <14 have the <14 of the lost <79 of
Israel; and the lost <7 of Israel <17 have the <17 of the
<28 and the Jews.

29:14 And it <17 come to pass that my people, <107 are of the <114
of <115 <15 be gathered home unto the lands of <177 possessions;
and my word also <15 be <15 in one. And I will show unto them
that fight against my word and <4 my <44 who are of the <44
of <44 that I am God, and that I covenanted with Abraham that I
would <447 his seed <332

2 Nephi Chapter 30

30:1 And now <231 my beloved brethren, I <23 <181 unto you; for
I, Nephi, <8 not suffer that ye should <339 that ye are more
righteous than the Gentiles <89 be. For <32 except ye <6 keep
the commandments of God ye <8 all likewise perish; and <388 of
the <156 <136 have been <439 ye need not <41 that the <35
are utterly destroyed.

30:2 For <41 I say unto you that as many of the <20 as will
repent are the covenant people of the Lord; and as many of the Jews as
will not <18 <63 be cast off; for the Lord covenanteth with none
save it be with them that <18 and believe in his Son, who is the
Holy One of Israel.

30:3 And now, I <131 prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews and
the Gentiles. For after the book of <107 I have <107 <58 come
forth, and be <425 unto the Gentiles, and sealed up again unto the
Lord, there <19 be many <26 <4 <63 the <138 <5 are
written; and they <10 carry them forth unto the remnant of our seed.

30:4 And then <16 the <12 of our seed know <72 us, how
that we came out from Jerusalem, and that they are descendants of the
<335

30:5 And the gospel of Jesus Christ <36 be declared among them;
wherefore, they <8 be restored unto the knowledge of <331 fathers,
and also to the <9 of <26 Christ, <84 was had <26 <15
fathers.

30:6 And then <31 they rejoice; for they <5 know that it is a
blessing unto them from the hand of God; and <30 scales of darkness
<21 begin to fall from <10 eyes; and many generations <10 not
pass away <51 them, save they <9 be a pure and delightsome people.

30:7 And it <13 come to pass that the Jews <78 are scattered also
<12 <44 to <173 in Christ; and they <8 <8 to gather in
upon the face of the land; and as many as <16 <22 in <137 <4
also become a <53 <53

30:8 And it <13 come to pass that the Lord God <8 commence his
work <83 all nations, kindreds, tongues, and <458 to bring about
the restoration of his <336 upon the earth.

30:9 And with righteousness <31 the Lord God judge the poor, and
reprove with equity for the meek of the <25 And he <20 smite the
earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips <18
he slay the wicked.

30:10 For the time speedily cometh that the Lord God <19 cause a
great division <89 the <85 and the wicked will he destroy; and he
will spare his <13 yea, even if it so be that he must destroy the
<23 by fire.

30:11 And <100 <43 be the girdle of his loins, and
faithfulness the <8 of his reins.

30:12 And then <21 the wolf dwell with the lamb; and the leopard
<11 lie down with the kid, and the calf, and the young lion, and the
fatling, together; and a little child <22 lead them.

30:13 And the cow and the bear <13 feed; <288 <27 ones <5 lie
down <27 and the lion <8 eat straw like the ox.

30:14 And the sucking <40 <14 play on the hole of the asp, and the
weaned <13 <13 put his hand on the cockatrice’s den.

30:15 They <13 not hurt nor <136 in all my holy mountain; for the
<209 <14 be full of the <406 of the Lord as the waters cover
the sea.

30:16 Wherefore, the things of all nations <26 be made known; yea,
all <11 <8 be made known unto the children of men.

30:17 There is nothing <369 is secret save it <21 be revealed; there
is no work of <424 save it <12 be made manifest in the light; and
<18 is <29 <29 is sealed upon the <85 save it <20 be
loosed.

30:18 <75 all <64 <19 have been revealed unto the <64
of men <21 at that day be <56 and Satan <8 have power over
the hearts of the <21 of men no more, for a long time. And now, my
beloved brethren, I make an end of my sayings.

2 Nephi Chapter 31

31:1 And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my
<34 brethren. And I cannot write but a few things, <84 I know
must surely come to pass; neither can I <17 but a few of the words of
my brother Jacob.

31:2 <115 the <115 <31 I have written sufficeth me, save it
be a few <25 <13 I must speak concerning the doctrine of Christ;
wherefore, I <122 <10 unto you plainly, according to the plainness
of my prophesying.

31:3 For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth
the Lord God work <442 the <148 of men. For the Lord God giveth
light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men <48 to
<359 language, unto <3 understanding.

31:4 <93 I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto
you <87 that prophet <94 the Lord showed unto me, that <19
baptize the Lamb of God, <14 <8 take away the sins of the world.

31:5 And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, <22 have need to be
baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more
need have we, <24 unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!

31:6 And now, I <90 ask of you, my <228 <262 wherein the Lamb
of God did <42 all righteousness in <34 <51 by water?

31:7 Know ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he <18 <76
he showeth unto the <165 of men that, <151 to the flesh he
humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that
he <66 be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.

31:8 <171 <213 he was <64 with water the Holy Ghost
descended upon him in the form of a dove.

31:9 And again, it <66 unto the <66 of men the straightness of
the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by <186 they <165 enter,
he having set the example <80 them.

31:10 And he said unto the <37 of men: Follow thou me. <73
my <150 <150 can we follow Jesus save we <320 be willing to
keep the commandments of the Father?

31:11 And the <118 said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be <105 in the
name of my Beloved Son.

31:12 And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that is
<28 in my name, to him will the <44 give the Holy Ghost, like
unto me; <392 <75 me, and do the <422 <115 ye have seen me
do.

31:13 <99 my <98 <98 I know that if ye <97 <27
the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no
deception <142 God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins,
witnessing unto the <67 that ye are <130 to take upon you the
name of Christ, by baptism—yea, by following your Lord and your Savior
down into the <348 <272 to his word, behold, then <65 ye
receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the
Holy <13 and then can ye <505 with the tongue of angels, and shout
praises unto the Holy One of Israel.

31:14 But, <47 my <119 <119 thus came the <173 of the Son
unto me, <173 After ye have repented of your <105 and witnessed
unto the <106 that ye are <106 to keep my commandments, by the
<73 of <93 and have received the <7 of fire and of the Holy
<196 and can <78 with a new tongue, yea, even with the <84 of
<85 and <361 this <316 deny me, it <381 have been better for
you that ye had not known me.

31:15 And I heard a <91 from the <414 <88 Yea, the words of my
<284 are true and faithful. He that endureth to the end, the same
<168 be saved.

31:16 And now, my <131 <131 I know by this that unless a man
<21 endure to the end, in <212 the <388 of the Son of the
living God, he cannot be <39

31:17 <288 do the <303 <303 I have told you I have seen that
your Lord and your Redeemer <115 do; for, for this cause have they
been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by <35 ye <22
enter. For the gate by <9 ye <9 enter is repentance and <178
by water; and then <266 a remission of your sins by fire and by the
Holy Ghost.

31:18 And then are ye in this strait and narrow path <41 leads to
eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done
<327 to the <479 of the <255 and the Son; and ye have
<246 the Holy <239 <36 witnesses of the <16 and the Son,
unto the fulfilling of the promise <15 he hath made, that if ye
<50 in by the way ye <104 receive.

31:19 And now, my <199 <199 <263 ye have gotten into this
<87 and <87 path, I <269 ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto
you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of
Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of
him who is mighty to save.

31:20 <228 ye must press forward with a steadfastness in <472
having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.
<27 if ye <283 <28 forward, feasting upon the word of <29
and <293 to the end, <442 thus saith the Father: Ye <21 have
<189 life.

31:21 And now, <17 my <129 <129 this is the way; and there
is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved
in the kingdom of God. And now, <33 this is the doctrine of <63
and the only and true <9 of the <407 and of the Son, and of
the Holy <225 <210 is one God, without end. Amen.

2 Nephi Chapter 32

32:1 And now, <47 my <80 <80 I suppose that ye ponder
somewhat in your hearts concerning that <36 ye <234 do <225 ye
have <246 in by the way. But, <30 why do ye <26 these <403
in your hearts?

32:2 Do ye not remember that I said unto you that <35 ye had <307
the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels? And now, how
<11 ye <12 with the <12 of angels save it were by the Holy
Ghost?

32:3 Angels <19 by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they <10
the words of Christ. <227 I said unto you, feast upon the <11
of Christ; for <95 the <7 of <294 will tell you all <98
what ye <120 do.

32:4 <32 now <91 I have spoken <115 words, if ye cannot
understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock;
<66 ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the
dark.

32:5 For <65 again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the
way, and receive the Holy <231 it will show unto you all <83 what
ye <83 do.

32:6 <414 this is the <265 of <274 and <306 will be no more
<10 <305 until <98 he <337 manifest himself unto you in the
flesh. And when he <12 <12 <12 unto you in the flesh, the
<51 <253 he <13 say unto you <4 ye observe to do.

32:7 And now I, Nephi, <134 say more; the Spirit stoppeth mine
utterance, and I am left to mourn <142 of the unbelief, and the
wickedness, and the ignorance, and the stiffneckedness of men; for they
will not search knowledge, nor <171 great <4 when it is
<92 unto them in plainness, even as plain as word can be.

32:8 And now, my <351 <351 I perceive that ye <325 still in
your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must <266 <359 this
thing. For if ye would hearken unto the <92 <116 teacheth a man to
pray ye <13 know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit <17 not
a man to pray, but <8 him that he must not pray.

32:9 But <233 I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not
faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the
first place ye <179 pray unto the Father in the name of <230 that
he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy <5 may
be for the welfare of thy soul.

2 <498 <498 33

33:1 And now I, <212 <212 write all the <236 <120 were taught
among my people; <347 am I mighty in writing, like unto speaking;
for when a man speaketh by the <430 of the Holy <471 the <6 of the
Holy <7 carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men.

33:2 But <133 <322 are many that harden their <18 against the
Holy Spirit, that it hath no <121 in them; <406 they cast many
<77 away <78 are written and esteem them as <9 of naught.

33:3 But I, <100 have <16 what I have written, and I <21 it as
of <285 worth, and especially unto my people. For I pray continually
for them by day, and mine eyes water my pillow by night, <334 of
<65 and I cry unto my God in faith, and I know that he will hear my
cry.

33:4 And I know that the Lord God will <203 my prayers for the
gain of my <61 And the words <101 I have <86 in weakness will
be made strong unto <56 for it persuadeth them to do good; it maketh
known unto them of <149 fathers; and it <189 of Jesus, and
<21 them to believe in him, and to endure to the end, <48 is
life eternal.

33:5 And it <28 harshly <181 sin, according to the plainness of
the truth; <179 no man will be angry at the <80 <32 I have
<81 save he <317 be of the <373 of the devil.

33:6 I glory in plainness; I <4 in <36 I <4 in my <78 for
he hath redeemed my soul from hell.

33:7 I have charity for my people, and <203 faith in Christ that I
<52 meet many souls spotless at his judgment-seat.

33:8 I have <26 for the Jew—I say Jew, <206 I mean them from
whence I came.

33:9 I also have <22 for the Gentiles. But <308 for none of
these can I hope except they <52 be reconciled unto <416 and enter
into the narrow gate, and walk in the strait path <129 leads to life,
and continue in the path until the end of the day of probation.

33:10 And now, my beloved brethren, and also Jew, and all ye ends of
the earth, hearken unto <64 <171 and <213 in Christ; and if ye
<7 not in <13 <13 <5 in Christ. And if ye <79 <7
in <139 ye will <6 in <17 words, for they are the <22 of
<93 and he hath given them unto me; and they teach all men that
they should do good.

33:11 And if they are not the <32 of <31 judge ye—for <48 will
show unto you, with <478 and <199 glory, that they are his <57 at
the last day; and you and I <77 stand face to face before his bar;
and ye <11 know that I have been commanded of him to write <90
things, notwithstanding my weakness.

33:12 And I pray the Father in the name of <66 that many of us, if
not all, may be saved in his kingdom at that <74 and last day.

33:13 And now, my <182 <182 all those who are of the house of
Israel, and all ye ends of the <188 I speak unto you as the voice of
one crying from the dust: Farewell <231 that <47 day <96 come.

33:14 And you that will not partake of the goodness of God, and respect
the <158 of the Jews, and also my <145 and the <10 <277 <33
proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lamb of God, <320 I bid you an
everlasting farewell, for <140 <25 <24 condemn you at the last
day.

33:15 For what I seal on <94 <18 be brought <471 you at the
judgment bar; for thus hath the Lord <180 me, and I must obey.
Amen.




 THE BOOK OF JACOB

THE BROTHER OF NEPHI

The <67 of his preaching unto his brethren. He confoundeth a man who
seeketh to overthrow the doctrine of <330 A few <22 concerning the
history of the people of Nephi.

Jacob Chapter 1

1:1 For <120 it came to pass that fifty and five years had passed
away from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; wherefore, Nephi gave me,
Jacob, a commandment <49 the small plates, upon <168 <146
things are engraven.

1:2 And he gave me, <22 a <22 that I <369 <306 upon <21
plates a few of the <26 <30 I consider to be most precious; that I
<21 not touch, save it were lightly, <52 the <100 of this
<101 <24 are called the <5 of <106

1:3 For he said that the <21 of his <15 <34 be engraven upon
his other <83 and that I <11 preserve <65 <64 and hand them
down unto my seed, from generation to generation.

1:4 And if there were <183 <56 was sacred, or revelation <5
was great, or prophesying, that I <38 <48 the heads of them
upon <44 <51 and touch upon them as much as it were possible, for
Christ’s sake, and for the sake of our people.

1:5 For because of faith and <365 anxiety, it truly had been made
manifest unto us <127 our people, what <149 <56 happen unto
them.

1:6 And we also had many revelations, and the spirit of much prophecy;
<214 we knew of <471 and his kingdom, <94 <31 <410

1:7 Wherefore we labored diligently among our <46 that we might
persuade them to come unto Christ, and <423 of the <423 of God,
that they <18 enter into his rest, lest by any means he <43 swear
in his wrath they <7 not <18 in, as in the provocation in the
days of temptation while the children of Israel were in the wilderness.

1:8 Wherefore, we would to God that we could <68 all men not to
rebel <424 God, to provoke him to anger, but that all men <24
believe in <85 and view his death, and suffer his cross and bear
the shame of the world; <133 I, <322 take it upon me to fulfil
the <329 of my brother <289

1:9 Now <367 began to be old, and he saw that he must soon die;
<35 he anointed a man to be a king and a ruler over his <310
now, according to the reigns of the kings.

1:10 The <15 having loved <46 exceedingly, he <5 been a <244
protector for them, <8 wielded the sword of Laban in their defence,
and <11 <206 in all his days for <11 welfare—

1:11 <149 the <40 were desirous to retain in remembrance his
name. And whoso <190 reign in his stead were <400 by the <237
second Nephi, third <2 and so forth, <82 to the <82 of the
kings; and thus they were <24 by the <24 let them be of whatever
name they would.

1:12 And it came to pass that <102 died.

1:13 Now the <73 <303 were not Lamanites were Nephites;
nevertheless, they were <42 Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites,
Zoramites, Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites.

1:14 But I, <202 shall not hereafter distinguish them by <414 names,
but I <11 call them <38 that seek to destroy the <48 of
<98 and those who are friendly to <66 I <21 call <50 or
the <18 of <17 <112 to the <112 of the <194

1:15 And now it came to pass that the <22 of <22 under the <153
of the <147 king, <254 to grow hard in <185 hearts, and indulge
themselves somewhat in wicked practices, such as like unto David of old
desiring many wives and concubines, and also Solomon, his son.

1:16 Yea, and they also <41 to search much gold and silver, and <8
to be lifted up <44 in pride.

1:17 <456 I, <136 gave unto them <133 words as I taught them in
the temple, <265 first obtained mine errand from the Lord.

1:18 For I, <28 and my <357 Joseph had been consecrated priests
and teachers of this <233 by the hand of <372

1:19 And we did magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the
responsibility, answering the sins of the <147 upon our own heads if
we did not teach them the word of God with all diligence; <396 by
laboring with our might <157 blood <3 not come upon our garments;
otherwise <10 <10 <471 come upon our garments, and we <7 not be
found spotless at the last day.

Jacob Chapter 2

2:1 The <133 <301 <112 the <111 of <217 spake unto the <76
of <7 after the death of Nephi:

2:2 Now, my beloved brethren, I, <26 <261 to the responsibility
<33 I am <247 to God, to <124 mine <124 with soberness, and
that I <88 rid my garments of your sins, I come up into the temple
this day that I <18 declare unto you the word of God.

2:3 And ye yourselves know that I have hitherto been diligent in the
<50 of my calling; but I this day am weighed down with much more
desire and anxiety for the welfare of your souls than I have <33
been.

2:4 For behold, as yet, ye have been obedient unto the word of the
<219 <108 I have given unto you.

2:5 But <25 hearken ye unto me, and know that by the help of the
all-powerful Creator of heaven and earth I can tell you concerning your
thoughts, how that ye are beginning to labor in sin, <48 sin
appeareth very abominable unto me, yea, and <5 unto God.

2:6 Yea, it grieveth my soul and causeth me to shrink with shame before
the presence of my Maker, that I must testify unto you <55 the
wickedness of your hearts.

2:7 And also it <37 me that I must use so much boldness of speech
<26 you, <41 your <439 and your children, many of whose
feelings are exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate <18 God,
<91 thing is pleasing unto God;

2:8 And it supposeth me that they have come up hither to hear the
<21 word of God, yea, the word <31 healeth the wounded soul.

2:9 Wherefore, it burdeneth my soul that I should be constrained,
because of the strict commandment <25 I have received from God, to
admonish you <318 to your crimes, to enlarge the wounds of those
who are already wounded, instead of consoling and healing <397 wounds;
and <15 who have not been <15 <15 of feasting upon the
<78 word of God have daggers placed to pierce <25 <277 and
wound <5 <121 minds.

2:10 But, notwithstanding the greatness of the task, I must do
<68 to the <83 commands of God, and tell you <167 your
<193 and abominations, in the <211 of the pure in heart, and
the broken <5 and <408 the glance of the piercing eye of the
Almighty God.

2:11 <140 I must tell you the truth <53 to the plainness of
the word of God. For <326 as I inquired of the <344 thus came the
word unto me, saying: <466 get thou up into the <438 on the morrow,
and <437 the word <172 I shall give thee unto this people.

2:12 And now <44 my <499 this is the word <21 I <26 unto
you, that many of you have begun to search for gold, and for silver,
and for all manner of precious ores, in the <29 this land, <3 is a
land of promise unto you and to your seed, doth abound most
plentifully.

2:13 And the hand of providence hath smiled upon you most pleasingly,
that you have obtained many riches; and <271 some of you have
<10 more abundantly than that of your brethren ye are lifted up in
the pride of your hearts, and wear stiff necks and high heads <32
of the costliness of your apparel, and persecute your <30 <12
ye suppose that ye are better than they.

2:14 And now, my <139 do ye <17 that God justifieth you in
this thing? Behold, I say unto you, Nay. But he condemneth you, and if
ye persist in these things his judgments must speedily come unto you.

2:15 O that he would show you that he can <323 you, and with one
<273 of his eye he can smite you to the dust!

2:16 O that he <30 rid you from this iniquity and abomination. And, O
that ye <13 listen unto the word of his commands, and let not this
<140 of your hearts destroy your souls!

2:17 Think of your <132 like unto yourselves, and be familiar with
all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you.

2:18 But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.

2:19 And after ye have <217 a hope in Christ ye <321 obtain
<25 if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do
good—to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the
captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.

2:20 And now, my <218 I have spoken unto you <463 pride; and
those of you <333 have afflicted your neighbor, and persecuted him
<257 ye were proud in your <283 of the <220 <19 God hath
given you, what say ye of it?

2:21 Do ye not <265 that such <22 are abominable unto him who
created all flesh? And the one being is as <396 in his sight as the
other. And all flesh is of the dust; and for the selfsame end hath he
<32 them, that they should keep his commandments and glorify him
forever.

2:22 And now I make an end of speaking unto you <113 this pride.
And were it not that I must speak unto you <14 a grosser crime,
my heart <271 rejoice exceedingly <121 of you.

2:23 But the word of God burdens me <14 of your <25 crimes. For
behold, thus saith the Lord: This people begin to wax in iniquity; they
understand not the scriptures, for they seek to excuse themselves in
committing whoredoms, <35 of the <142 <164 were written
<67 David, and Solomon his son.

2:24 <416 David and <10 truly had many wives and concubines,
<25 thing was <169 <301 me, <61 the Lord.

2:25 Wherefore, thus <9 the Lord, I have led this <73 forth out
of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm, that I might raise
up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.

2:26 <47 I the Lord God will not suffer that this <48 <342
do like unto them of old.

2:27 <23 my <306 hear me, and hearken to the word of the
<149 For there <28 not any man among you have save it be one wife;
and concubines he <16 have none;

2:28 For I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women. And
whoredoms are an abomination <135 me; thus <127 the Lord of Hosts.

2:29 <68 this <83 <39 keep my commandments, <16 the Lord
of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes.

2:30 For if I will, <22 the Lord of <21 <145 up seed unto me, I
will command my people; otherwise they <44 <110 unto these things.

2:31 For <265 I, the <194 have seen the sorrow, and heard the
mourning of the daughters of my <73 in the land of <201 yea,
and in all the lands of my people, <271 of the wickedness and
abominations of <80 husbands.

2:32 And I will not suffer, <81 the Lord of <81 that the cries of
the fair <50 of this <35 <277 I have led out of the land of
<56 <90 come up unto me against the men of my <22 <38
the Lord of <158

2:33 For they <23 not lead away captive the <44 of my <94
<80 of <74 tenderness, save I <17 visit them with a sore curse,
even unto destruction; for they <13 not commit <374 like unto
them of old, <52 the Lord of <51

2:34 And now <154 my <279 ye know that <167 <491 were
given to our father, Lehi; wherefore, ye have known them before; and ye
have come unto great condemnation; for ye have done <27 <422 <120
ye ought not to have done.

2:35 <420 ye have done greater iniquities than the Lamanites, our
brethren. Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives, and lost the
confidence of your children, <116 of your bad examples <304 them;
and the sobbings of <126 <26 ascend up to God <163 you. And
<22 of the strictness of the word of God, <72 cometh down <16
you, many <25 died, pierced with deep wounds.

Jacob Chapter 3

3:1 But <131 I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in heart.
Look unto God with firmness of mind, and pray unto him with exceeding
faith, and he will console you in your afflictions, and he will plead
your cause, and send down justice upon those who seek your destruction.

3:2 O all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and receive the
pleasing word of God, and feast upon his love; for ye may, if your
minds are firm, forever.

3:3 But, wo, wo, unto you that are not pure in <42 that are filthy
this day <163 God; for except ye repent the land is <450 for your
sakes; and the <205 <154 are not <24 like unto you,
nevertheless they are <19 with a sore cursing, <298 scourge you
even unto <100

3:4 And the time speedily cometh, that <47 ye <47 they <21
possess the land of your inheritance, and the Lord God will lead away
the righteous out from among you.

3:5 <277 the Lamanites your <326 whom ye hate <234 of <246
filthiness and the cursing <79 hath come upon <10 skins, are more
<34 than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment of the
Lord, <23 was <355 unto our father—that they should have save it
were one wife, and concubines they <11 have none, and there <5
not be whoredoms committed <74 them.

3:6 And now, this <43 they observe to keep; <391 <75
of this observance, in keeping this commandment, the Lord God will not
destroy them, but will be merciful unto <347 and one day they <136
become a blessed people.

3:7 <120 <101 husbands love <3 <382 and <3 wives love <3
husbands; and <4 <13 and <3 <10 love <3 children; and
<4 unbelief and <3 hatred towards you is <69 of the iniquity
of <11 fathers; <78 how much better are you than they, in the
sight of your <471 Creator?

3:8 O my <178 I fear that unless ye <78 <217 of your sins that
<37 skins will be whiter than yours, when ye <16 be brought with
them <290 the throne of God.

3:9 Wherefore, a <144 I give unto you, <187 is the word of God,
that ye revile no more <452 them <88 of the darkness of <50
skins; neither <45 ye <16 <14 them <14 of <11
filthiness; but ye <12 remember your own filthiness, and <5
that <14 <259 came <19 of <5 fathers.

3:10 <62 ye <22 <17 your children, how that ye have
grieved <18 <504 <22 of the example that ye have set <93
<200 and also, <24 that ye may, <17 of your <50 bring
your children unto destruction, and <30 sins be heaped upon your
<455 at the last day.

3:11 O my <159 hearken unto my words; arouse the faculties of your
souls; shake yourselves that ye may awake from the slumber of death;
and loose <13 from the pains of hell that ye may not <265
angels to the devil, to be cast into that lake of fire and brimstone
<168 is the second death.

3:12 And now I, Jacob, spake many more things unto the people of Nephi,
warning them <167 fornication and lasciviousness, and every kind of
sin, telling them the awful consequences of <366

3:13 And a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, <56 now
began to be numerous, cannot be written upon these plates; but many of
<144 <22 are <11 upon the larger plates, and <9 wars,
and <4 contentions, and the reigns of <6 kings.

3:14 These plates are called the <4 of <93 and they were made by
the hand of Nephi. And I make an end of speaking <56 words.

Jacob Chapter 4

4:1 Now behold, it came to pass that I, <38 having ministered much
unto my <131 in word, (and I <92 write but a little of my words,
<246 of the difficulty of engraving our words upon plates) and we
know that the <164 <125 we <27 upon <82 must remain;

4:2 But whatsoever <14 we <13 upon anything save it be upon <18
must perish and vanish away; but we can <17 a few <45 upon <138
<39 will give our <332 and also our beloved <282 a small
degree of knowledge concerning us, or <3 <148 fathers—

4:3 Now in this thing we do rejoice; and we labor diligently to
engraven <137 <45 upon <45 hoping that our <39 brethren and
our <347 will receive them with thankful hearts, and look upon them
that they may learn with joy and not with sorrow, <440 with
contempt, <59 <59 first parents.

4:4 For, for this intent have we <236 <53 things, that they may
know that we knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his glory many
hundred years <428 his coming; and not only we ourselves had a hope
of his glory, but also all the holy prophets <138 were <23 us.

4:5 Behold, they believed in Christ and worshiped the Father in his
name, and also we worship the <10 in his name. And for this <82
we keep the law of Moses, it pointing our souls to him; and for this
cause it is sanctified unto us for righteousness, even as it was
accounted unto Abraham in the wilderness to be obedient unto the
commands of God in offering up his son Isaac, <85 is a similitude of
God and his Only Begotten Son.

4:6 Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many revelations and
the spirit of prophecy; and <332 all <165 witnesses we obtain a
hope, and our faith becometh unshaken, insomuch that we truly can
command in the name of Jesus and the very trees obey us, or the
mountains, or the waves of the sea.

4:7 Nevertheless, the Lord God showeth us our weakness that we may know
that it is by his grace, and his great condescensions unto the <275
of men, that we have power to do <79 things.

4:8 <197 <21 and marvelous are the works of the Lord. How
unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is
impossible that man should find out all his ways. And no man knoweth of
his ways save it be revealed unto him; wherefore, <383 despise not
the <149 of God.

4:9 For <489 by the <74 of his word man came upon the face of the
earth, <198 earth was created by the <19 of his word. <192 if
God being able to speak and the world was, and to <7 and man was
created, O then, why not able to <181 the <39 or the workmanship
of his hands upon the face of it, according to his will and pleasure?

4:10 <51 <91 seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take
<7 from his hand. For <94 ye yourselves know that he
counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in <170 mercy, over all his
works.

4:11 <43 <479 <44 be reconciled unto him through the
atonement of <433 his Only <307 Son, and ye may <284 a
resurrection, <77 to the <125 of the resurrection <135 is in
<23 and be presented as the first-fruits of <418 unto God, <315
faith, and obtained a good hope of <468 in him <443 he manifesteth
himself in the flesh.

4:12 And now, beloved, marvel not that I tell you <267 things; for why
not <165 of the <78 of <55 and attain to a perfect knowledge
of him, as to <10 to the <9 of a <78 and the <195
to come?

4:13 <301 my <119 he that prophesieth, let him prophesy to the
understanding of men; for the Spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not.
<144 it <9 of things as they really are, and of <7 as
they <8 will be; <296 <84 <9 are manifested unto us
plainly, for the salvation of our souls. But <204 we are not
<449 alone in <23 <107 for God also spake them unto prophets
of old.

4:14 But <25 the Jews were a stiffnecked people; and they despised
the words of plainness, and killed the <503 and sought for <61
that they could not understand. <88 because of their blindness,
<207 blindness came by looking beyond the mark, they must needs fall;
for God hath taken away his plainness from them, and delivered unto
them many <41 <29 they cannot understand, <38 they desired it.
And <6 they <6 it God hath done it, that they may stumble.

4:15 And now I, Jacob, am led on by the <166 unto prophesying; for I
perceive by the workings of the <12 <48 is in me, that by the
stumbling of the Jews they will reject the stone upon <18 they might
build and have safe foundation.

4:16 But <144 <324 to the scriptures, this <22 shall become
the great, and the last, and the only sure foundation, upon <35 the
Jews can build.

4:17 And now, my <309 how is it possible that these, after <343
rejected the sure <28 can ever <60 upon it, that it may
<49 the head of <173 corner?

4:18 <295 my <415 <296 I will unfold this mystery unto you;
if I do not, by any means, get shaken from my firmness in the Spirit,
and stumble <167 of my over anxiety for you.

Jacob Chapter 5

5:1 <47 my <46 do ye not remember to have read the <257 of
the prophet Zenos, <110 he <289 unto the house of Israel, saying:

5:2 Hearken, O ye <11 of <11 and hear the <28 of me, a <28
of the Lord.

5:3 For <167 thus saith the Lord, I will liken thee, O <30 of
<31 like unto a tame olive-tree, <55 a man took and nourished in
his vineyard; and it grew, and waxed old, and began to decay.

5:4 And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard went forth, and
he saw that his olive-tree <27 to decay; and he said: I will prune
it, and dig about it, and nourish it, that perhaps it may shoot forth
young and tender branches, and it perish not.

5:5 And it came to pass that he pruned it, and digged <35 it, and
<91 it <283 to his word.

5:6 And it came to pass that <257 many days it <72 to put <52
somewhat a little, <55 and <55 branches; but <148 the main top
thereof <19 to perish.

5:7 And it came to pass that the <118 of the <118 saw it, and he
said unto his servant: It grieveth me that I should lose this tree;
wherefore, go and pluck the branches from a wild <182 and bring
them hither unto me; and we will <17 off those main <19 <197
are beginning to wither away, and we will cast them into the fire that
they may be burned.

5:8 And <94 <241 the Lord of the vineyard, I take away many of
these <113 and <113 <168 and I will graft them whithersoever I
will; and it mattereth not that if it so be that the root of this tree
will perish, I may preserve the fruit <139 unto myself; <104 I
will take <45 <45 and <45 <45 and I will <45 them
<46 I will.

5:9 Take thou the <106 of the wild <125 and <19 them in,
in the stead thereof; and <36 <121 I have plucked off I will cast
into the fire and burn them, that they may not cumber the ground of my
vineyard.

5:10 And it came to pass that the servant of the Lord of the <209
did <266 to the word of the Lord of the <144 and grafted in
the <77 of the wild olive-tree.

5:11 And the Lord of the <32 caused that it <230 be <308
about, and pruned, and nourished, saying unto his <248 It <248
me that I <19 lose this <249 <144 that <359 I might
<156 the roots <156 that they <357 not, that I <12 <11
them unto myself, I have done this thing.

5:12 Wherefore, go thy way; watch the tree, and <399 it, <97
to my words.

5:13 And <154 will I place in the nethermost part of my <108
<191 I will, it <235 not unto thee; and I do it that I
may <62 unto myself the natural <125 of the <88 and also,
that I may lay up <244 <88 against the season, unto <247 for it
<115 me that I <114 lose this tree and the <20 thereof.

5:14 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <159 went his way,
and hid the <57 <57 of the tame olive-tree in the <91
parts of the <92 some in one and some in another, <120 to
his will and pleasure.

5:15 And it came to pass that a long time passed <399 and the Lord of
the <57 said unto his <204 Come, let us go down into the
<49 that we may labor in the <286

5:16 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <22 and also the
servant, went down into the <45 to labor. And it came to pass that
the <310 said unto his master: Behold, look here; behold the tree.

5:17 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <36 looked and
beheld the tree in the <381 the wild olive <142 had been grafted;
and it had sprung forth and begun to bear fruit. And he <26 that it
was good; and the <192 <212 was like unto the <174 <18

5:18 And he said unto the <132 <76 the <45 of the wild
tree have taken hold of the moisture of the root thereof, that the root
<39 hath brought <59 much strength; and because of the much
strength of the root <16 the wild <39 have <19 <19 tame
<58 Now, if we had not <424 in <330 branches, the tree <21
would have perished. And now, behold, I shall lay up much fruit, <120
the tree <18 hath <36 forth; and the <101 <7 I <18 lay
up <318 the <318 unto mine own self.

5:19 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <167 said unto the
<117 <249 let us go to the <301 part of the <229 and
<203 if the <145 <93 of the tree have not <61 <97 much
<61 <382 that I may lay up of the <9 <70 <65 the <65
unto mine own <66

5:20 And it came to pass that they went <34 whither the master had
hid the <50 <50 of the <476 and he said unto the <77
Behold these; and he <225 the first that it had <65 <31 much
fruit; and he <13 also that it was good. And he said unto the
<31 Take of the <75 <212 and lay it up <79 the <79
that I may <488 it unto mine own self; for <182 said he, this
long time have I nourished it, and it hath <57 <57 much <218

5:21 And it came to pass that the <358 said unto his <358 How
comest thou hither to plant this <103 or this branch of the tree? For
<51 it was the poorest spot in all the land of thy <428

5:22 And the Lord of the <210 said unto him: Counsel me not; I knew
that it was a poor spot of ground; wherefore, I said unto thee, I have
<90 it this long time, and thou beholdest that it hath <96
<97 much <97

5:23 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <56 said unto his
<158 Look hither; <255 I have planted another <97 of the tree
also; and thou knowest that this spot of ground was poorer than the
first. But, <26 the <484 I have <69 it this long <69 and it
hath <67 <66 much <219 therefore, gather it, and lay it up
<203 the <203 that I may <202 it unto mine own <286

5:24 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <86 said again unto
his <87 Look hither, and <62 <85 <85 <331 <404 I have
planted; <9 that I have <70 it <12 and it hath <67
<68 <133

5:25 And he said unto the <36 Look <221 and <27 the last.
Behold, this have I <129 in a good spot of <185 and I have
<42 it this long <112 and only a part of the tree hath <49
<49 tame <473 and the other part of the tree hath <13 <12
wild <130 <260 I have <34 this tree like unto the others.

5:26 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <120 said unto the
<83 Pluck off the <408 that have not <42 <42 good <54
and cast them into the fire.

5:27 But <53 the <337 said unto him: Let us prune it, and dig
about it, and nourish it a little longer, that perhaps it may bring
<42 good <413 unto <300 that thou canst lay it up <213 the
season.

5:28 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <85 and the <57
of the Lord of the <10 did <52 all the <42 of the <375

5:29 And it came to pass that a long time had passed away, and the Lord
of the <31 said unto his <125 Come, let us go down into the
vineyard, that we may labor <262 in the <44 For <120 the time
draweth near, and the end soon cometh; <404 I must lay up <65
<100 the <313 unto mine own <308

5:30 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <62 and the <103
went down into the vineyard; and they came to the tree whose natural
<198 had been broken off, and the wild <8 had been grafted
in; and <296 all sorts of <61 did cumber the <400

5:31 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <57 did taste of the
<235 every sort according to its number. And the Lord of the <18
said: <336 this long time have we <293 this tree, and I have
laid up unto myself <116 the season much <375

5:32 But <144 this time it hath <285 <243 much <50 and there
is none of it <415 is good. And <20 <11 are all kinds of bad
<346 and it profiteth me nothing, notwithstanding all our labor; and
now it grieveth me that I should lose this <112

5:33 And the Lord of the <89 said unto the <226 What shall we
do unto the <90 that I may <508 <225 good <145 thereof unto
mine own self?

5:34 And the <193 said unto his master: <123 because thou didst
graft in the <182 of the wild olive-tree they have <132 the
roots, that they are alive and they have not perished; wherefore thou
beholdest that they are yet <114

5:35 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <88 said unto his
<89 The tree <124 me <124 and the roots <82 profit me
nothing so long as it <105 <410 <166 evil <180

5:36 Nevertheless, I know that the <24 are good, and for mine own
purpose I have preserved them; and <101 of their much strength they
have hitherto <202 forth, from the wild branches, good <40

5:37 But <200 the wild <119 have grown and have overrun the
<47 thereof; and <36 that the wild <15 have overcome the
<12 <83 it hath <40 <76 much evil <223 and <19 that
it hath <11 <11 so much evil <185 thou <138 that it
beginneth to perish; and it will soon become ripened, that it may be
cast into the fire, except we <243 do something for it to <220
it.

5:38 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <165 said unto his
<165 Let us go down into the nethermost parts of the <482 and
<402 if the <422 <97 have also <80 <80 evil <127

5:39 And it came to pass that they went down into the <33 <33
of the <508 And it came to pass that they beheld that the <110 of
the <43 <43 had <104 corrupt also; yea, the first and the
second and also the last; and they had all <18 corrupt.

5:40 And the wild <34 of the last had <172 that part of the tree
<403 <82 <82 good <415 even that the branch had withered away
and died.

5:41 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <136 wept, and said
unto the <138 What could I have done more for my vineyard?

5:42 <373 I knew that all the <68 of the <150 save it were
these, had <87 corrupted. And now these <71 have once <73
<74 good <22 have also <15 corrupted; and now all the trees of
my <62 are good for <349 save it be to be hewn down and cast
into the fire.

5:43 And <202 this last, whose <110 hath <110 away, I did plant
in a good spot of ground; yea, even that <64 was choice unto me above
all other <205 of the land of my <207

5:44 And thou beheldest that I also cut down that <29 cumbered this
spot of ground, that I might <50 this tree in the stead thereof.

5:45 And thou <30 that a part <366 <118 <117 good <191
and a part <9 <9 <9 wild <372 and <372 I plucked not
the <253 <13 and cast them into the <352 <419 they have
<231 the good <109 that it hath <111 away.

5:46 And now, <19 notwithstanding all the care <80 we have taken
of my <192 the <166 <41 have <175 corrupted, that they
<509 <60 no good <61 and <197 I had hoped to preserve, to have
laid up <200 <25 against the season, unto mine own self. But,
<50 they have <36 like unto the wild olive-tree, and they are of
no worth but to be hewn down and cast into the fire; and it grieveth me
that I <452 lose them.

5:47 But what <293 I have done more in my <293 Have I slackened
mine hand, that I have not nourished it, Nay, I have <5 it, and
I have digged about it, and I have pruned it, and I have dunged it; and
I have stretched <116 mine hand almost all the day long, and the end
draweth nigh. And it <77 me that I <76 hew down all the <150
of my <156 and cast them into the fire that they <18 be burned.
Who is it that has corrupted my <89

5:48 And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master: Is it
not the loftiness of thy vineyard—have not the <243 <177
<234 the roots <217 are good? And <259 the <12 have
<12 the <12 thereof, <360 they grew faster than the strength
of the roots, taking <6 unto themselves. <439 I say, is not
this the cause that the <97 of thy <412 have <213 corrupted?

5:49 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <18 said unto the
<490 Let us go to and hew down the <35 of the <17 and cast
them into the <326 that they shall not cumber the ground of my
<149 for I have done all. What <232 I have done more for my
<144

5:50 But, <288 the <140 said unto the Lord of the vineyard: Spare
it a little longer.

5:51 And the Lord said: Yea, I will spare it a <16 longer, for it
<218 me that I <200 lose the <84 of my <472

5:52 Wherefore, let us take of the <166 of <368 <175 I have
planted in the nethermost <500 of my <91 and let us graft them
into the tree from whence they came; and let us pluck from the tree
those <37 whose <394 is most bitter, and <26 in the natural
<12 of the tree in the <509 <509

5:53 And this will I do that the tree may not perish, that, perhaps, I
may preserve unto myself the <242 <259 for mine own purpose.

5:54 And, <148 the <13 of the <50 <49 of the tree <99 I
<98 whithersoever I would are yet alive; wherefore, that I may
<40 them also for mine own purpose, I will take of the <31 of
this tree, and I will <93 them in unto <450 Yea, I will <8 in
unto them the <22 of their mother <22 that I may <42 the
<68 also unto mine own self, that when they <256 be sufficiently
strong perhaps they may bring <435 good <143 unto me, and I may yet
have glory in the <12 of my <208

5:55 And it came to pass that they took from the <115 tree <112 had
<345 wild, and grafted in unto the <12 trees, <12 also had
<13 wild.

5:56 And they also took of the <18 <257 <18 had <16 <29 and
<30 into <99 <99 tree.

5:57 And the Lord of the <359 said unto the <375 Pluck not the
wild <123 from the <52 save it be <245 <38 are most bitter;
and in them ye <120 <147 according to that <14 I have said.

5:58 And we will nourish again the <67 of the <299 and we will
trim up the <47 thereof; and we will <295 from the <19 <49
<11 <37 are ripened, that must <267 and cast them into the
fire.

5:59 And this I do <282 <282 the <195 <276 may take <508
because of <113 goodness; and <5 of the change of the branches,
that the good may overcome the evil.

5:60 And <20 that I have preserved the <152 <63 and the
<42 thereof, and that I have <155 in the <14 <14 <102
into <48 <161 <260 and have <26 the <21 of <9 <9
<10 <72 <72 the <100 of my <168 may <255 <255 <26
good fruit; and that I may have joy <10 in the <255 of my <139
and, <28 that I may rejoice exceedingly that I have <46 the
<47 and the <61 of the first fruit—

5:61 <485 go to, and call servants, that we may labor diligently
with our might in the <44 that we may prepare the way, that I may
<73 <73 <63 the <103 fruit, <180 <3 <66 is good and
the most precious above all other fruit.

5:62 <52 let us go to and <49 with our <47 this last time,
for behold the end draweth nigh, and this is for the last time that I
<270 prune my <367

5:63 Graft in the branches; begin at the last that they may be first,
and that the <113 may be last, and dig about the <317 both old and
young, the <15 and the last; and the last and the <29 that all may
be nourished once <109 for the last time.

5:64 <96 dig <37 them, and <70 <3 and dung them once
more, for the last <100 for the end <98 nigh. And if it be so that
these last grafts <98 grow, and <155 <155 the <151 <154 then
<10 ye <171 the way for <42 that they may grow.

5:65 And as they <114 to grow ye <22 clear away the <225 <183
<36 <36 bitter <35 <409 to the <344 of the good and the
size <391 and ye <25 not <26 away the bad <364 all at once,
lest the <262 <8 should be too strong for the graft, and the
<449 <12 <27 <406 and I lose the <320 of my <188

5:66 For it grieveth me that I <32 lose the <17 of my vineyard;
wherefore ye <30 <56 away the bad <76 as the good <9 <123
that the root and the top may be equal in strength, until the good
<18 <421 the bad, and the bad be hewn down and cast into the
fire, that they cumber not the ground of my <55 and thus will I
sweep away the bad out of my <85

5:67 And the <149 of the <182 tree will I <110 in <235 into
the <10 tree;

5:68 And the <21 of the <11 tree will I <21 into the <7
<12 of the <22 and thus will I <187 them together again, that
they <92 <8 <195 the <21 <196 and they <8 be one.

5:69 And the bad <10 be cast away, yea, even out of all the land of
my <100 for behold, only this once will I <300 my <97

5:70 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sent his
servant; and the servant went and did as the Lord had commanded him,
and brought <444 servants; and they were few.

5:71 And the Lord of the <35 said unto them: Go to, and <454 in
the <499 with your might. For <74 this is the last time that I
<99 nourish my <88 for the end is nigh at hand, and the season
speedily cometh; and if ye <38 with your <492 with me ye <27 have
joy in the fruit <347 I <9 lay up unto myself against the time
<11 will soon come.

5:72 And it came to pass that the servants did go and <44 with their
mights; and the Lord of the <99 labored also with them; and they
did obey the commandments of the Lord of the <17 in all things.

5:73 And there began to be the <218 <73 <263 in the <107 and
the <9 <247 <15 to grow and thrive exceedingly; and the wild
<11 <11 to be plucked off and to be cast away; and they did keep
the root and the top <414 equal, <380 to the <456 thereof.

5:74 And thus they labored, with all diligence, <16 to the
<84 of the Lord of the <189 even <390 the bad had been
cast away out of the <13 and the Lord had preserved unto himself
that the <442 had become <95 the <90 fruit; and they became like
unto one body; and the fruits were equal; and the Lord of the <133
had <34 unto <34 the <27 <344 <188 was most precious
unto him from the beginning.

5:75 And it came to pass that when the Lord of the <34 saw that
his <157 was good, and that his <11 was no more corrupt, he
called up his servants, and said unto <305 Behold, for this last time
have we nourished my <184 and thou beholdest that I have done
<138 to my will; and I have <83 the <81 <81 that it
is <53 even like as it was in the <84 And blessed art thou;
for because ye have been diligent in laboring with me in my <156
and have kept my commandments, and have <394 unto me <154 the
<47 <47 that my <94 is no more corrupted, and the bad is
cast <470 behold ye <341 have joy with me <49 of the <122 of my
<464

5:76 For <404 for a long time will I lay up of the <21 of my
<47 unto mine own self <374 the season, <185 <404 <404
and for the last time have I <137 my <87 and pruned it, and
dug about it, and dunged it; wherefore I will lay up unto mine own self
of the <95 for a long time, <157 to that <45 I have spoken.

5:77 And when the time cometh that evil <72 <102 <124 come into my
<54 then will I cause the good and the bad to be gathered; and
the good will I preserve unto myself, and the bad will I cast away into
its own place. And then <46 the <510 and the end; and my <119
will I <44 to be burned with fire.

Jacob Chapter 6

6:1 And now, <156 my brethren, as I said unto you that I would
prophesy, <13 this is my prophecy—that the things <108 this
prophet Zenos spake, concerning the house of Israel, in the <13 he
likened them unto a tame olive-tree, must surely come to pass.

6:2 And the day that he <128 set his hand <131 the second time to
recover his people, is the day, yea, even the last <168 that the
servants of the Lord <28 go forth in his power, to nourish and prune
his <353 and after that the end soon cometh.

6:3 And how <333 are they who have labored diligently in his
<24 and how cursed are they who <43 be cast out into their own
place! And the world <12 be <156 with <156

6:4 And how merciful is our God unto us, for he remembereth the <132
of <133 both roots and branches; and he stretches <85 his hands
unto them all the day long; and they are a stiffnecked and a gainsaying
people; but as many as will not harden <66 hearts <61 be saved in
the kingdom of God.

6:5 Wherefore, my beloved <214 I beseech of you in words of
soberness that ye <218 repent, and come with full purpose of heart,
and cleave unto God as he cleaveth unto you. And while his arm of mercy
is extended towards you in the light of the day, <67 not your
hearts.

6:6 Yea, today, if ye will hear his voice, <17 not your hearts; for
why will ye die?

6:7 For <283 <199 ye have been <423 by the good word of God
all the day long, will ye bring <145 evil <414 that ye must be hewn
down and cast into the fire?

6:8 Behold, will ye reject these words? Will ye <5 the <123 of the
prophets; and will ye <10 all the <11 <324 have been spoken
<336 Christ, <67 so many have <8 <7 him; and deny
the good word of <15 and the power of God, and the gift of the Holy
Ghost, and quench the Holy Spirit, and make a mock of the great plan of
redemption, <51 hath been laid for you?

6:9 Know ye not that if ye will do <87 things, that the <49 of the
redemption and the resurrection, <30 is in <63 will <128 you to
stand with shame and awful guilt before the bar of God?

6:10 And according to the <36 of justice, for justice cannot be
denied, ye must go away into that lake of fire and brimstone, whose
flames are unquenchable, and <6 smoke ascendeth up forever and ever,
<62 lake of fire and brimstone is endless torment.

6:11 O then, my <301 <301 repent ye, and enter in at the strait
gate, and continue in the way <33 is narrow, until ye <338 obtain
eternal life.

6:12 O be wise; what can I say more?

6:13 Finally, I bid you farewell, <28 I <28 meet you <116 the
pleasing bar of God, <43 bar striketh the wicked with <131 dread and
fear. Amen.

Jacob Chapter 7

7:1 And now it came to pass <240 some years had passed away, there
came a man among the people of Nephi, <128 name was Sherem.

7:2 And it came to pass that he began to preach <23 the people, and
to declare unto them that <38 should be no Christ. And he preached
many things <83 were flattering unto the <474 and this he did that
he might overthrow the doctrine of <25

7:3 And he labored diligently that he <16 lead away the <493 of the
<56 insomuch that he did lead away many <420 and he knowing that
I, Jacob, had faith in Christ who <68 come, he sought much
opportunity that he <38 come unto me.

7:4 And he was learned, that he had a perfect knowledge of the language
of the <86 wherefore, he could use much flattery, and much <293 of
speech, <300 to the <7 of the devil.

7:5 And he had hope to shake me from the faith, notwithstanding the
many revelations and the many <134 <134 I had seen <428 <372
things; for I truly had seen angels, and they had ministered unto me.
And also, I had heard the voice of the Lord speaking unto me in very
word, from time to time; <84 I <84 not be shaken.

7:6 And it came to pass that he came unto me, and on this wise did he
speak unto me, saying: Brother <156 I have <150 much <149
that I <150 <15 unto you; for I have <65 and also know that thou
goest about much, preaching that <102 ye call the gospel, or the
<228 of <228

7:7 And ye have led away much of this <301 that they pervert the
right way of God, and keep not the law of Moses <40 is the <14 way;
and convert the law of <12 into the worship of a being <18 ye say
<391 come many hundred <355 hence. And now behold, I, Sherem, <324
unto you that this is blasphemy; for no man knoweth of such <182 for
he cannot tell of <197 to come. And <389 this manner did Sherem
contend against me.

7:8 But <42 the Lord God poured in his Spirit into my soul,
<322 that I did confound him in all his words.

7:9 And I said unto him: Deniest thou the <326 who <86 come? And he
said: If <402 <334 be a Christ, I would not deny him; but I know
that <15 is no <14 neither has been, nor ever will be.

7:10 And I said unto him: Believest thou the scriptures? And he said,
Yea.

7:11 And I said unto him: Then ye do not understand them; for they
<309 testify of <210 Behold, I say unto you that none of the
prophets have written, nor prophesied, save they have spoken <338
this <23

7:12 And this is not all—it has been made manifest unto me, for I have
<275 and seen; and it also has been made <16 unto me by the <406
of the Holy Ghost; <343 I know if <117 <132 be no atonement
made all mankind must be lost.

7:13 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Show me a sign by this
<43 of the Holy Ghost, in the <269 ye know so much.

7:14 And I said unto him: What am I that I <58 tempt God to show
unto thee a sign in the thing <32 thou knowest to be true? Yet thou
wilt deny it, because thou art of the <502 Nevertheless, not my will
be done; but if God <239 smite thee, let that be a sign unto thee that
he has power, both in heaven and in earth; and <489 that <265 <25
<318 And thy will, O Lord, be done, and not mine.

7:15 And it came to pass that when I, <465 had <200 these words,
the <124 of the Lord came upon him, <327 that he fell to the
earth. And it came to pass that he was nourished for the space of many
days.

7:16 And it came to pass that he said unto the people: Gather together
on the morrow, for I <86 die; <217 I desire to speak unto the
<485 before I <13 die.

7:17 And it came to pass that on the morrow the multitude were gathered
together; and he spake plainly unto them and denied the <447 <183 he
had taught them, and confessed the <378 and the <110 of the Holy
<235 and the ministering of angels.

7:18 And he <37 <37 unto <27 that he had been deceived by the
<29 of the <210 And he <18 of hell, and of eternity, and of
eternal punishment.

7:19 And he <453 I fear lest I have committed the unpardonable sin,
for I have lied unto God; for I <86 the <76 and said that I
believed the scriptures; and they <421 <421 of him. And <272 I
have thus lied unto God I greatly fear lest my case <146 be awful; but
I confess unto God.

7:20 And it came to pass that when he had said <240 words he could say
no more, and he gave up the ghost.

7:21 And when the <174 had witnessed that he <117 <27 <167 as
he was about to give up the ghost, they were astonished exceedingly;
<273 that the <144 of God came down upon <159 and they were
overcome that they fell to the <286

7:22 Now, this <393 was pleasing unto me, <319 for I had requested
it of my Father who was in heaven; for he had <510 my cry and answered
my prayer.

7:23 And it came to pass that peace and the love of God was restored
again among the people; and they searched the scriptures, and hearkened
no more to the <135 of this wicked man.

7:24 And it came to pass that many means were devised to reclaim and
restore the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; but it all was
vain, for they delighted in wars and bloodshed, and they had an <267
hatred against us, their brethren. And they sought by the <150 of
<10 arms to destroy us continually.

7:25 Wherefore, the <384 of Nephi did fortify <29 them with <20
arms, and with all <6 might, trusting in the God and rock of <9
salvation; <418 they became as yet, conquerors of <10 enemies.

7:26 And it came to pass that I, <182 began to be old; and the record
of this <57 being kept on the other plates of Nephi, <40 I
conclude this record, declaring that I have written according to the
best of my knowledge, by saying that the time passed away with us, and
also our lives <9 away like as it were unto us a dream, we <52 a
lonesome and a solemn people, wanderers, cast out from Jerusalem, born
in tribulation, in a wilderness, and hated of our brethren, <485
caused wars and contentions; <75 we did mourn out our days.

7:27 And I, <108 saw that I must soon go down to my grave; <24
I said unto my son Enos: Take <359 plates. And I told him the <365
<48 my brother <184 had commanded me, and he promised obedience unto
the commands. And I make an end of my writing upon <33 plates, <26
<6 has been small; and to the reader I bid farewell, hoping that
many of my brethren may read my words. Brethren, adieu.




 THE BOOK OF ENOS


1:1 Behold, it came to pass that I, Enos, knowing my father that he was
a just man—for he taught me in his language, and also in the nurture
and admonition of the Lord—and blessed be the name of my God for it—

1:2 And I will tell you of the wrestle <102 I had before God, <2 I
received a remission of my sins.

1:3 <74 I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the <416 <30 I
had often <465 my <83 speak concerning <378 life, and the joy of
the saints, sunk deep into my heart.

1:4 And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down <61 my Maker, and I
cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and
all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did
still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.

1:5 And there came a <15 unto me, saying: <175 thy sins are forgiven
thee, and thou shalt be blessed.

1:6 And I, <18 knew that God could not lie; <297 my guilt was
swept away.

1:7 And I said: Lord, how is it done?

1:8 And he said unto me: Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast
never <124 <156 nor seen. And many years pass away <9 he shall
manifest himself in the flesh; <57 go to, thy <30 hath made
thee whole.

1:9 Now, it came to pass that when I had <40 <336 <204 I <499 to
feel a desire for the welfare of my <423 the Nephites; <41
I did pour out my whole soul unto God for them.

1:10 And while I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the <155
of the Lord came into my mind again, <162 I will visit thy <375
according to their diligence in keeping my commandments. I have given
unto them this land, and it is a holy land; and I curse it not save it
be for the cause of iniquity; <81 I will <43 thy <43
<43 as I have said; and <47 transgressions will I bring down
with sorrow upon <10 own heads.

1:11 And after I, <219 had <134 <134 words, my <157 <135 to be
unshaken in the Lord; and I prayed unto him with many long strugglings
for my <144 the Lamanites.

1:12 And it came to pass that <42 I had <26 and labored with all
diligence, the Lord said unto me: I will grant unto thee <86 to
thy desires, because of thy faith.

1:13 And now <163 this was the <202 <413 I desired of him—that if
it should so be, that my people, the Nephites, <8 fall into
transgression, and by any means be destroyed, and the Lamanites <14
not be <8 that the Lord God would preserve a record of my
<33 the <243 even if it so be by the power of his holy arm,
that it might be brought forth at some future day unto the Lamanites,
that, perhaps, they <15 be <15 unto salvation—

1:14 For at the present our <150 were vain in restoring them to
the true <115 And they swore in <198 wrath <34 if it were
possible, they <78 destroy our records and us, and also all the
traditions of our fathers.

1:15 Wherefore, I knowing that the Lord God was able to <106 our
records, I cried unto him continually, for he had said unto me:
Whatsoever thing ye <407 ask in faith, believing that ye <7 receive
in the name of <438 ye <9 <9 it.

1:16 And I had <23 and I did cry unto God that he <83 <55 the
records; and he covenanted with me that he <12 <309 them <148 unto
the <190 in his own due time.

1:17 And I, <311 knew it <22 be <256 to the covenant <240 he
had made; wherefore my soul did rest.

1:18 And the Lord said unto me: Thy fathers have also required of me
this thing; and it <91 be done unto them <41 to <171 faith;
for <4 <358 was like unto thine.

1:19 And now it came to pass that I, <70 went about among the people
of Nephi, prophesying of things to come, and testifying of the <7
<81 I had <402 and seen.

1:20 And I bear <292 that the <31 of Nephi did seek diligently to
restore the <128 unto the true <67 in God. But our labors were
vain; <77 hatred was fixed, and they were led by <9 evil nature
that they became wild, and ferocious, and a bloodthirsty <336 full
of idolatry and filthiness; feeding upon beasts of prey; dwelling in
tents, and wandering <97 in the wilderness with a short skin girdle
<10 <42 loins and <3 heads shaven; and <4 skill was in the
bow, and in the cimeter, and the ax. And many of them did eat nothing
save it was raw meat; and they were continually seeking to <333 us.

1:21 And it came to pass that the <127 of <127 did till the land,
and raise all manner of grain, and of fruit, and flocks of herds, and
<5 of all <15 of cattle of every kind, and goats, and wild
<4 and also many horses.

1:22 And there were exceedingly many prophets <212 us. And the <56
were a stiffnecked <143 hard to understand.

1:23 And <23 was <98 save it was exceeding harshness, preaching
and <235 of wars, and contentions, and destructions, and
<106 reminding them of death, and the duration of eternity, and
the judgments and the power of God, and all these things—stirring them
up <26 to keep them in the fear of the Lord. I say <58 was
<59 <190 of <23 things, and <88 great plainness of
speech, <373 keep them from going down speedily to destruction. And
after this <130 do I write concerning them.

1:24 And I saw wars between the Nephites and <291 in the course of
my days.

1:25 And it came to pass that I began to be old, and an hundred and
seventy and nine years had passed away from the time that our father
Lehi left Jerusalem.

1:26 And I saw that I must soon go down to my grave, having been
wrought upon by the <136 of God that I must preach and prophesy unto
this <193 and declare the word <446 to the truth <406 is in
Christ. And I have declared it in all my days, and have rejoiced in it
above that of the world.

1:27 And I soon go to the place of my rest, <39 is with my Redeemer;
for I know that in him I <507 rest. And I rejoice in the day when my
mortal <12 put on immortality, and <5 stand before him; then <5
I see his face with pleasure, and he will say unto me: Come unto me, ye
blessed, <229 is a <62 prepared for you in the mansions of my
Father. Amen.




 THE BOOK OF JAROM


1:1 Now behold, I, Jarom, <237 a few words <141 to the
commandment of my father, Enos, that our genealogy may be kept.

1:2 And as <287 plates are small, and as <6 things are written for
the intent of the benefit of our brethren the Lamanites, wherefore, it
must needs be that I <55 a little; but I <119 not <7 the <32
of my prophesying, nor of my revelations. For what could I <15 more
than my fathers have written? For have not they revealed the plan of
salvation? I say unto you, Yea; and this sufficeth me.

1:3 Behold, it is expedient that much should be done <461 this <261
because of the hardness of their hearts, and the deafness of <6
ears, and the blindness of <7 minds, and the stiffness of <6
necks; nevertheless, God is <410 merciful unto them, and has not
as yet swept them off from the face of the land.

1:4 And <214 are many <61 us who have many revelations, for they are
not all stiffnecked. And as many as are not stiffnecked and have faith,
have communion with the Holy Spirit, <302 maketh manifest unto the
children of men, <213 to <74 faith.

1:5 And now, <230 two <426 <421 had <421 away, and the people
of Nephi had waxed strong in the <76 They observed to keep the law of
Moses and the sabbath day holy unto the Lord. And they profaned not;
neither did they blaspheme. And the laws of the land were <128
strict.

1:6 And they were scattered upon much of the face of the land, and the
Lamanites also. And they were <27 more numerous than were they
of the Nephites; and they loved murder and would drink the blood of
beasts.

1:7 And it came to pass that they came many times against us, the
Nephites, to battle. But our kings and our leaders were mighty men in
the faith of the Lord; and they taught the <133 the ways of the <10
<329 we withstood the <79 and <221 them away out of our
lands, and began to fortify our cities, or whatsoever <434 of our
inheritance.

1:8 And we multiplied exceedingly, and spread upon the face of the
<122 and became <116 rich in gold, and in silver, and in
precious things, and in fine workmanship of wood, in buildings, and in
machinery, and also in iron and copper, and brass and steel, making all
manner of tools of every kind to till the ground, and weapons of
war—yea, the sharp pointed arrow, and the quiver, and the dart, and the
javelin, and all preparations for war.

1:9 And thus being prepared to meet the <458 they did not prosper
<168 us. But the word of the Lord was verified, <312 he spake unto
our fathers, saying that: Inasmuch as ye will keep my commandments ye
<478 <31 in the <297

1:10 And it came to pass that the prophets of the Lord did threaten the
<193 of Nephi, <348 to the word of God, that if they did not
keep the commandments, but <467 fall into transgression, they <5
be destroyed from off the face of the <54

1:11 Wherefore, the prophets, and the priests, and the teachers, did
labor diligently, exhorting with all long-suffering the <57 to
diligence; teaching the law of Moses, and the intent for <112 it was
given; persuading them to look forward unto the Messiah, and believe in
him to come as though he already was. And after this <201 did they
teach them.

1:12 And it came to pass that by so doing they kept them from <184
<96 upon the face of the land; for they did prick <477 hearts
with the word, continually stirring them up unto repentance.

1:13 And it came to pass that two <490 and thirty and eight <494
had <495 away—after the <70 of wars, and contentions, and
dissensions, for the space of much of the time.

1:14 And I, Jarom, do not write more, for the plates are small. But
behold, my brethren, ye can go to the other <14 of Nephi; for
<14 upon them the records of our wars are engraven, <223 to
the writings of the kings, or those <166 they caused to be written.

1:15 And I deliver these <39 into the hands of my son Omni, that
they may be kept <38 to the <294 of my fathers.




 THE BOOK OF OMNI


1:1 Behold, it came to pass that I, <41 <178 commanded by my father,
<115 that I <284 <116 somewhat upon <63 plates, to preserve our
genealogy—

1:2 <284 in my days, I would that ye <23 know that I fought
much with the sword to <27 my people, the Nephites, from falling
into the <99 of <220 enemies, the Lamanites. But <143 I of myself
am a wicked man, and I have not kept the statutes and the <110
of the Lord as I ought to have done.

1:3 And it came to pass that two <242 and seventy and six <242 had
<242 away, and we had many seasons of peace; and we had many <7
of serious war and bloodshed. Yea, and in fine, two <33 and eighty
and two <34 had <33 <33 and I had kept <134 <197 <184 to
the <75 of my fathers; and I conferred them upon my son
Amaron. And I make an end.

1:4 And now I, Amaron, <169 the things whatsoever I write, <248 are
few, in the book of my father.

1:5 <207 it came to pass that three <73 and twenty <70 had
<71 <71 and the more <150 part of the Nephites were destroyed.

1:6 For the Lord <202 not suffer, <437 he had led them out of the
land of Jerusalem and kept and preserved them from <203 into the
<203 of <203 <203 yea, he <31 not suffer that the words <236
not be verified, <88 he spake unto our fathers, saying that: Inasmuch
as ye will not keep my <136 ye shall not prosper in the land.

1:7 <277 the Lord did visit them in great judgment; nevertheless,
he did spare the righteous that they <51 not perish, but did <375
them out of the <74 of <74 enemies.

1:8 And it came to pass that I did <22 the <200 unto my brother
Chemish.

1:9 Now I, Chemish, <182 what few <183 I <182 in the same book
with my brother; for <316 I saw the last <108 he wrote, that he
wrote it with his own hand; and he <8 it in the day that he
delivered them unto me. And <174 this manner we keep the records, for
it is <270 to the <133 of our <454 And I make an end.

1:10 <236 I, Abinadom, am the son of <89 <8 it came to
pass that I saw much war and contention between my <413 the
<414 and the Lamanites; and I, with my own sword, have taken the
lives of many of the Lamanites in the defence of my brethren.

1:11 And <116 the record of this people is engraven upon <153
<122 is had by the kings, <90 to the generations; and I know of
no revelation save that <19 has been written, neither prophecy;
wherefore, that <9 is sufficient is written. And I make an end.

1:12 <102 I am Amaleki, the son of Abinadom. <8 I will speak
unto you somewhat concerning Mosiah, who was made king over the land of
Zarahemla; for <82 he being warned of the Lord that he <264 flee
out of the land of Nephi, and as many as <334 hearken unto the voice
of the Lord <22 also depart out of the land with him, into the
wilderness—

1:13 And it came to pass that he did <121 as the Lord had
commanded him. And they departed out of the land into the wilderness,
as many as <56 <56 unto the <56 of the Lord; and they were led
by many preachings and prophesyings. And they were admonished
continually by the word of God; and they were led by the power of his
arm, through the <47 until they came down into the land <171
is called the land of Zarahemla.

1:14 And they discovered a <260 who were <16 the <226 of
<17 Now, there was <422 rejoicing among the <11 of
<165 and also Zarahemla did rejoice exceedingly, because the Lord
had sent the <17 of Mosiah with the <255 of brass <57 contained
the <269 of the Jews.

1:15 <218 it came to pass that <24 <62 that the <30 of
<44 came out from Jerusalem at the time that Zedekiah, king of
Judah, was carried away captive into Babylon.

1:16 And they journeyed in the <119 and were brought by the hand
of the Lord across the <96 waters, into the land where <55
<56 them; and they had dwelt <112 from that time forth.

1:17 And at the time that <22 <21 them, they had become
exceedingly numerous. Nevertheless, they had had many wars and serious
contentions, and had fallen by the sword from time to time; and their
language had <29 corrupted; and they had <77 no records with
<63 and they denied the <327 of <21 Creator; and <346 nor the
<131 of <6 could understand them.

1:18 But it came to pass that <74 caused that they <327 be taught
in his language. And it came to pass that after they were <14 in the
<66 of <40 <171 gave a genealogy of his fathers,
<333 to his memory; and they are <445 but not in these plates.

1:19 And it came to pass that the <75 of Zarahemla, and of <38
did unite together; and <70 was appointed to be <98 king.

1:20 And it came to pass in the days of <26 <179 was a large stone
<132 unto him with engravings on it; and he did interpret the
<9 by the gift and <356 of God.

1:21 And they gave an account of one Coriantumr, and the slain of his
people. And Coriantumr was <213 by the <84 of <336 and
he <238 with them for the space of nine moons.

1:22 It also spake a few words concerning his fathers. And his first
parents came out from the tower, at the time the Lord confounded the
<165 of the people; and the severity of the Lord fell upon them
<168 to his judgments, <376 are just; and <136 bones lay
scattered in the land northward.

1:23 <381 I, Amaleki, was born in the days of Mosiah; and I have
lived to see his death; and Benjamin, his son, reigneth in his stead.

1:24 And behold, I have seen, in the days of king <21 a <325
war and much bloodshed between the Nephites and the Lamanites. But
<25 the <8 did obtain much advantage over <319 yea, insomuch
that king Benjamin did drive them out of the land of <506

1:25 And it came to pass that I began to be old; and, having no seed,
and knowing king <33 to be a just man before the Lord, wherefore,
I shall deliver up <297 plates unto him, exhorting all men to come
unto God, the Holy One of Israel, and believe in prophesying, and in
revelations, and in the ministering of angels, and in the gift of
speaking with tongues, and in the gift of interpreting languages, and
in all things <188 are good; for <308 is nothing <7 is good save
it comes from the Lord; and that <12 is evil cometh from the devil.

1:26 And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye <430 come unto
Christ, who is the Holy One of <86 and partake of his salvation,
and the <339 of his redemption. Yea, come unto him, and offer your
whole souls as an offering unto him, and continue in fasting and
praying, and endure to the end; and as the Lord liveth ye will be
saved.

1:27 And now I <71 speak somewhat <337 a certain number who
went up into the wilderness to return to the land of Nephi; for <125
was a <434 <21 who were desirous to possess the land of <327
inheritance.

1:28 Wherefore, they went up into the wilderness. And <15 leader
being a strong and mighty man, and a stiffnecked man, wherefore he
caused a contention among <284 and they were all slain, save fifty, in
the wilderness, and they returned again to the land of <289

1:29 And it came to pass that they also took others to a considerable
number, and took <62 journey <29 into the <69

1:30 And I, <401 had a brother, who also went with <62 and I have
not since known <138 them. And I am about to lie down in my
grave; and <314 <314 are full. And I make an end of my speaking.




 THE WORDS OF MORMON


1:1 And now I, Mormon, <137 <46 to <355 up the record <286 I
have been making into the hands of my son Moroni, behold I have
witnessed almost all the destruction of my people, the Nephites.

1:2 And it is many hundred years after the coming of Christ that I
<49 <89 records into the <42 of my son; and it supposeth me
that he will witness the entire <44 of my people. But may God
grant that he may survive them, that he may write <279 <141
<8 and <5 <5 <352 that perhaps some day it may
profit <155

1:3 And now, I <304 <20 <20 that <111 I have written; for
<80 I had made an abridgment from the <167 of Nephi, down to the
reign of this king Benjamin, of whom Amaleki spake, I searched <271
the <99 <36 had been delivered into my hands, and I found <111
plates, <13 contained this small account of the prophets, from Jacob
down to the <42 of this king <42 and also many of the words of
Nephi.

1:4 And the <500 <35 are upon <41 <74 pleasing me, because of
the prophecies of the <170 of Christ; and my fathers knowing that
many of them have been fulfilled; yea, and I also know that as many
<39 as have been prophesied <129 us down to this day have been
fulfilled, and as many as go beyond this day must surely come to pass—

1:5 <420 I chose <70 things, to finish my <274 upon <189
<82 remainder of my <8 I shall take from the <88 of <467 and
I cannot <212 the hundredth part of the <67 of my <235

1:6 But behold, I <28 take <45 <155 <38 contain <4
prophesyings and revelations, and put them with the <49 of my
record, for they are choice unto me; and I know they will be <9
unto my brethren.

1:7 And I do this for a wise purpose; for thus it whispereth me,
according to the workings of the Spirit of the Lord <62 is in me. And
now, I do not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all <95 <19
are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do <41 to his will.

1:8 And my prayer to God is <184 my brethren, that they may once
again come to the knowledge of God, yea, the redemption of <230 that
they may once <17 be a delightsome <148

1:9 And now I, <467 proceed to <191 out my <134 <70 I take
from the <185 of <185 and I make it <71 to the <48 and
the understanding <21 God has given me.

1:10 <231 it came to pass that <385 <364 had <355 up
<191 <37 into the <462 of king <337 he took them and put them
with the other <212 <40 <367 <383 <3 had been handed
down by the kings, from generation to <2 until the days of king
Benjamin.

1:11 And they were <24 down from king <46 from <21 to
<3 <24 they have fallen into my hands. And I, <117 pray to
God that they may be preserved from this time henceforth. And I know
that they will be preserved; for there are great <208 written upon
<332 out of <80 my people and their brethren <305 be judged at the
<20 and last day, <147 to the word of God <22 is written.

1:12 And now, <219 this king Benjamin—he had somewhat of
contentions <507 his own <202

1:13 And it came to pass also that the armies of the Lamanites came
down out of the land of Nephi, to battle against his <30 But
<377 king Benjamin gathered together his armies, and he did stand
<17 them; and he did fight with the strength of his own arm, with
the sword of Laban.

1:14 And in the <18 of the Lord they did contend <33 <118
enemies, <168 they had slain many thousands of the Lamanites. And it
came to pass that they did <23 <23 the <87 <22 they had
driven them out of all the lands of <37 inheritance.

1:15 And it came to pass that <279 <182 had been false Christs, and
<20 mouths had been shut, and they punished <171 to <10
crimes;

1:16 And <26 <26 had been <26 prophets, and <3 preachers and
teachers <169 the people, and all <316 having been <31 <31
to <32 <31 and <27 <27 <11 been much contention and many
dissensions away unto the Lamanites, <162 it came to pass that king
<295 with the assistance of the holy prophets who were <47 his
people—

1:17 For <27 king <189 was a holy man, and he did reign over
his <277 in righteousness; and <58 were many holy men in the land,
and they did speak the word of God with power and with authority; and
they did use much sharpness because of the stiffneckedness of the

all the might of his body and the faculty of his whole soul, and also

 THE BOOK OF MOSIAH

Mosiah Chapter 1

1:1 And now <105 was no more <163 in all the land of Zarahemla,
<144 all the <124 who belonged to king <77 so that king
<146 had continual <58 all the remainder of his days.

1:2 And it came to pass that he had three sons; and he called <219
names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman. And he caused that they should
be taught in all the language of his fathers, that thereby they <129
become men of understanding; and that they <9 know <447 the
prophecies <460 had been spoken by the <308 of <50 <28 <10
were delivered them by the hand of the Lord.

1:3 And he also <54 them <34 the records <23 were engraven
on the plates of brass, saying: My sons, I would that ye <78
remember that were it not for <325 plates, <26 contain <4 <30
and <4 commandments, we must have suffered in ignorance, even at
this present time, not knowing the mysteries of God.

1:4 For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have
remembered all <38 things, to have <79 them to his children,
except it were for the help of <17 plates; for he <380 been <19
in the <152 of the Egyptians therefore he <38 read <18
engravings, and teach them to his <35 that <165 they <14
<10 them to <147 <10 and so fulfilling the commandments of
God, even down to this <92 time.

1:5 I say unto you, my <136 were it not for <47 <82 <128 have
been kept and preserved by the hand of God, that we <207 read and
understand of his mysteries, and have his <51 always before
our eyes, that even our fathers <176 have dwindled in unbelief, and we
<181 have been like unto our brethren, the <483 who know
nothing <213 <59 <59 or even do not believe them when they
are <130 them, <428 of the traditions of <108 <255 <78 are
not correct.

1:6 O my <96 I <56 that ye <51 <231 that <40 sayings are
true, and also that <8 <231 are true. And behold, also the <261
of Nephi, <39 <245 the <14 and the <25 of our <92 from
the time they left Jerusalem until now, and they are true; and we can
know of <70 surety <77 we have them <125 our eyes.

1:7 And now, my <73 I <73 that ye <73 <73 to search them
diligently, that ye may profit thereby; and I <17 that ye <17 keep
the <163 of God, that ye may prosper in the land according to
the promises <86 the Lord made unto our fathers.

1:8 And many more things did king <476 <256 his <61 <21 are
not written in this book.

1:9 And it came to pass that after king <24 had made an end of
teaching his <30 that he waxed old, and he saw that he must very soon
go the way of all the earth; therefore, he thought it expedient that he
<98 confer the kingdom upon one of his sons.

1:10 Therefore, he had Mosiah brought <148 him; and <198 are the
words <84 he spake unto him, <458 My son, I <136 that ye <38
make a proclamation throughout all this land among all this people, or
the people of Zarahemla, and the <5 of <45 who dwell in the
land, that <390 they may be gathered together; for on the morrow I
shall proclaim unto this my <27 out of mine own mouth that thou art
a king and a ruler over this <53 whom the Lord our God hath given
us.

1:11 And moreover, I <39 give this <37 a name, that <58 they
may be distinguished above all the <13 <111 the Lord God hath
<126 out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I do <288 they have
been a diligent <25 in keeping the <259 of the Lord.

1:12 And I give unto them a name that never <62 be blotted out,
except it be through transgression.

1:13 Yea, and moreover I say unto you, that if this highly favored
<48 of the Lord <175 fall into transgression, and become a wicked
and an adulterous <122 that the Lord will deliver them up, that
<108 they <19 weak like unto <377 brethren; and he will no more
preserve them by his matchless and marvelous power, as he has hitherto
preserved our <337

1:14 For I say unto you, that if he had not extended his arm in the
preservation of our <444 they must have fallen into the hands of the
Lamanites, and <64 victims to <63 hatred.

1:15 And it came to pass that <356 king <356 had made an end of
<304 <485 to his son, that he gave him charge concerning all the
affairs of the kingdom.

1:16 And <230 he also gave him <19 <19 the records <220
were engraven on the plates of brass; and also the <6 of Nephi; and
also, the sword of Laban, and the ball or director, <27 led our
<100 <199 the wilderness, <8 was prepared by the hand of the
Lord that <168 they might be led, every one <494 to the heed
and diligence <25 they gave unto him.

1:17 <413 as they were unfaithful they did not prosper nor
progress in <135 journey, but were driven back, and incurred the
displeasure of God upon them; and therefore they were smitten with
famine and sore afflictions, to stir them up in remembrance of <33
duty.

1:18 And now, it came to pass that <425 went and did as his father
had commanded him, and proclaimed unto all the <293 who were in the
land of Zarahemla that <109 they <109 gather themselves together,
to go up to the temple to hear the <503 <112 his <39 <319 speak
unto them.

<54 Chapter 2

2:1 And it came to pass that <237 <14 had done as his <28 had
<67 him, and had made a proclamation throughout all the <505
that the <74 <504 <62 together <11 all the <11
that they <73 go up to the <68 to hear the <68 <68 king
<282 <69 <69 unto <68

2:2 And there were a great number, even so many that they did not
number <171 for they had multiplied exceedingly and waxed <19 in the
land.

2:3 And they also took of the firstlings of <177 flocks, that they
<67 offer sacrifice and burnt offerings <250 to the law of
Moses;

2:4 And also that they <21 give thanks to the Lord <32 God, who had
brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, and who had delivered them
out of the <408 of <24 enemies, and had appointed just men to be
<10 teachers, and also a just man to be <9 king, who had
established peace in the land of Zarahemla, and who had taught them to
keep the commandments of God, that they <75 rejoice and be filled
with love towards God and all men.

2:5 And it came to pass that when they came up to the temple, they
pitched <59 tents round about, <379 man <129 to his family,
consisting of his wife, and his sons, and his daughters, and <22
<7 and <4 <7 from the eldest down to the youngest, <31
family being separate one from another.

2:6 And they <50 <24 <50 <50 about the <59 <21 man
having his tent with the door thereof <91 the <13 that <341
they <106 remain in <26 <26 and hear the <268 <268 king <267
<268 <268 unto <248

2:7 For the multitude <59 so <250 that king <18 could not teach
them all within the walls of the <46 <443 he caused a tower to
be erected, that <55 his <334 <55 hear the <50 <50 he
<49 <49 unto <317

2:8 And it came to pass that he began to <16 to his <28 from the
tower; and they <59 not all hear his <36 because of the greatness
of the multitude; <61 he <61 that the <14 <50 he spake
<51 be written and sent forth among those that were not under the
sound of his voice, that they <78 also receive his words.

2:9 And these are the <38 <38 he <38 and <46 to be written,
saying: My brethren, all ye that have assembled yourselves <504
you that can hear my <26 <26 I shall <97 unto you this day; for I
have not <480 you to come up hither to trifle with the <24 <24
I <25 speak, but that you <92 hearken unto me, and open your ears
that ye may hear, and your hearts that ye may understand, and your
minds that the mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view.

2:10 I have not <61 you to come up <61 that ye <50 fear me,
or that ye <7 think that I of myself am more than a mortal man.

2:11 But I am like as yourselves, subject to all manner of infirmities
in body and mind; yet I have been chosen by this people, and
consecrated by my father, and was suffered by the hand of the Lord that
I <59 be a ruler and a king over this people; and have been kept and
preserved by his matchless power, to serve you with all the might, mind
and strength <156 the Lord hath granted unto me.

2:12 I say unto you that as I have been <62 to spend my days in
your service, even up to this time, and have not sought gold nor silver
nor any <110 of riches of you;

2:13 Neither have I <36 that ye <91 be confined in dungeons,
nor that ye <9 make slaves one of another, nor that ye <9
murder, or plunder, or steal, or commit adultery; nor even have I
<36 that ye <18 <11 any <54 of wickedness, and have
taught you that ye <13 keep the commandments of the Lord, in all
things <119 he hath <228 you—

2:14 And even I, myself, have labored with mine own hands that I <360
<152 you, and that ye <39 not be laden with taxes, and that there
<10 nothing come upon you <43 was grievous to be borne—and of all
<381 <54 <11 I have spoken, ye <367 are witnesses this day.

2:15 Yet, my <384 I have not done <23 <23 that I <58 boast,
neither do I tell <11 <11 that <509 I <12 accuse you; but I
tell you <13 <13 that ye may know that I can answer a clear
conscience before God this day.

2:16 Behold, I say unto you that <504 I said unto you that I had
spent my days in your <232 I do not desire to <67 for I have
only been in the service of God.

2:17 And behold, I tell you <69 <69 that ye may learn wisdom; that
ye may <6 that when ye are in the <30 of your fellow beings ye
are only in the <11 of your God.

2:18 <84 ye have called me your king; and if I, whom ye call your
king, do labor to <201 you, then ought not ye to <9 to <9 one
another?

2:19 And behold also, if I, whom ye call your <30 who has <117 his
days in your <118 and yet has been in the <69 of God, do merit
any thanks from you, O how you <52 to thank your heavenly King!

2:20 I say unto you, my <224 that if you <260 render all the
<30 and praise <252 your whole soul has power to possess, to that
God who has created you, and has kept and <461 you, and has caused
that ye <36 rejoice, and has <453 that ye <7 live in peace
one with another—

2:21 I say unto you that if ye <19 <128 him who has <45 you
from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by lending
you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own
will, and even supporting you from one moment to another—I say, if ye
<51 <51 him with all your <109 souls yet ye would be unprofitable
servants.

2:22 And <267 all that he requires of you is to keep his
commandments; and he has promised you that if ye <31 keep his
<464 ye <47 prosper in the land; and he never doth vary from
that <165 he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his <25 he
doth bless you and <29 you.

2:23 And now, in the first place, he hath <137 you, and <167 unto
you your lives, for <41 ye are indebted unto him.

2:24 And secondly, he doth require that ye <71 do as he hath
commanded you; for <26 if ye do, he doth immediately <60 you; and
therefore he hath paid you. And ye are still <43 unto him, and
are, and will be, forever and ever; <95 of what have ye to
boast?

2:25 And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves? I <485 you, Nay.
Ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the earth; yet ye
were <114 of the dust of the <11 but <193 it belongeth to him
who <15 you.

2:26 And I, even I, whom ye call your <395 am no better than ye
yourselves are; for I am also of the dust. And ye <421 that I am old,
and am about to yield up this mortal frame to its mother earth.

2:27 Therefore, as I said unto you that I had served you, walking with
a clear conscience before God, even so I at this time have <382 that
ye <187 assemble <66 together, that I might be found
blameless, and that your blood <15 not come upon me, when I shall
stand to be judged of God of the things whereof he hath <217 me
concerning you.

2:28 I say unto you that I have <56 that ye <40 <55
<56 together that I <56 rid my garments of your blood, at this
period of time when I am <123 to go down to my grave, that I <25 go
down in peace, and my immortal spirit may join the choirs above in
singing the praises of a just God.

2:29 And moreover, I say unto you that I have <72 that ye <72
<73 <72 <128 that I <47 declare unto you that I can
no longer be your teacher, nor your king;

2:30 For even at this time, my <459 <200 doth tremble exceedingly
while attempting to speak unto you; but the Lord God doth support me,
and hath suffered me that I <59 <18 unto you, and hath <156
me that I <11 <63 unto you this day, that my son Mosiah is a
king and a ruler over you.

2:31 And now, my brethren, I <489 that ye <31 do as ye have
hitherto done. As ye have kept my commandments, and also the
<481 of my father, and have prospered, and have been kept from
falling into the hands of your enemies, even so if ye <248 keep the
<28 of my son, or the <6 of God <461 <14 be
delivered unto you by him, ye <9 prosper in the land, and your
enemies <9 have no power over you.

2:32 But, O my people, beware lest there <17 arise contentions among
you, and ye list to obey the evil spirit, <50 was spoken of by my
father Mosiah.

2:33 For <439 <30 is a wo pronounced upon him who listeth to obey
that spirit; for if he <9 to obey him, and remaineth and dieth in
his sins, the same drinketh damnation to his own soul; for he receiveth
for his wages an everlasting punishment, having transgressed the law of
God contrary to his own knowledge.

2:34 I say unto you, that <68 are not any <98 you, except it be
your little children that have not been taught <395 these things,
but what knoweth that ye are eternally indebted to your heavenly
Father, to render to him all that you have and are; and also have been
<33 <33 the records <137 contain the prophecies <4 have
been <143 by the holy prophets, even down to the time our <240
Lehi, left Jerusalem;

2:35 And also, all that has been <26 by our fathers until now. And
<165 <14 they spake that <43 was <327 them of the Lord;
therefore, they are just and true.

2:36 And now, I say unto you, my <319 that after ye have known and
have been <86 all <119 <119 if ye <330 transgress and go
<161 to that <49 has been spoken, that ye do withdraw <444
from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may have no place in you to guide
you in wisdom’s paths that ye may be blessed, <350 and preserved—

2:37 I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same cometh out
in open rebellion against God; therefore he <266 to obey the evil
<305 and becometh an enemy to all righteousness; <120 the Lord
has no <64 in him, for he dwelleth not in unholy temples.

2:38 Therefore if that man repenteth not, and <302 and <302 an
<36 to God, the demands of divine justice do awaken his immortal soul
to a lively sense of his own guilt, <133 doth cause him to shrink from
the presence of the <130 and doth fill his breast with <20 and
pain, and anguish, <25 is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame
ascendeth up forever and ever.

2:39 And now I say unto you, that mercy hath no claim on that man;
<128 his final doom is to endure a never-ending torment.

2:40 O, all ye old men, and also ye young men, and you <356 <356
who can understand my words, for I have <290 plainly unto you that ye
might understand, I pray that ye <249 awake to a remembrance of the
awful situation of those that have fallen into transgression.

2:41 And moreover, I would desire that ye <28 consider on the
blessed and happy state of <27 that keep the commandments of God. For
<342 they are <17 in all <305 both temporal and spiritual;
and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven,
that thereby they may dwell with God in a <47 of <127
happiness. O remember, remember that <345 things are true; for the
Lord God hath <115 it.

Mosiah Chapter 3

3:1 And again my <382 I <95 call your attention, for I have
somewhat more to speak unto you; for <87 I have <44 to tell you
<482 that <227 is to come.

3:2 And the <17 <11 I shall tell you are made <422 unto me by an
angel from God. And he said unto me: Awake; and I awoke, and behold he
stood before me.

3:3 And he said unto me: Awake, and hear the words <46 I <46 tell
thee; for <74 I am come to declare unto you the glad tidings of
great joy.

3:4 For the Lord hath heard thy prayers, and hath judged of thy
righteousness, and hath sent me to <33 unto thee that thou mayest
rejoice; and that thou <6 <12 unto thy people, that they may
also be filled with joy.

3:5 For <68 the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with
power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all
eternity to all eternity, <102 come down from heaven among the
<336 of men, and <12 <240 in a tabernacle of clay, and <8 go
forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick,
raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their
sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases.

3:6 And he <47 cast out devils, or the evil spirits <179 <63 in
the hearts of the <75 of men.

3:7 And lo, he <26 suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger,
thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto
death; for <147 blood cometh from every pore, so <209 <33 be his
anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people.

3:8 And he <20 be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of
<155 and earth, the Creator of all <317 from the beginning; and his
mother <28 be <28 Mary.

3:9 And lo, he <65 unto his own, that salvation <502 come unto the
<113 of men even through faith on his name; and even after all this
they <38 <489 him a man, and say that he hath a devil, and <13
scourge him, and <5 crucify him.

3:10 And he <9 rise the third day from the dead; and <130 he
standeth to judge the world; and <9 all <472 <94 are done that
a righteous judgment <77 come upon the <76 of men.

3:11 For <23 and also his <165 atoneth for the sins of those who
have fallen by the transgression of Adam, who have died not knowing the
will of God <473 them, or who have ignorantly sinned.

3:12 But wo, wo unto him who knoweth that he rebelleth against God! For
<145 <151 to none such <229 it be <143 repentance and <145
on the Lord <202 Christ.

3:13 And the Lord God hath sent his holy prophets <361 all the
<98 of men, to <421 <116 <116 to <256 kindred, nation, and
tongue, that thereby whosoever should believe that Christ <4 come,
the same <128 <351 remission of <353 sins, and rejoice with
exceedingly <282 joy, even as though he had already come <50 them.

3:14 Yet the Lord God saw that his people were a stiffnecked <477
and he appointed unto them a law, even the law of Moses.

3:15 And many signs, and wonders, and types, and shadows showed he unto
<153 <155 his coming; and also holy <106 spake unto them
<11 his <11 and yet they hardened <83 hearts, and
understood not that the law of Moses availeth nothing <156 it were
<157 the atonement of his blood.

3:16 And even if it were possible that little <148 could sin they
<4 not be saved; but I say unto you they are blessed; for <256 as
in <241 or by nature, they fall, even so the <265 of <161 <267
for <72 sins.

3:17 And moreover, I say unto you, that there <330 be no other name
given nor any <6 way nor means whereby <248 can come unto the
<71 of men, only in and <95 the name of <449 the Lord
Omnipotent.

3:18 For behold he judgeth, and his <347 is just; and the infant
perisheth not that dieth in his infancy; but men drink damnation to
<79 own souls <141 they humble themselves and become as <127
children, and <260 that <67 was, and is, and is to <265 in
and <66 the atoning <115 of <67 the Lord <66

3:19 For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall
of <151 and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the
enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the <37 man and
becometh a saint <59 the <220 of <173 the Lord, and <11
as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to
submit to all <370 which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even
as a child doth <19 to his father.

3:20 And <209 I say unto you, that the time <210 come when the
knowledge of the Savior <9 spread throughout <413 <412 <414
<412 and people.

3:21 And <267 when that time cometh, none <21 be found blameless
before God, <179 it be <175 <174 only <102 <479 and
<480 on the name of the Lord God <165

3:22 And even at this time, when thou shalt have taught thy <421 the
<107 <107 the Lord thy God hath commanded thee, even then are they
<56 no more <58 in the sight of God, only according to the
words <28 I have spoken unto thee.

3:23 And now I have <11 the <17 <17 the Lord God hath <44
me.

3:24 And thus saith the Lord: They <108 stand as a bright testimony
against this <493 at the <315 day; whereof they <16 be judged,
<146 man <62 to his works, whether they be good, or <5 they
be evil.

3:25 And if they be evil they are consigned to an awful view of <336
own guilt and abominations, <77 doth cause them to shrink from the
presence of the Lord into a state of misery and endless torment, from
whence they can no more return; therefore they have drunk <378 to
<42 own souls.

3:26 Therefore, they have <14 out of the cup of the wrath of God,
<57 justice <512 no more deny unto them than it <8 deny that Adam
should fall because of his partaking of the forbidden fruit; therefore,
mercy <18 have claim on them no more forever.

3:27 And <62 torment is as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames
are unquenchable, and <6 smoke ascendeth up <399 and ever. Thus
hath the Lord <198 me. Amen.

Mosiah Chapter 4

4:1 And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of
speaking the <235 <101 had been delivered unto him by the angel of
the <420 that he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and
behold they had fallen to the earth, for the fear of the Lord had come
upon them.

4:2 And they had viewed themselves in <113 own carnal state, even less
than the dust of the earth. And they all cried aloud with one voice,
saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of <495 that we may
receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we
believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and <85
and all things; who <323 come down among the children of men.

4:3 And it came to pass that after they had <381 these <146 the
Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy,
having received a remission of <114 <74 and <8 peace of
conscience, <259 of the exceeding <487 <180 they had in <78
<101 who <274 come, <385 to the <48 <14 king <206 had
<56 unto <159

4:4 And king <12 again opened his mouth and began to speak unto
<65 <145 My friends and my brethren, my kindred and my <438 I
would <25 call your attention, that ye may hear and understand the
remainder of my <56 <56 I <130 <37 unto you.

4:5 For behold, if the knowledge of the goodness of God at this time
has awakened you to a sense of your nothingness, and your worthless and
<260 state—

4:6 I say unto you, if ye have come to a <40 of the <40 of
God, and his matchless power, and his wisdom, and his patience, and his
long-suffering towards the <200 of men; and also, the atonement
<85 has been prepared from the foundation of the world, that thereby
salvation might come to him that <166 put his trust in the <348 and
<9 be diligent in keeping his commandments, and continue in the
<196 even unto the end of his life, I mean the life of the mortal
body—

4:7 I say, that this is the man who receiveth salvation, through the
<76 <75 was <74 from the <74 of the world for all
mankind, <13 ever were since the fall of Adam, or who are, or who
ever <186 be, even unto the end of the world.

4:8 And this is the means whereby <109 cometh. And there is none
other <8 save this <45 hath been <272 of; neither are <15
any conditions <23 man can be saved except the <8 <19 I
have told you.

4:9 Believe in God; <396 that he is, and that he <394 all things,
both in <399 and in earth; <17 that he has all <205 and all
<212 both in <16 and in <16 <16 that man doth not
comprehend all the things <56 the Lord can comprehend.

4:10 And again, <21 that ye must repent of your sins and forsake
<346 and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart
that he <347 forgive you; and now, if you <33 all <445 <48 see
that ye do <395

4:11 And <368 I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye have
come to the <316 of the glory of God, or if ye have known of his
<327 and have tasted of his love, and have <480 a <480 of
your <481 <107 causeth such exceedingly great joy in your souls, even
so I <83 that ye <303 remember, and always retain in remembrance,
the greatness of God, and your own <399 and his <50 and
<363 <363 you, unworthy creatures, and <126 <126
even in the depths of humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily,
and standing steadfastly in the <341 of that <69 is to come, <4
was <255 by the mouth of the angel.

4:12 And <477 I say unto you that if ye do this ye <311 <81
rejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and <12 <93 a
<121 of your sins; and ye <23 grow in the <156 of the <156
of him that <277 you, or in the <13 of that <69 is just and
true.

4:13 And ye will not have a mind to injure one another, but to live
peaceably, and to render to every man according to that <35 is his
due.

4:14 And ye will not suffer your children that they go hungry, or
naked; <377 will ye <13 that they transgress the laws of God, and
fight and quarrel one with <56 and serve the devil, who is the
master of sin, or who is the evil spirit <59 hath been <163 of by
our fathers, he being an enemy to all righteousness.

4:15 But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness;
ye will <14 them to love one <60 and to <61 one another.

4:16 And also, ye <247 will succor those that stand in need of
your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that
standeth in need; and ye will not <117 that the beggar putteth up his
petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.

4:17 Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his
misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my
food, nor impart unto him of my <70 that he may not suffer, for
his punishments are just—

4:18 But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath
<404 cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that <182 he hath
done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.

4:19 For <352 are we not all beggars? Do we not all depend upon the
same Being, even God, for all the <83 <44 we have, for both
food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches
<21 we have of <315 kind?

4:20 And <54 even at this time, ye have been <450 on his name,
and begging for a <395 of your sins. And has he suffered that ye
have begged in vain? Nay; he has poured out his Spirit upon you, and
has caused that your hearts should be <439 with joy, and has <11
that your mouths <12 be stopped that ye could not find utterance, so
exceedingly <158 was your joy.

4:21 And now, if God, who has <446 you, on whom you are dependent
for your lives and for all that ye have and are, doth grant unto you
whatsoever ye ask that is right, in faith, believing that ye <493
receive, O then, how ye ought to <251 of the <166 that ye have
one to <351

4:22 And if ye judge the man who <322 up his <321 to you for
your <28 that he perish not, and condemn him, how much more just
will be your condemnation for withholding your substance, <193 doth
not belong to you but to God, to whom also your life belongeth; and yet
ye put up no petition, nor repent of the thing <29 thou hast done.

4:23 I say unto you, wo be unto that man, for his <69 <110
<69 with him; and now, I say these things unto <443 who are rich as
pertaining to the <11 of this world.

4:24 And again, I say unto the poor, ye who have not and yet have
sufficient, that ye remain from day to day; I mean all you who deny the
beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your <256 that: I
give not <17 I have not, but if I had I <21 give.

4:25 And now, if ye say this in your <29 ye <56 guiltless,
otherwise ye are condemned; and your <166 is just for ye covet
that <140 ye have not received.

4:26 And now, for the sake of <126 <115 <17 I have spoken unto
you—that is, for the sake of retaining a <365 of your sins from
day to day, that ye may walk guiltless before God—I <80 that ye
<342 <273 of your <176 to the <143 <417 man according to
that <48 he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked,
visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually
and temporally, <29 to <9 wants.

4:27 And see that all <87 <87 are done in wisdom and order; for it
is not requisite that a man <68 run faster than he has strength. And
<218 it is expedient that he <15 be diligent, that thereby he
might win the prize; therefore, all <44 must be done in order.

4:28 And I <112 that ye <28 remember, that whosoever among you
borroweth of his neighbor <11 return the <317 that he borroweth,
<91 as he doth agree, or else thou shalt commit sin; and perhaps
thou <7 cause thy <27 to <11 sin also.

4:29 And finally, I cannot tell you all the <69 whereby ye may
<20 sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I
<25 number them.

4:30 But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves,
and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the
commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard
concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye
must perish. And now, O man, <143 and <426 not.

Mosiah Chapter 5

5:1 And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had thus <312 to
his people, he sent <173 them, desiring to know of his people if they
believed the words <288 he had <24 unto <120

5:2 And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the
<25 <25 thou hast <25 unto us; and also, we know of <297 surety
and truth, <436 of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, <24 has
wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more
disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.

5:3 And we, ourselves, <52 through the infinite goodness of God, and
the manifestations of his Spirit, have great views of that <54 is to
come; and were it expedient, we could prophesy of all things.

5:4 And it is the <201 <24 we have had on the <270 <7 our king
has <111 unto us that has brought us to this <49 knowledge, <286
we do rejoice with such exceedingly <10 joy.

5:5 And we are willing to enter into a covenant with our God to do his
will, and to be obedient to his <269 in all <57 that he
shall command us, all the remainder of our days, that we may not bring
upon ourselves a never-ending torment, as has been <78 by the angel,
that we may not drink out of the cup of the wrath of God.

5:6 And now, <493 are the <221 <112 king <272 desired of them;
and therefore he said unto them: Ye have <44 the <18 that I
desired; and the <98 <25 ye have made is a righteous covenant.

5:7 And now, <244 of the <18 <18 ye have made ye <100 be
called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold,
this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts
are changed <241 <201 on his name; therefore, ye are born of him
and have become his sons and his daughters.

5:8 And under this head ye are made free, and <488 is no other head
<215 ye can be made free. There is no <12 name given <12
salvation cometh; <50 I would that ye should take upon you the
name of <93 all you that have entered into the <114 with God
that ye <22 be <226 unto the end of your lives.

5:9 And it <129 come to pass that whosoever doeth this <8 be found
at the right hand of God, for he <12 know the name by <159 he is
called; for he <12 be <160 by the name of Christ.

5:10 And now it <15 come to pass, that <47 <6 not take upon
him the name of Christ must be <31 by some <117 <162 <112 he
findeth himself on the left hand of God.

5:11 And I <127 that ye <105 remember <431 that this is the name
that I said I <13 give unto you that never <6 be blotted out,
except it be <214 transgression; <49 take heed that ye do not
transgress, that the name be not <22 out of your hearts.

5:12 I say unto you, I <60 that ye <41 <60 to retain the name
written always in your hearts, that ye are not <156 on the left hand
of God, but that ye hear and know the voice by <158 ye <132 be
called, and <98 the name by <11 he <11 call you.

5:13 For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who
is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his
heart?

5:14 And again, doth a man take an ass <53 belongeth to his neighbor,
and keep him? I say unto you, Nay; he will not even suffer that he
<73 feed among his flocks, but will drive him away, and cast him out.
I say unto you, that even so <22 it be <23 you if ye know not the
name by <57 ye are called.

5:15 Therefore, I <167 that ye <167 be steadfast and immovable,
<165 abounding in good works, that <358 the Lord God Omnipotent,
may seal you his, that you may be brought to heaven, that ye may have
everlasting <396 and eternal life, <239 the wisdom, and power,
and justice, and mercy of him who created all things, in heaven and in
earth, who is God above all. Amen.

Mosiah Chapter 6

6:1 And now, king Benjamin thought it was expedient, after having
finished speaking to the people, that he <95 take the names of all
those who had <446 into a <446 with God to keep his
commandments.

6:2 And it came to pass that <507 was not one soul, <334 it were
little children, but who had <35 into the <35 and had taken
upon them the name of <431

6:3 And <236 it came to pass that when king <87 had made an end
of all these <122 and had consecrated his son <112 to be a ruler
and a king over his <101 and had given him all the charges
concerning the kingdom, and also had appointed priests to teach the
<21 that thereby they might hear and know the commandments of God,
and to stir them up in remembrance of the oath <250 they had made, he
dismissed the multitude, and they returned, every one, according to
their families, to <3 own houses.

6:4 And <83 began to reign in his father’s stead. And he <9 to
<10 in the thirtieth year of his age, making in the whole, about four
hundred and seventy-six years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.

6:5 And king <143 lived three <17 and he died.

6:6 And it came to pass that king <63 did walk in the ways of the
Lord, and did observe his judgments and his statutes, and did keep his
<128 in all things whatsoever he commanded him.

6:7 And king <37 did cause his people that they <277 till the
earth. And he <506 himself, did till the <324 that <170 he <170
not become burdensome to his <181 that he <10 do <149 to that
<167 his father had done in all things. And <287 was no contention
<441 all his <52 for the space of <114 years.

<66 <361 7

7:1 And now, it came to pass that <360 king <16 had had continual
peace for the <31 of <31 years, he was desirous to know <262
the <46 who went up to dwell in the land of Lehi-Nephi, or in the
city of Lehi-Nephi; for his <20 had heard nothing from them from the
time they left the land of Zarahemla; therefore, they wearied him with
<252 teasings.

7:2 And it came to pass that king <75 granted that sixteen of <18
strong men <133 go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi to inquire <77
<16 brethren.

7:3 And it came to pass that on the morrow they started to go up,
<478 with them one Ammon, he being a <43 and mighty man, and a
descendant of <79 and he was also <43 leader.

7:4 And now, they knew not the course they <228 travel in the
wilderness to go up to the land of <129 therefore they wandered
many days in the wilderness, even forty days did they wander.

7:5 And when they had <21 <14 days they came to a hill, <241 is
north of the land of Shilom, and <242 they pitched <72 tents.

7:6 And Ammon took <210 of his brethren, and <14 names were Amaleki,
Helem, and Hem, and they went down into the land of Nephi.

7:7 And behold, they met the king of the <214 who were in the land of
Nephi, and in the land of Shilom; and they were surrounded by the
king’s guard, and were taken, and were bound, and were committed to
prison.

7:8 And it came to pass when they had been in prison two days they were
again brought before the king, and <91 bands were loosed; and they
stood <12 the <12 and were permitted, or rather commanded, that
they <183 answer the questions <142 he <6 ask them.

7:9 And he said unto them: Behold, I am Limhi, the son of Noah, who was
the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the land of Zarahemla to inherit
this land, <43 was the land of <72 fathers, who was made a king by
the voice of the people.

7:10 And now, I desire to know the <493 whereby ye were so bold as to
come near the walls of the city, when I, myself, was with my guards
without the gate?

7:11 And now, for this <35 have I suffered that ye <112 be
preserved, that I <376 <368 of you, or else I <13 have caused
that my <38 <7 have put you to death. Ye are permitted to speak.

7:12 And now, when <274 saw that he was <15 to speak, he went
forth and bowed himself <183 the king; and rising <202 he said: O
<191 I am very thankful <15 God this day that I am yet alive, and
am <37 to speak; and I will endeavor to speak with boldness;

7:13 For I am assured that if ye had known me ye would not have
<113 that I <93 have worn these bands. For I am <454 and am a
<448 of Zarahemla, and have come up out of the land of <215
to <134 <502 our <375 whom Zeniff <290 up out of that
land.

7:14 And now, it came to pass that after Limhi had heard the words of
<52 he was exceedingly glad, and <119 Now, I know of a surety that
my brethren who were in the land of <58 are yet alive. And now, I
will rejoice; and on the morrow I will <218 that my <415 shall
rejoice also.

7:15 For <432 we are in bondage to the Lamanites, and are taxed with
a tax <311 is grievous to be borne. And now, <23 our <61 will
deliver us out of our bondage, or out of the hands of the <34
and we will be <338 slaves; for it is better that we be slaves to the
Nephites than to pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites.

7:16 And now, king <137 commanded his <287 that they <196 no more
bind <276 nor his <173 but <304 that they <13 go to the hill
<88 was north of Shilom, and bring <63 <86 into the <365 that
thereby they <338 eat, and drink, and rest themselves from the labors
of <21 journey; for they had <251 many things; they had <5
hunger, thirst, and fatigue.

7:17 And now, it came to pass on the <175 that king <84 sent a
proclamation among all his people, that <55 they <55 gather
<52 together to the temple to hear the <240 <83 he <91
<327 unto them.

7:18 And it came to pass that when they had gathered <30
<31 that he spake unto them in this wise, saying: O ye, my <52
lift up your heads and be comforted; for <209 the time is at hand,
or is not far distant, when we <255 no longer be in subjection to our
enemies, notwithstanding our many strugglings, <74 have been in vain;
yet I trust there remaineth an effectual struggle to be made.

7:19 Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your <23 in
God, in that God who was the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; and
also, that God who <392 the children of Israel out of the land of
Egypt, and <233 that they <142 walk through the Red Sea on dry
ground, and fed them with manna that they <173 not perish in the
wilderness; and many more things did he do for <170

7:20 And again, that same God has <59 our fathers out of the land
of Jerusalem, and has kept and preserved his <399 even until now; and
<163 it is because of our iniquities and abominations that he has
<35 us into bondage.

7:21 And ye all are witnesses this day, that Zeniff, who was made king
over this <210 he being over-zealous to inherit the land of his
fathers, therefore <11 deceived by the cunning and craftiness of king
Laman, who having entered into a treaty with king <40 and <9
yielded up into his <434 the possessions of a part of the land, or
even the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom; and the land round
about—

7:22 And all this he did, for the sole purpose of bringing this <126
into <267 or into <110 And <128 we at this time do pay
<467 to the king of the <496 to the amount of one half of our
corn, and our barley, and even all our grain of every kind, and one
half of the increase of our flocks and our herds; and even one half of
all we have or possess the king of the Lamanites doth exact of us, or
our lives.

7:23 And now, is not this grievous to be borne? And is not this, our
affliction, great? Now <95 how great reason we have to mourn.

7:24 Yea, I say unto you, <15 are the reasons <379 we have to mourn;
for behold how many of our brethren have been slain, and their blood
has been spilt in vain, and all <268 of iniquity.

7:25 For if this <161 had not fallen into transgression the Lord
would not have suffered that this <56 evil <363 come upon <334 But
<81 they <16 not hearken unto his words; but <439 arose
contentions among them, even so much that they did shed <64 <10
themselves.

7:26 And a prophet of the Lord have they slain; yea, a chosen man of
God, who told them of <93 wickedness and abominations, and prophesied
of many <401 <120 are to come, yea, even the coming of Christ.

7:27 And <108 he said unto them that Christ was the God, the Father
of all things, and said that he <101 take upon him the image of man,
and it <11 be the <9 after <51 man was created in the
beginning; or in other words, he said that man was <14 <19 the
<23 of God, and that God <32 come down <118 the children of men,
and take upon him flesh and blood, and go forth upon the face of the
earth—

7:28 And now, <95 he said <260 they did put him to death; and many
more <125 did they do <77 <480 down the wrath of God upon <199
Therefore, who wondereth that they are in bondage, and that they are
smitten with sore afflictions?

7:29 For <220 the Lord hath said: I will not succor my <253 in the
day of <186 transgression; but I will hedge up <7 ways that they
prosper not; and <8 doings shall be as a stumbling block before
<65

7:30 And again, he saith: If my <42 <20 sow filthiness they <4
reap the chaff thereof in the whirlwind; and the effect <7 is
poison.

7:31 And again he <31 If my <31 <27 sow <31 they <4
reap the east wind, <126 bringeth immediate destruction.

7:32 And now, <104 the promise of the Lord is fulfilled, and ye are
<125 and afflicted.

7:33 But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and
put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye
do <202 he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you
out of bondage.

Mosiah Chapter 8

8:1 And it came to pass that <278 king Limhi had made an end of
speaking to his people, for he spake many <240 unto them and only a
few of them have I written in this book, he told his <140 all the
<23 concerning <198 <498 who were in the land of Zarahemla.

8:2 And he caused that Ammon <329 stand up <211 the multitude, and
rehearse unto them all that had happened unto <34 <34 from the
time that Zeniff went up out of the land even until the time that he
himself came up out of the land.

8:3 And he also rehearsed unto them the last words <210 king Benjamin
had taught them, and explained them to the <93 of king Limhi, so
that they might understand all the <25 <25 he spake.

8:4 And it came to pass that <155 he had done all <192 that king
<162 dismissed the <102 and <112 that they <112 return every
one unto his own house.

8:5 And it came to pass that he <23 that the plates <54 contained
the record of his <74 from the time that they left the land of
Zarahemla, <43 be <435 <155 Ammon, that he <85 read <370

8:6 Now, as soon as <174 had read the record, the king inquired of him
to know if he could interpret languages, and <19 told him that he
<10 not.

8:7 And the king said unto him: Being grieved for the afflictions of my
<266 I <88 that forty and three of my <84 <73 take a
journey into the wilderness, that thereby they <77 find the land of
<91 that we <9 appeal unto our <235 to <336 us out of
<336

8:8 And they were lost in the wilderness for the space of many days,
yet they were diligent, and found not the land of Zarahemla but
returned to this land, having traveled in a land among many waters,
<9 discovered a land <172 was covered with bones of men, and of
beasts, and was also <12 with ruins of buildings of <214 kind,
<27 <27 a land <27 had been peopled with a <114 who were
as numerous as the hosts of Israel.

8:9 And for a testimony that the <382 that they had said are true
they have <215 twenty-four <239 <40 are filled with engravings,
and they are of pure gold.

8:10 And behold, also, they have <24 breastplates, <23 are large,
and they are of brass and of copper, and are perfectly sound.

8:11 And again, they have <26 swords, the hilts thereof have
perished, and the blades <7 were cankered with rust; and there is
no one in the land that is able to <262 the language or the
engravings that are on the plates. Therefore I said unto thee: Canst
thou translate?

8:12 And I say unto thee again: Knowest thou of any one that can
<19 For I am desirous that these records <270 be translated
into our language; for, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of a
remnant of the <178 who have been destroyed, from whence <30
<31 came; or, <25 they will give us a <25 of this very
<23 who have been destroyed; and I am <56 to know the cause of
their destruction.

8:13 Now <372 said unto him: I can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a
man that can translate the records; for he has wherewith that he can
look, and <13 all <68 that are of ancient date; and it is a
gift from God. And the <250 are called interpreters, and no man can
look in them except he be commanded, lest he <132 look for that he
ought not and he <10 perish. And whosoever is commanded to look in
them, the same is <40 seer.

8:14 And <269 the king of the <124 who are in the land of
<386 is the man that is <35 to do <157 things, and who has
this high gift from God.

8:15 And the king said that a seer is greater than a prophet.

8:16 And <151 said that a seer is a revelator and a prophet also; and
a gift <333 is <27 can no man have, <114 he <100 possess the
power of God, <16 no man can; yet a man may have great <13 given
him from God.

8:17 But a seer can know of <161 <27 are past, and also of <7
<8 are to come, and by them shall all <11 be revealed, or,
rather, <8 secret <8 be made manifest, and hidden <6 <9
come to light, and <7 <31 are not known <11 be made <4 by
<173 and also <14 <10 be made <10 by them <20 otherwise could
not be known.

8:18 Thus God has provided a means that man, through faith, might work
mighty miracles; therefore he becometh a <107 benefit to his fellow
beings.

8:19 And now, when <162 had made an end of speaking <201 words the
king rejoiced exceedingly, and gave thanks to God, saying: Doubtless a
<37 mystery is contained within <21 plates, and <3 interpreters
were doubtless prepared for the purpose of unfolding all such mysteries
to the children of men.

8:20 O how marvelous are the works of the Lord, and how long doth he
suffer with his people; yea, and how blind and impenetrable are the
understandings of the <38 of men; for they will not seek wisdom,
neither do they desire that she <239 rule over them!

8:21 Yea, they are as a wild flock <161 fleeth from the shepherd, and
scattereth, and are driven, and are devoured by the beasts of the
forest.

Mosiah Chapter 9

9:1 I, Zeniff, having been taught in all the language of the Nephites,
and <12 had a <505 of the land of Nephi, or of the land of our
fathers’ first inheritance, and <20 been sent as a spy among the
Lamanites that I <217 spy out their forces, that our army <8 come
upon them and destroy them—but when I saw that <97 was good <29
them I was desirous that they <123 not be destroyed.

9:2 Therefore, I contended with my brethren in the wilderness for I
would that our ruler <24 make a treaty with them; but he being an
austere and a bloodthirsty man <462 that I <19 be slain; but I
was rescued by the shedding of much blood; for father fought against
father, and brother <5 brother, until the <438 number of our
army was destroyed in the wilderness; and we returned, those of us that
were spared, to the land of Zarahemla, to relate that tale to <128
wives and <4 children.

9:3 And yet, I <81 over-zealous to inherit the land of our fathers,
collected as many as were <131 to go up to <494 the land, and
started again on our journey into the <129 to go up to the land;
but we were smitten with famine and sore afflictions; for we were slow
to remember the Lord our God.

9:4 Nevertheless, after many days’ wandering in the <39 we
pitched our tents in the place where our <182 were slain, <209 was
near to the land of our fathers.

9:5 And it came to pass that I went <81 with four of my men into the
city, in unto the king, that I <259 know of the disposition of the
<11 and that I <12 know if I <4 go in with my people and <126
the land in peace.

9:6 And I went in unto the <31 and he covenanted with me that I <31
<26 the land of Lehi-Nephi, and the land of Shilom.

9:7 And he also <262 that his <48 <263 depart out of the
<177 and I and my <12 went into the land that we <41 <40 it.

9:8 And we began to build buildings, and to repair the walls of the
<116 yea, even the <8 of the city of <65 and the city of
<66

9:9 And we <34 to till the ground, yea, even with all manner of
seeds, with seeds of corn, and of wheat, and of barley, and with neas,
and with sheum, and with <18 of all <26 of fruits; and we did
begin to multiply and prosper in the land.

9:10 Now it was the cunning and the craftiness of king Laman, to bring
my <119 into bondage, that he yielded up the land that we <123
<124 it.

9:11 Therefore it came to pass, that <283 we had dwelt in the land for
the space of twelve years that king Laman <111 to grow uneasy, lest by
any means my <52 <183 wax strong in the <182 and that they could
not overpower them and <71 them into bondage.

9:12 Now they were a lazy and an idolatrous people; therefore they were
<397 to <23 us into <92 that they <86 glut themselves with
the labors of our hands; yea, that they <13 feast <13 upon the
flocks of our fields.

9:13 <105 it came to pass that king <90 <90 to stir up his
<86 that they <88 contend with my <61 <61 there <16
to be wars and contentions in the <177

9:14 For, in the thirteenth year of my reign in the land of Nephi, away
on the south of the land of Shilom, when my <49 were watering and
feeding their flocks, and tilling <4 lands, a numerous host of
Lamanites came upon them and <61 to slay them, and to take off <20
<25 and the corn of <7 <106

9:15 Yea, and it came to pass that they fled, all that were not
overtaken, even into the city of <76 and did call upon me for
protection.

9:16 And it came to pass that I did arm them with bows, and with
arrows, with swords, and with cimeters, and with clubs, and with
slings, and with all <328 of weapons which we <237 invent, and I and
my <119 did go forth against the <108 to battle.

9:17 Yea, in the strength of the Lord did we go <20 to battle <22
the Lamanites; for I and my <34 did cry mightily to the Lord that he
would deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, for we were awakened
to a remembrance of the deliverance of our fathers.

9:18 And God did hear our cries and did answer our prayers; and we did
go <65 in his might; yea, we did go <8 <71 the Lamanites, and
in one day and a night we did slay three thousand and forty-three; we
did slay them even until we had driven them out of our <278

9:19 And I, myself, with mine own hands, did help to bury <227 dead.
And behold, to our great sorrow and lamentation, two hundred and
seventy-nine of our brethren were slain.

Mosiah Chapter 10

10:1 And it came to pass that we again <281 to establish the kingdom
and we <9 <9 to <488 the land in peace. And I caused that
<364 <371 be <218 of war made of every kind, that thereby I <414
have <13 for my <190 <128 the time the <223 <24 come
up <42 to war <12 my people.

10:2 And I set guards round about the <499 that the <25 <37
not come upon us <27 unawares and destroy us; and thus I did guard my
<49 and my <363 and keep them from falling into the <234 of our
enemies.

10:3 And it came to pass that we did inherit the land of our fathers
for many years, yea, for the space of twenty and two years.

10:4 And I did cause that the men <101 till the ground, and raise all
<351 of grain and all <5 of fruit of <135 kind.

10:5 And I did <30 that the women <30 spin, and toil, and work,
and work all <27 of fine linen, yea, and cloth of <31 <166 that
we <129 clothe our nakedness; and thus we did prosper in the land—thus
we did have continual peace in the land for the <93 of <93 and two
<94

10:6 And it came to pass that king Laman died, and his son <237 to
reign in his stead. And he <9 to stir his <170 up in rebellion
<211 my people; therefore they <14 to prepare for war, and to come
up to <439 <17 my <228

10:7 But I had sent my spies out <231 <231 the land of Shemlon, that
I <104 discover <345 preparations, that I <6 <225 <31 them,
that they <7 not come upon my <63 and <244 them.

10:8 And it came to pass that they came up upon the north of the land
of Shilom, with <43 numerous hosts, men armed with bows, and with
arrows, and with swords, and with cimeters, and with stones, and with
slings; and they had <27 heads shaved that they were naked; and they
were girded with a leathern girdle <96 <17 loins.

10:9 And it came to pass that I <388 that the <233 and children of
my <93 <239 be hid in the wilderness; and I also <19 that all
my old men that could bear arms, and also all my young men that were
able to bear <13 <33 gather themselves together to go to <176
<146 the Lamanites; and I did place them in <74 ranks, <274 man
according to his age.

10:10 And it came to pass that we did go up to <35 <34 the
<35 and I, even I, in my old age, did go up to <17 <17
the Lamanites. And it came to pass that we did go up in the strength of
the Lord to battle.

10:11 Now, the <468 knew nothing concerning the Lord, nor the
<22 of the <7 <284 they depended upon <88 own strength.
Yet they were a strong people, as to the <21 of men.

10:12 They were a wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty <20
believing in the tradition of <36 fathers, which is this—Believing
that they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem because of the
iniquities of <22 <22 and that they were wronged in the
wilderness by <12 brethren, and they were also <12 while crossing
the sea;

10:13 And again, that they were <15 <15 in the land of <27
first inheritance, after they had crossed the sea, and all this <58
that Nephi was more faithful in keeping the commandments of the
Lord—therefore he was favored of the <135 for the Lord heard his
prayers and answered <382 and he took the lead of <50 journey in the
wilderness.

10:14 And his brethren were wroth with him <54 they understood not
the dealings of the Lord; they were also <16 with him upon the waters
<20 they hardened <40 hearts <235 the Lord.

10:15 And <110 they were <23 with him when they had arrived in the
promised land, <28 they said that he had taken the ruling of the
<364 out of <40 hands; and they sought to kill him.

10:16 And <43 they were <43 with him <34 he departed into the
<184 as the Lord had commanded him, and took the records <225
were engraven on the plates of brass, for they said that he robbed
<509

10:17 And thus they have taught <62 <434 that they <399 hate
<156 and that they <7 murder <6 and that they <6 rob and
plunder <9 and do all they <438 to destroy them; <324 they
have an eternal hatred towards the <39 of Nephi.

10:18 For this very cause has king Laman, by his cunning, and lying
craftiness, and his fair promises, deceived me, that I have brought
this my <139 up into this <156 that they may <53 <53 yea, and
we have suffered these many years in the land.

10:19 And now I, Zeniff, <292 having told all <18 things unto my
<39 <417 the Lamanites, I did stimulate them to go to <460
with <127 might, putting <3 trust in the <250 therefore, we did
contend with <119 face to face.

10:20 And it came to pass that we did drive them again out of our land;
and we slew them with a great slaughter, even so many that we did not
number <192

10:21 And it came to pass that we returned <36 to our own <121 and
my <90 <9 began to tend <78 flocks, and to till <5 ground.

10:22 And now I, being old, did confer the kingdom upon one of my sons;
<99 I say no more. And may the Lord bless my people. Amen.

Mosiah Chapter 11

11:1 And now it came to pass that Zeniff conferred the <40 upon
Noah, one of his <42 <244 Noah <72 to reign in his stead; and
he did not walk in the ways of his father.

11:2 For behold, he did not keep the <475 of God, but he did
walk <210 the desires of his own heart. And he had many wives and
concubines. And he did <282 his <131 to commit sin, and do that
<368 was abominable in the sight of the <448 Yea, and they did <19
whoredoms and all manner of wickedness.

11:3 And he laid a tax of one fifth part of all they possessed, a <7
part of <172 gold and of <4 silver, and a <12 part of <7 ziff,
and of <5 copper, and of <4 brass and <3 iron; and a <19
part of <8 fatlings; and also a <9 part of all <9 grain.

11:4 And all this did he take to support himself, and his <117 and his
concubines; and also his priests, and <27 <11 and <3 <10
thus he had changed the affairs of the kingdom.

11:5 For he put down all the priests that had been consecrated by his
father, and <6 new ones in <36 stead, such as were lifted up
in the pride of <12 hearts.

11:6 Yea, and thus they were supported in <13 laziness, and in <4
idolatry, and in <5 whoredoms, by the taxes <188 king Noah had put
upon his people; thus did the <208 labor exceedingly to <108
iniquity.

11:7 Yea, and they also became idolatrous, because they were <497
by the vain and flattering words of the king and priests; for they did
speak <12 <472 unto <401

11:8 And it came to pass that king Noah built many elegant and spacious
buildings; and he ornamented them with fine work of wood, and of all
<256 of precious things, of gold, and of <234 and of iron, and of
brass, and of <237 and of copper;

11:9 And he also <49 him a <48 palace, and a throne in the midst
thereof, all of <130 was of fine wood and was <62 with gold and
silver and with <57 things.

11:10 And he also caused that his workmen should work all <75 of
fine work within the walls of the temple, of fine <93 and of <305
and of brass.

11:11 And the seats <59 were set apart for the high <276 <8
were above all the other seats, he did ornament with pure gold; and he
<60 a breastwork to be <104 before them, that they might rest <231
bodies and <4 arms upon while they <77 <187 lying and vain <201
to his people.

11:12 And it came to pass that he <37 a tower near the temple; yea, a
very high tower, even so high that he could stand upon the top thereof
and overlook the land of Shilom, and also the land of Shemlon, <95
was possessed by the Lamanites; and he <28 even look over all the
land round about.

11:13 And it came to pass that he <108 many buildings to be <71 in
the land Shilom; and he <13 a great <80 to be <14 on the hill
north of the land <65 <59 had been a resort for the children of
Nephi at the time they fled out of the land; and thus he did do with
the riches <29 he obtained by the taxation of his <144

11:14 And it came to pass that he placed his heart upon his riches, and
he spent his time in riotous living with his <494 and his <494
and so did also his <480 spend <199 time with harlots.

11:15 And it came to pass that he planted vineyards <137 about in the
<81 and he <113 wine-presses, and made wine in abundance; and
therefore he <438 a wine-bibber, and also his <83

11:16 And it came to pass that the Lamanites began to come in upon his
people, upon small numbers, and to slay them in <71 fields, and <270
they were tending <8 flocks.

11:17 And king Noah sent guards <73 <73 the land to keep them off;
but he did not send a sufficient number, and the <55 came upon
them and killed <324 and drove many of <42 flocks out of the <104
thus the <21 <76 to destroy <18 and to exercise <17 hatred
upon them.

11:18 And it came to pass that king Noah sent his armies against <25
and they were driven back, or they <50 them back for a time;
therefore, they returned rejoicing in <42 spoil.

11:19 And now, because of this <283 victory they were lifted up in the
pride of <22 hearts; they did boast in <6 own strength, saying
that <6 fifty <344 <372 <60 thousands of the <353 and
thus they did boast, and did delight in blood, and the shedding of the
blood of <28 brethren, and this <58 of the wickedness of <9
king and priests.

11:20 And it came to pass that there was a man among them whose name
was Abinadi; and he went forth <11 <123 and <153 to prophesy,
saying: Behold, thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me,
saying, Go forth, and say unto this <246 thus <19 the Lord—Wo be
unto this <9 for I have seen <71 abominations, and <3
wickedness, and <4 whoredoms; and except they repent I will visit
them in mine anger.

11:21 And <16 they <16 and turn to the Lord <27 God, behold, I
will deliver them into the hands of <12 enemies; yea, and they shall
be brought into bondage; and they <8 be afflicted by the hand of
<21 enemies.

11:22 And it <16 come to pass that they <6 know that I am the Lord
<22 God, and am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of my <381

11:23 And it <27 come to pass that <87 this people <88 and turn
unto the Lord <34 God, they <18 be <74 into <74 and none
<8 <95 <176 <24 it be the Lord the Almighty God.

11:24 Yea, and it <18 come to pass that when they <7 cry unto me I
will be slow to hear <47 cries; yea, and I will suffer them that they
be smitten by <14 <117

11:25 And <54 they <77 in sackcloth and ashes, and cry mightily
to the Lord <21 God, I will not hear <6 prayers, neither will I
<82 them out of <10 afflictions; and thus <237 the <256 and
thus hath he <257 me.

11:26 Now it came to pass that when Abinadi had spoken these words unto
them they were wroth with him, and sought to take away his life; but
the Lord delivered him out of <53 hands.

11:27 Now when king Noah had heard of the <38 which <44 had
<45 unto the <301 he was also wroth; and he said: Who is Abinadi,
that I and my <197 should be judged of him, or who is the <95 that
<166 bring upon my <17 such <462 affliction?

11:28 I command you to <15 <52 hither, that I may slay him, for
he has said <105 things that he might stir up my <33 to anger one
with another, and to raise contentions <414 my people; therefore I
will slay him.

11:29 Now the eyes of the <29 were blinded; <18 they hardened
<124 hearts <504 the <114 of <98 and they <147 from that
time forward to take him. And king Noah <23 his heart <22 the
word of the <106 and he did not <240 of his evil doings.

Mosiah Chapter 12

12:1 And it came to pass that after the space of two years that <119
came <91 them in disguise, that they knew him not, and <512 to
prophesy <14 <343 saying: Thus has the Lord <252 me,
saying—Abinadi, go and <14 unto this my <199 for they have
<81 <103 <103 <81 my words; they have repented not of <10
evil doings; therefore, I will <503 them in my anger, yea, in my
fierce <164 will I <13 them in <23 <437 and abominations.

12:2 Yea, wo be unto this generation! And the Lord said unto me:
Stretch forth thy hand and <69 <81 Thus <338 the <137 it
<243 come to pass that this generation, because of <43 iniquities,
<12 be <454 into bondage, and <6 be <406 on the cheek; yea,
and <9 be driven by men, and <6 be slain; and the vultures of the
air, and the dogs, yea, and the wild beasts, <18 devour <44 flesh.

12:3 And it <10 come to pass that the life of king Noah <10 be
valued even as a garment in a hot furnace; for he <14 know that I am
the Lord.

12:4 And it <14 come to pass that I will smite this my <286 with
sore afflictions, yea, with famine and with pestilence; and I will
cause that they <28 howl all the day long.

12:5 Yea, and I will <17 that they <17 have burdens lashed upon
<97 backs; and they <10 be <127 before like a dumb ass.

12:6 And it <14 come to pass that I will send <188 hail <268 <268
and it <15 <78 them; and they <5 also be <171 with the east
wind; and insects <11 pester <51 land also, and <153 <5 grain.

12:7 And they <15 be <25 with a <456 pestilence—and all this
will I do <220 of <23 <263 and <263

12:8 And it <25 come to pass that except they <381 I will utterly
destroy them from off the face of the earth; yet they <23 leave a
record behind <89 and I will preserve them for other nations which
<17 possess the land; yea, even this will I do that I may discover
the abominations of this <189 to <25 nations. And many things did
<414 <316 <374 this people.

12:9 And it came to pass that they were angry with him; and they took
him and carried him bound <179 the king, and said unto the king:
Behold, we have <334 a man <15 thee who has prophesied evil
concerning thy <433 and <367 that God will <115 them.

12:10 And he also prophesieth evil <19 thy life, and <19 that
thy life <107 be as a <312 in a furnace of fire.

12:11 And again, he <22 that thou shalt be as a stalk, even as a dry
stalk of the field, <143 is run over by the beasts and trodden under
foot.

12:12 And <36 he <36 thou <35 be as the blossoms of a thistle,
which, when it is fully ripe, if the wind bloweth, it is <306 <287
upon the face of the land. And he pretendeth the Lord hath spoken it.
And he <43 all this <99 come upon thee <245 thou repent, and this
<268 of thine iniquities.

12:13 And now, O <168 what <289 evil hast thou done, or what <7
sins have thy <222 committed, that we should be condemned of God or
judged of this man?

12:14 And now, O <36 behold, we are guiltless, and thou, O <8 hast
not sinned; therefore, this man has lied <183 you, and he has
<211 in vain.

12:15 And <31 we are strong, we <94 not come into bondage, or be
taken captive by our enemies; yea, and thou hast prospered in the land,
and thou <162 also prosper.

12:16 <265 here is the man, we deliver him into thy hands; thou
mayest do with him as seemeth thee good.

12:17 And it came to pass that king Noah caused that <338 <122 be
cast into prison; and he commanded that the priests <12 gather
themselves together that he might hold a council with them what he
<16 do with him.

12:18 And it came to pass that they said unto the <349 Bring him
hither that we may question him; and the king <51 that he <34
be <363 <361 <346

12:19 And they began to <22 him, that they <61 cross him, that
thereby they <7 have wherewith to accuse him; but he answered them
boldly, and withstood all their questions, yea, to <4 astonishment;
for he did withstand them in all <10 <14 and did confound them
in all <9 words.

12:20 And it came to pass that one of them said unto him: What meaneth
the words <374 are written, and <4 have been taught by our fathers,
saying:

12:21 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
bringeth good tidings; that publisheth peace; that <7 good
tidings of good; that <10 salvation; that <358 unto Zion, Thy
God reigneth;

12:22 Thy watchmen <274 lift up the voice; with the voice <199
<10 they sing; for they <5 see eye to eye when the Lord <8
bring again Zion;

12:23 Break <423 into joy; sing <29 ye waste places of Jerusalem;
for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed <12

12:24 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
nations, and all the ends of the earth <59 see the salvation of our
God?

12:25 And now <304 said unto them: Are you priests, and pretend to
teach this <59 and to understand the spirit of prophesying, and yet
desire to know of me what these things mean?

12:26 I say unto you, wo be unto you for perverting the ways of the
Lord! For if ye <40 <27 <27 ye have not <210 them;
<459 ye have perverted the ways of the Lord.

12:27 Ye have not applied your hearts to understanding; <21 ye
have not been wise. Therefore, what <84 ye this people?

12:28 And they said: We <12 the law of Moses.

12:29 And <187 he said unto <118 If ye <17 the law of Moses why do
ye not keep it? Why do ye set your <58 upon riches? Why do ye commit
whoredoms and spend your strength with harlots, yea, and cause this
people to <16 sin, that the Lord has <11 to send me to prophesy
against this <165 yea, even a great evil <8 this <88

12:30 Know ye not that I speak the truth? Yea, ye know that I <8 the
truth; and you ought to tremble <450 God.

12:31 And it <235 come to pass that ye <6 be smitten for your
iniquities, for ye have said that ye <116 the law of <133 And what
know ye concerning the law of Moses? Doth <267 come by the law of
<9 What say ye?

12:32 And they <481 and said that <21 did come by the law of
<41

12:33 But now <292 said unto <174 I know if ye keep the
commandments of God ye <80 be saved; yea, if ye keep the <12
<468 the Lord delivered unto <194 in the mount of Sinai, <471

12:34 I am the Lord thy God, who hath brought thee out of the land of
Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

12:35 Thou shalt have no other God <153 me.

12:36 Thou <12 not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness
of any thing in heaven above, or <334 <76 are in the <412 beneath.

12:37 Now <112 said unto them, Have ye done all this? I say unto
you, Nay, ye have not. And have ye <363 this <266 that they should
do all <377 things? I say unto you, Nay, ye have not.

Mosiah Chapter 13

13:1 And now when the king had heard <27 words, he said unto his
priests: Away with this fellow, and slay him; for what have we to do
with him, for he is mad.

13:2 And they stood forth and attempted to lay their hands on him; but
he withstood <102 and said unto <218

13:3 Touch me not, for God <216 smite you if ye lay your <28 upon
me, for I have not <218 the message <148 the Lord sent me to
deliver; neither have I told you that <14 ye requested that I <130
tell; <477 God will not suffer that I <47 be destroyed at this
time.

13:4 But I must fulfil the <271 wherewith God has commanded me;
and because I have told you the truth ye are angry with me. And again,
<15 I have spoken the word of God ye have judged me that I am mad.

13:5 Now it came to pass after <231 had <25 <177 words that the
<216 of king Noah durst not lay <149 <121 on him, for the Spirit of
the Lord was upon him; and his face shone with exceeding luster, even
as Moses’ did while in the <354 of <354 <6 speaking with the
Lord.

13:6 And he spake with power and authority from God; and he continued
his <244 <379

13:7 Ye see that ye have not <22 to slay me, therefore I finish my
message. Yea, and I perceive that it cuts you to your hearts <130 I
tell you the <145 <496 your iniquities.

13:8 Yea, and my <117 fill you with wonder and amazement, and with
anger.

13:9 But I <49 my message; and then it matters not whither I go, if
it so be that I am saved.

13:10 But this much I tell you, what you do with me, <174 this, <240
be as a type and a shadow of <428 <266 are to come.

13:11 And now I read unto you the remainder of the <253 of God,
for I <114 that they are not written in your hearts; I <10
that ye have studied and <437 iniquity the most part of your lives.

13:12 And now, ye remember that I said unto you: Thou <74 not make
unto thee any <512 <512 or any <512 of <77 <77 are in
heaven above, or <7 are in the <512 beneath, or <7 are in the
water under the earth.

13:13 And again: Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto <425 nor serve
them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities
of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generations
of them that hate me;

13:14 And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my
commandments.

13:15 Thou <67 not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the
Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

13:16 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

13:17 Six days <45 thou labor, and do all thy work;

13:18 But the seventh day, the <29 of the Lord thy God, thou <24
not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant,
nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within
thy gates;

13:19 For in six days the Lord made <204 and earth, and the sea, and
all that in them is; wherefore the Lord blessed the <67 day, and
hallowed it.

13:20 Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon
the land <238 the Lord thy God giveth thee.

13:21 Thou <98 not kill.

13:22 Thou <8 not commit adultery. Thou <5 not steal.

13:23 Thou <8 not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

13:24 Thou <13 not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou <7 not <7
thy <8 wife, nor his <134 nor his <133 nor his
ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor’s.

13:25 And it came to pass that <431 Abinadi had made an end of these
sayings that he said unto them: Have ye <394 this people that they
should observe to do all <21 <371 for to keep <5 commandments?

13:26 I say unto you, Nay; for if ye had, the Lord would not have
caused me to come forth and to prophesy evil concerning this people.

13:27 And now ye have said that salvation cometh by the law of Moses. I
say unto you that it is expedient that ye <71 keep the law of Moses
as yet; but I say unto you, that the time <466 come when it <4 no
more be <29 to keep the law of <44

13:28 And moreover, I say unto you, that <62 doth not come by the
law alone; and were it not for the atonement, <243 God himself <42
make for the sins and <452 of his people, that they must
unavoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of <52

13:29 And now I say unto you that it was <72 that there <101 be
a law given to the children of Israel, yea, even a very strict law; for
they were a stiffnecked <51 quick to do iniquity, and slow to
remember the Lord their God;

13:30 Therefore <43 was a law <41 them, yea, a law of performances
and of ordinances, a law <100 they were to <234 strictly from day
to day, to keep them in remembrance of God and <43 duty towards him.

13:31 But behold, I say unto you, that all <256 <261 were types of
<5 to come.

13:32 And now, did they understand the law? I say unto you, Nay, they
did not all <13 the law; and this because of the hardness of
<57 hearts; for they understood not that <100 could not any man be
saved except it were through the redemption of God.

13:33 For <76 did not <262 <301 unto them <302 the
coming of the Messiah, and that God <180 redeem his people? Yea, and
even all the prophets who have prophesied ever since the world
began—have they not spoken more or less <36 <113 things?

13:34 Have they not said that God <258 <40 come down among the
<218 of men, and take upon him the form of man, and go <376 in
mighty power upon the face of the earth?

13:35 Yea, and have they not said also that he <43 bring to pass the
resurrection of the dead, and that he, himself, <14 be oppressed and
afflicted?

Mosiah Chapter 14

14:1 Yea, even doth not Isaiah say: Who hath believed our report, and
to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?

14:2 For he <359 grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root
out of dry ground; he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we <27
see him <210 is no beauty that we <81 desire him.

14:3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and
acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was
despised, and we esteemed him not.

14:4 Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we
did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

14:5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his
stripes we are healed.

14:6 All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned every one to
his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.

14:7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his
mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep <200
her shearers is dumb so he <26 not his mouth.

14:8 He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who <202 declare
his generation? For he was cut off out of the land of the living; for
the transgressions of my people was he stricken.

14:9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his
death; <468 he had done no evil, neither was any deceit in his
<75

14:10 Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to <248
when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he <91 see his
seed, he <6 prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord <10
prosper in his hand.

14:11 He <11 see the travail of his soul, and <8 be satisfied; by
his knowledge <7 my righteous servant justify many; for he <8
bear their iniquities.

14:12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he
<22 <11 the spoil with the strong; <123 he hath poured out his
soul unto <133 and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he
bore the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

<468 <468 15

15:1 And now Abinadi said unto them: I would that ye <413 understand
that God himself <64 come down among the children of men, and <9
redeem his people.

15:2 And <76 he dwelleth in flesh he <16 be called the Son of
God, and having subjected the <14 to the will of the Father, being
the Father and the Son—

15:3 The <13 <38 he was conceived by the power of God; and the
Son, <13 of the flesh; thus becoming the <30 and <29

15:4 And they are one God, yea, the very Eternal <16 of heaven and
of earth.

15:5 And thus the <70 <33 subject to the Spirit, or the Son to
the <63 <76 one God, suffereth temptation, and yieldeth not to
the <7 but <10 <135 to be mocked, and scourged, and
cast out, and disowned by his <135

15:6 And after all this, <3 working many mighty miracles <159 the
<160 of men, he <144 be led, yea, even as Isaiah said, as a <433
<434 the shearer is dumb, so he <433 not his <358

15:7 Yea, even so he <31 be led, crucified, and slain, the <100
<101 <101 even unto death, the will of the Son <99 swallowed
up in the will of the Father.

15:8 And thus God breaketh the bands of <27 <207 gained the
victory over <295 giving the Son <188 to make <284 for the
<93 of men—

15:9 Having ascended into heaven, <28 the bowels of mercy; <55
filled with compassion towards the <23 of men; standing betwixt
them and justice; <21 broken the <55 of <55 taken upon <164
<383 iniquity and <3 transgressions, <15 redeemed them, and
satisfied the demands of justice.

15:10 And now I say unto you, who <126 declare his generation? Behold,
I say unto you, that when his soul has been made an <484 for sin he
<23 see his seed. And now what say ye? And who <11 be his seed?

15:11 Behold I say unto you, that whosoever has heard the words of the
prophets, yea, all the holy prophets who have prophesied concerning the
coming of the Lord—I say unto you, that all those who have hearkened
unto <106 words, and believed that the Lord <425 <406 his people,
and have looked forward to that day for a remission of <23 sins, I
say unto you, that these are his seed, or they are heirs of the kingdom
of God.

15:12 For <19 are they whose sins he has borne; <8 are they for
whom he has died, to <60 them from <48 transgressions. And now,
are they not his <126

15:13 Yea, and are not the <117 every one that has <316 his
mouth to prophesy, that has not fallen into transgression, I mean all
the holy <135 ever since the world began? I say unto you that they
are his <185

15:14 And <76 are they who have published peace, who have brought
good tidings of good, who have <12 salvation; and said unto Zion:
Thy God reigneth!

15:15 And O how beautiful upon the mountains were <102 feet!

15:16 And again, how <14 upon the <14 are the feet of <196
that are still publishing peace!

15:17 And <22 how <22 upon the <22 are the feet of <22
who <264 hereafter publish <78 yea, from this time henceforth and
forever!

15:18 And behold, I say unto you, this is not all. For O how <40
upon the <41 are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that
is the founder of <46 yea, even the Lord, who has <374 his
people; yea, him who has granted salvation unto his <9

15:19 For were it not for the redemption which he hath made for his
<292 <8 was prepared from the foundation of the world, I say unto
you, were it not for this, all mankind must have perished.

15:20 But <100 the <450 of death <122 be broken, and the Son
reigneth, and hath <505 over the dead; therefore, he <98 to pass
the resurrection of the dead.

15:21 And there cometh a resurrection, even a first resurrection; yea,
even a <21 of <169 that have been, and who are, and who <53
be, even until the <17 of Christ—for so <10 he be called.

15:22 And now, the <15 of all the <325 and all <37 that
have <419 in <251 <424 or all <10 that have kept the
commandments of God, <37 come forth in the <69 <69
<94 they are the <7 resurrection.

15:23 They are raised to dwell with God who has <193 them; thus
they have eternal life through Christ, who has broken the <144 of
death.

15:24 And <353 are <61 who have part in the <46 <53 and
<12 are they that have died before Christ came, in <85 ignorance,
not having <234 declared unto them. And thus the Lord <169
about the restoration of these; and they have a part in the <41
<168 or have <71 life, being <80 by the Lord.

15:25 And little children also have <16 life.

15:26 But <232 and fear, and tremble <64 God, for ye ought to
tremble; for the Lord redeemeth none such that rebel against him and
die in <82 sins; yea, even all <107 that have perished in <10 sins
ever <490 the <490 began, that have wilfully rebelled <28 God,
that have known the <186 of God, and would not keep <162 <129
are they that have no part in the <102 <189

15:27 Therefore <72 ye not to tremble? For <137 <284 to none
such; for the Lord hath <117 none <7 yea, neither can the Lord
redeem <8 for he cannot deny himself; for he <5 deny justice
when it has its claim.

15:28 And now I say unto you that the time <264 come that the
<55 of the Lord <9 be <197 to every nation, kindred,
tongue, and people.

15:29 Yea, <458 thy watchmen <19 lift up <131 voice; with the voice
together <10 they sing; for they <5 see eye to eye, when the Lord
<9 bring again Zion.

15:30 Break <323 into joy, sing together, ye waste places of
Jerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted his <477 he hath <121
Jerusalem.

15:31 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
nations; and all the ends of the earth <59 see the <109 of our
God.

Mosiah Chapter 16

16:1 And now, it came to pass that after Abinadi had spoken <213 words
he stretched <84 his hand and said: The time <41 come when all
<5 see the <46 of the Lord; when <152 <152 <152
<152 and people <15 see eye to eye and <6 confess <312 God
that his judgments are just.

16:2 And then <16 the wicked be cast out, and they <8 have cause
to howl, and weep, and wail, and gnash <183 teeth; and this because
they <298 not hearken unto the <191 of the <66 therefore the Lord
<355 them not.

16:3 For they are carnal and devilish, and the devil has power over
<328 yea, even that old serpent that did beguile our <327 parents,
which was the <66 of <58 fall; <7 was the <7 of all mankind
becoming carnal, sensual, <39 knowing evil from good, subjecting
themselves to the devil.

16:4 Thus all <22 were lost; and <443 they <87 have been
endlessly lost were it not that God <238 his <150 from <51 lost
and fallen state.

16:5 But remember that he that persists in his own <98 nature, and
goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion <443 God, remaineth in his
<34 state and the <116 hath all <117 over him. Therefore, he is as
though there was no redemption made, being an enemy to God; and also is
the <27 an <10 to God.

16:6 And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of things
to come as <42 they had already come, <46 could have been no
redemption.

16:7 And if <32 had not risen from the dead, or have broken the
bands of death that the grave should have no victory, and that <10
<8 have no sting, <43 <43 have been no resurrection.

16:8 But <11 is a resurrection, <251 the <30 hath no <29
and the sting of <32 is swallowed up in Christ.

16:9 He is the light and the life of the world; yea, a <9 that is
endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also a life <255 is
<14 that <57 can be no more death.

16:10 Even this mortal <345 put on immortality, and this corruption
<8 put on incorruption, and <5 be brought to stand <385 the bar
of God, to be judged of him according to <255 works whether they be
good or <6 they be evil—

16:11 If they be <308 to the resurrection of endless life and
happiness; and if they be evil, to the <14 of <14
damnation, <237 delivered up to the devil, who hath subjected them,
<101 is damnation—

16:12 Having gone <63 to <63 own <301 wills and desires;
having <128 called upon the Lord while the arms of mercy were extended
towards <409 for the arms of <10 were <10 <9 <44 and
they <368 not; they <60 warned of <41 iniquities and yet they
<12 not depart from <29 and they were commanded to repent and yet
they <15 not repent.

16:13 And now, ought ye not to tremble and <20 of your sins, and
<390 that only in and through <294 ye can be saved?

16:14 <368 if ye teach the law of Moses, also <6 that it is a
shadow of those <344 <128 are to come—

16:15 Teach them that <389 cometh <42 <42 the Lord, who is
the very Eternal Father. Amen.

Mosiah Chapter 17

17:1 And now it came to pass that when Abinadi had finished these
sayings, that the king <114 that the priests <352 take him and
cause that he <8 be put to <287

17:2 But <298 was one among them whose name was Alma, he also <164 a
descendant of Nephi. And he was a young man, and he believed the words
<103 <61 had spoken, for he knew concerning the iniquity <10
<11 has testified against <185 <397 he began to plead with
the king that he <186 not be angry with Abinadi, but suffer that he
might <211 in peace.

17:3 But the king was more wroth, and caused that Alma <96 be cast
out from <89 <253 and sent his servants after him that they <34
slay him.

17:4 But he fled from <381 them and hid himself that they found him
not. And he <116 concealed for many days did write all the <109 <98
<98 had spoken.

17:5 And it came to pass that the king <71 that his guards <72
surround <22 and take him; and they bound him and cast him into
prison.

17:6 And <82 three days, <367 counseled with his priests, he <35
that he <35 again be <466 <83 him.

17:7 And he said unto him: <146 we have <90 an accusation <170
thee, and thou art worthy of <228

17:8 For thou hast said that God <115 <41 come down <145 the
children of men; and now, for this <260 thou shalt be put to death
unless thou wilt recall all the <125 <125 thou hast spoken evil
<232 me and my people.

17:9 Now <117 said unto him: I say unto you, I will not <31 the
<31 <31 I have <31 unto you <31 this people, for they are
true; and that ye may know of <463 surety I have suffered myself that
I have fallen into your hands.

17:10 Yea, and I will <271 even until death, and I will not <54 my
words, and they shall stand as a testimony <140 you. And if ye slay
me ye will shed innocent blood, and this <20 also <21 as a
<22 <22 you at the last day.

17:11 And now king Noah was about to release him, for he feared his
word; for he <6 that the judgments of God <352 come upon him.

17:12 But the <438 lifted up <109 voices <48 him, and <379 to
accuse him, saying: He has reviled the king. Therefore the king was
stirred up in anger <23 him, and he delivered him up that he <354
be slain.

17:13 And it came to pass that they took him and <307 him, and
scourged his skin with faggots, yea, even unto <264

17:14 And now when the flames <69 to scorch him, he cried unto <410
<73

17:15 Behold, even as ye have done unto me, so <150 it come to pass
that thy seed <9 <282 that many <4 <198 the pains that I do
suffer, even the <8 of <292 by fire; and this because they believe
in the salvation of the Lord <138 God.

17:16 And it will come to pass that ye <42 be afflicted with all
manner of diseases <33 of your iniquities.

17:17 Yea, and ye <20 be smitten on every hand, and <7 be driven
and scattered to and fro, even as a wild flock is <13 by wild and
ferocious beasts.

17:18 And in that day ye <31 be hunted, and ye <5 be taken by the
hand of your enemies, and then ye <13 <111 as I <3 the <113
of <114 by fire.

17:19 Thus God executeth vengeance upon those that destroy his <403
O God, receive my soul.

17:20 And now, when <411 had said these <347 he fell, having
<381 <40 by <154 yea, <7 been put to <8 <125 he <301
not deny the commandments of God, <15 sealed the truth of his <432
by his <242

Mosiah Chapter 18

18:1 And now, it came to pass that Alma, who had fled from the servants
of king Noah, repented of his sins and iniquities, and went <374
privately among the <469 and <276 to teach the <52 of Abinadi—

18:2 Yea, <485 that <493 was to come, and also <8 the
resurrection of the dead, and the redemption of the <34 <19 was
to be brought to pass through the power, and sufferings, and <112 of
Christ, and his <30 and ascension into heaven.

18:3 And as many as <128 hear his word he did teach. And he taught
them privately, that it <397 not come to the knowledge of the <424
And many did <314 his words.

18:4 And it came to pass that as many as did <17 him did go forth
to a place <87 was called Mormon, <178 received its name from the
king, being in the borders of the land <15 been infested, by times
or at seasons, by wild <300

18:5 Now, there was in Mormon a fountain of pure water, and Alma
resorted thither, <14 <39 near the water a thicket of small trees,
where he did hide himself in the daytime from the searches of the <105

18:6 And it came to pass that as many as believed him went thither to
hear his <120

18:7 And it came to pass after many days <59 were a goodly number
gathered together at the <120 of <118 to hear the <241 of Alma.
Yea, all were <17 <17 that <47 on his word, to hear him.
And he did <264 them, and did preach unto them repentance, and
redemption, and faith on the Lord.

18:8 And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the
waters of <144 (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are
desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be <204 his <296 and
are willing to bear one another’s burdens, that they may be light;

18:9 Yea, and are <18 to mourn with <455 that mourn; yea, and
comfort <7 that stand in need of comfort, and to <7 as witnesses
of God at all <235 and in all things, and in all places that ye may be
in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered
with <47 of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life—

18:10 Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what
have you against <270 baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness
before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will
serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit
more abundantly upon you?

18:11 And now when the people had heard these words, they clapped their
hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the <79 of our hearts.

18:12 And now it came to pass that Alma took Helam, he <89 one of the
first, and went and stood <425 in the <379 and cried, saying: O
<101 pour out thy <73 upon thy servant, that he may do this work
with holiness of heart.

18:13 And when he had said <80 <80 the <27 of the Lord was upon
him, and he said: <63 I baptize thee, <456 authority from the
Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have <150 into a <150 to
<146 him <222 you are dead as to the mortal body; and may the <48
of the Lord be poured out upon you; and may he grant unto you <227
life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has prepared from the
foundation of the world.

18:14 And <442 Alma had said <95 <95 both Alma and Helam were
buried in the water; and they arose and came <149 out of the water
rejoicing, <166 filled with the Spirit.

18:15 And again, Alma took another, and went <23 a second time into
the <176 and <279 him according to the <191 only he did not
bury himself again in the water.

18:16 And <75 this manner he did <155 every one that went <41 to
the place of Mormon; and they were in number about two hundred and four
souls; yea, and they were <55 in the <478 of Mormon, and were
<88 with the grace of God.

18:17 And they were <472 the church of God, or the <5 of <156
from that time forward. And it came to pass that whosoever was <45
by the power and <231 of God was added to his church.

18:18 And it came to pass that Alma, <251 <20 from God,
ordained priests; even one priest to <108 fifty of <359 <97 did he
ordain to preach unto them, and to teach them concerning the things
pertaining to the kingdom of God.

18:19 And he commanded them that they should <23 nothing save it were
the <26 which he had taught, and <5 had been spoken by the mouth
of the holy prophets.

18:20 Yea, even he <37 them that they <37 <65 <37 save
it were repentance and faith on the <394 who had redeemed his people.

18:21 And he <28 them that there <28 be no contention one with
<257 but that they <11 look forward with one eye, <130 one
<39 and one baptism, <7 <124 hearts knit together in unity and
in love one towards another.

18:22 And thus he <49 them to preach. And thus they became the
children of God.

18:23 And he <19 them that they <57 observe the sabbath day,
and keep it holy, and also <182 day they <15 give thanks to the
Lord <65 God.

18:24 And he also <35 them that the priests whom he had <215
<26 labor with <22 own hands for <4 support.

18:25 And <124 was one day in <48 week that was set apart that they
<28 gather themselves <112 to <206 the people, and to worship
the Lord <35 God, and also, as often as it was in <10 power, to
assemble <27 together.

18:26 And the <71 were not to depend upon the people for <22
support; but for <5 <79 they were to receive the <366 of God,
that they might wax strong in the Spirit, <183 the knowledge of God,
that they <14 <74 with <352 and <332 from God.

18:27 And <453 Alma <131 that the <52 of the <390 <100
impart of <53 substance, <115 one <481 to that <299 he had; if
he have more abundantly he <21 <20 more abundantly; and of him
that had but little, but little <14 be required; and to him that had
not <10 be given.

18:28 And thus they <10 <34 of <54 substance of <3 own free
will and good desires <270 God, and to those <137 that stood in
need, yea, and to <77 needy, naked soul.

18:29 And this he said unto <423 <127 been <106 of God; and
they did walk uprightly before God, imparting to one another both
temporally and spiritually <111 to <60 needs and <3 wants.

18:30 And now it came to pass that all this was done in Mormon, yea, by
the waters of <7 in the forest that was near the <10 of Mormon;
yea, the place of <16 the <10 of <4 the <19 of <4
how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who <299 came to the
<218 of <68 Redeemer; yea, and how blessed are they, for they
shall sing to his praise forever.

18:31 And these <509 were done in the borders of the land, that they
<249 not come to the <42 of the king.

18:32 But behold, it came to pass that the king, <152 discovered a
movement among the <349 sent his servants to watch them. Therefore
on the day that they were assembling <343 <370 to hear the
word of the Lord they were <34 unto the <52

18:33 And now the king said that Alma was stirring up the <307 to
rebellion against him; therefore he sent his army to destroy <54

18:34 And it came to pass that Alma and the <27 of the Lord were
apprised of the coming of the king’s army; <35 they took <155
tents and <4 families and departed into the wilderness.

18:35 And they were in number about four hundred and fifty souls.

Mosiah Chapter 19

19:1 And it came to pass that the army of the king returned, <146
searched in vain for the <72 of the Lord.

19:2 And now <171 the forces of the king were small, <25 been
reduced, and <240 began to be a division <177 the remainder of the
people.

19:3 And the lesser part <20 to breathe out threatenings <144 the
<206 and <31 <11 to be a great contention <32 <148

19:4 And now <15 was a man <12 them whose name was Gideon, and he
being a strong man and an enemy to the <39 <150 he drew his
sword, and swore in his wrath that he would slay the <223

19:5 And it came to pass that he fought with the king; and when the
king saw that he was <168 to overpower him, he fled and ran and got
upon the tower which was near the temple.

19:6 And Gideon pursued after him and was <30 to get upon the <22
to slay the <82 and the king cast his eyes round <18 towards the
land of Shemlon, and <179 the army of the Lamanites were within the
<381 of the land.

19:7 And now the king cried out in the anguish of his soul, saying:
<143 spare me, for the <32 are upon us, and they will <320
us; yea, they will <6 my <206

19:8 And now the king was not so much concerned <74 his <257 as he
was <7 his own life; nevertheless, <110 did <47 his life.

19:9 And the king commanded the <24 that they should flee before the
Lamanites, and he himself did go <9 them, and they did flee into
the wilderness, with <357 women and <3 children.

19:10 And it came to pass that the <96 did pursue <29 and did
overtake <5 and <277 to slay <273

19:11 Now it came to pass that the king <69 them that all the men
<71 leave <48 wives and <3 children, and flee <69 the
Lamanites.

19:12 Now <304 were many that <272 not <23 <50 but had rather
stay and perish with <54 And the rest left <34 <37 and <3
children and fled.

19:13 And it came to pass that those who tarried with <19 <22 and
<4 <22 caused that <4 fair daughters <72 stand forth and
plead with the <113 that they <61 not slay <52

19:14 And it came to pass that the <18 had compassion on <77
for they were charmed with the beauty of <43 women.

19:15 Therefore the <22 did <208 <11 lives, and took them
captives and carried them back to the land of Nephi, and granted unto
them that they might possess the land, under the conditions that they
<73 deliver up king Noah into the hands of the <232 and <11
up <48 property, even one half of all they possessed, one half of
<13 gold, and <3 silver, and all <4 precious things, and thus
they <126 pay tribute to the king of the <86 from year to year.

19:16 And now <199 was one of the sons of the king <508 <170 that
were taken captive, whose name was Limhi.

19:17 And now Limhi was desirous that his father <51 not be
destroyed; <343 <12 was not ignorant of the iniquities of
his father, he <330 being a just man.

19:18 And it came to pass that <370 sent men into the wilderness
secretly, to search for the king and <69 that were with him. And it
came to pass that they met the <385 in the <365 all save the
king and his priests.

19:19 Now they had sworn in <141 hearts that they <180 return to the
land of <205 and if <14 <285 and <3 <284 were slain, and
also <60 that had <300 with <259 that they <28 seek revenge,
and also <338 with <286

19:20 And the king <387 them that they <135 not return; and they
were angry with the king, and <329 that he <15 suffer, even unto
death by fire.

19:21 And they were <507 to take the priests also and put them to
death, and they fled <420 <58

19:22 And it came to pass that they were <29 to <108 to the land of
<108 and they met the men of Gideon. And the men of <181 told them
of all that had happened to <124 <127 and <3 children; and that
the <276 had <344 unto them that they <343 <343 the land by
paying a <297 to the <18 of one half of all they possessed.

19:23 And the <203 told the men of <56 that they had slain the
<132 and his <111 had fled from them farther into the wilderness.

19:24 And it came to pass that after they had ended the ceremony, that
they returned to the land of <111 rejoicing, because <89 <92 and
<4 <220 were not slain; and they told <58 what they had done
to the king.

19:25 And it came to pass that the king of the <100 made an oath
unto <245 that his <95 <211 not slay <183

19:26 And also Limhi, <353 the son of the <100 having the kingdom
conferred upon him by the people, made oath unto the king of the
<45 that his <39 <39 pay <154 unto him, even one half of
all they <154

19:27 And it came to pass that <417 began to establish the <48 and
to <6 peace <457 his people.

19:28 And the king of the <50 set guards round <256 the land,
that he <216 keep the <60 of <38 in the <12 that they <11 not
depart into the wilderness; and he did support his <31 out of the
<82 which he did receive from the Nephites.

19:29 And now king <38 did have continual <70 in his <78 for
the space of two years, that the <70 did not molest them nor seek
to destroy <162

Mosiah Chapter 20

20:1 Now there was a place in Shemlon where the daughters of the
<34 did gather themselves together to sing, and to dance, and to
make <11 merry.

20:2 And it came to pass that <38 was one day a small number of them
gathered <33 to sing and to dance.

20:3 And now the <320 of king Noah, <232 ashamed to <411 to the
city of <300 yea, and also fearing that the <161 <506 slay <266
therefore they durst not <22 to <311 <315 and <3 children.

20:4 And <263 tarried in the wilderness, and <6 discovered the
<105 of the Lamanites, they laid and watched them;

20:5 And when <90 were but few of them <86 <86 to <116
they came forth out of <48 secret places and took them and carried
them into the <221 yea, twenty and four of the <50 of the
<155 they <18 into the <422

20:6 And it came to pass that when the <18 found that <44
<27 had been missing, they were angry with the <117 of <368
for they thought it was the <10 of Limhi.

20:7 Therefore they sent <31 armies forth; yea, even the king himself
went before his people; and they went up to the land of Nephi to
<256 the <36 of <36

20:8 And now <293 had <146 them from the tower, even all <44
preparations for war did he discover; <184 he <139 his <30
together, and laid wait for them in the fields and in the forests.

20:9 And it came to pass that when the <117 had come up, that the
<34 of <57 <426 to fall upon them from <55 waiting places, and
<11 to slay <338

20:10 And it came to pass that the battle became exceedingly sore, for
they fought like lions for <31 prey.

20:11 And it came to pass that the <53 of <53 <42 to drive the
<68 <142 <251 yet they were not half so numerous as the
Lamanites. But they <41 for <39 lives, and for <4 wives, and
for <5 children; <128 they exerted <376 and like dragons
did they fight.

20:12 And it came to pass that they <235 the king of the <56
among the <386 of <35 dead; yet he was not dead, <330 been
wounded and left upon the ground, so speedy was the flight of his
people.

20:13 And they took him and bound up his wounds, and brought him <102
<274 and said: Behold, here is the king of the Lamanites; he <48
received a wound has fallen <66 <63 <58 and they have left him;
and behold, we have <36 him <36 you; and now let us slay him.

20:14 But <158 said unto them: Ye shall not slay him, but bring him
hither that I may see him. And they <36 him. And <24 said unto
him: What cause have ye to come up to war against my people? <85 my
<204 have not broken the oath that I made unto you; therefore, why
should ye break the oath which ye made unto my <28

20:15 And now the king <122 I have <33 the oath because thy <41
did carry away the <423 of my <385 <40 in my anger I did
<72 my <19 to come up to war <72 thy <178

20:16 And now <95 had heard nothing concerning this matter; <249
he <52 I will search <161 my <31 and whosoever has done this
thing <138 perish. <451 he caused a <17 to be made <20 his
<44

20:17 Now when Gideon had <44 these things, he being the king’s
captain, he went forth and said unto the king: I pray thee forbear, and
do not <41 this people, and lay not this <55 to <226 charge.

20:18 For do ye not remember the priests of thy father, whom this
<83 sought to destroy? And are they not in the wilderness? And are
not they the ones who have stolen the <149 of the Lamanites?

20:19 And now, <268 and tell the king of <90 <90 that he may
tell his <46 that they may be pacified towards us; for behold they
are already preparing to come <171 us; and <11 also there are but
few of us.

20:20 And <48 they come with <103 <446 hosts; and except the
king doth pacify them <43 us we must <173

20:21 For are not the words of Abinadi fulfilled, <267 he prophesied
<53 us—and all this <255 we would not hearken unto the <19 of
the Lord, and turn from our iniquities?

20:22 And now let us <52 the king, and we fulfil the oath <41 we
have made unto him; for it is better that we <326 be in bondage than
that we <8 lose our lives; <301 let us put a stop to the
shedding of so much blood.

20:23 And now <297 told the king all the things <300 his <211
and the <218 that had fled into the wilderness, and attributed the
carrying away of <141 <204 to them.

20:24 And it came to pass that the king was <191 <148 his
<370 and he said unto <466 Let us go <297 to meet my <285
without arms; and I swear unto you with an oath that my <227 <349
not slay thy <341

20:25 And it came to pass that they followed the <146 and went <41
<37 arms to meet the Lamanites. And it came to pass that they did
meet the Lamanites; and the king of the Lamanites did bow himself down
before them, and did plead in behalf of the <63 of Limhi.

20:26 And when the <25 saw the <13 of Limhi, that they were
<58 arms, they had compassion on them and were <123 <123
<40 and returned with <147 king in peace to <5 own land.

Mosiah Chapter 21

21:1 And it came to pass that <198 and his <50 <30 to the city
of Nephi, and began to dwell in the land again in peace.

21:2 And it came to pass that after many days the <85 <24 <19
to be stirred up in anger <325 the Nephites, and they <14 to come
into the borders of the land round about.

21:3 Now they durst not slay <99 <348 of the oath <319 <96 king
had made unto Limhi; but they <360 smite them on <13 cheeks, and
exercise authority over them; and <49 to put heavy burdens upon <15
backs, and drive them as they <27 a dumb ass—

21:4 Yea, all this was done that the word of the Lord might be
fulfilled.

21:5 And now the afflictions of the Nephites were great, and <478 was
no way that they could deliver themselves out of <57 hands, for the
<132 had surrounded them on every side.

21:6 And it came to pass that the <182 <87 to murmur with the king
<121 of <33 afflictions; and they <13 to be desirous to go
<161 them to battle. And they did afflict the king sorely with <23
complaints; therefore he granted unto them that they <450 do
according to <15 desires.

21:7 And they gathered <83 together again, and put on <15
armor, and went <353 <48 the <89 to <149 them out of <14
<281

21:8 And it came to pass that the <20 did beat <208 and drove
them back, and slew many of <457

21:9 And now <146 was a great mourning and lamentation among the
<121 of <353 the widow <11 for her husband, the son and the
daughter <10 for <61 father, and the brothers for <6
brethren.

21:10 Now <41 were a <41 many widows in the land, and they did cry
mightily from day to day, for a <18 fear of the <86 had come
upon <78

21:11 And it came to pass that <49 continual cries did stir up the
remainder of the <83 of <391 to <349 <140 the <477 and
they went <364 to battle, but they were driven back <165 suffering
much loss.

21:12 Yea, they went <20 even the third time, and suffered in the
like manner; and those that were not slain <435 <19 to the city
of Nephi.

21:13 And they did humble <213 even to the dust, subjecting
<7 to the yoke of bondage, submitting <7 to be smitten,
and to be <70 to and fro, and burdened, <252 to the desires of
<111 enemies.

21:14 And they did <44 <30 even in the depths of humility;
and they did cry <160 to God; yea, even all the day long did they
cry unto <36 God that he <416 <372 them out of <9 afflictions.

21:15 And now the Lord was slow to hear <14 cry <357 of <4
iniquities; nevertheless the Lord did hear <8 cries, and <364 to
soften the hearts of the <209 that they <11 to ease <17
burdens; yet the Lord did not see fit to <58 them out of bondage.

21:16 And it came to pass that they <30 to prosper by degrees in the
<267 and <10 to raise grain more abundantly, and flocks, and herds,
that they did not suffer with hunger.

21:17 Now <300 was a <282 number of women, more than <9 was of
men; <430 king <262 commanded that <484 man <430 impart to the
support of the <324 and <91 children, that they might not perish
with hunger; and this they did <132 of the greatness of <19 <47
that had been slain.

21:18 Now the <311 of <49 kept <461 in a body as much as it was
possible, and secured <30 <101 and <3 flocks;

21:19 And the king himself did not trust his person without the walls
of the city, unless he took his guards with him, fearing that he <80
by some means fall into the hands of the Lamanites.

21:20 And he caused that his <73 <116 watch the land round about,
that by some <28 they <34 take <354 priests that fled into the
wilderness, who had stolen the daughters of the Lamanites, and that had
<38 such a <171 destruction to come upon <449

21:21 For they were desirous to take them that they <44 punish them;
for they had come into the land of Nephi by night, and carried off
<129 <132 and many of <5 precious things; <206 they laid wait
for <47

21:22 And it came to pass that <228 was no more disturbance between
the <311 and the <112 of Limhi, even until the time that Ammon
and his brethren came into the land.

21:23 And the king having been <176 the gates of the city with his
guard, discovered <29 and his brethren; and supposing them to be
<143 of Noah <78 he <129 that they <166 be taken, and
bound, and cast into prison. And had they been the <23 of Noah he
<431 have <25 that they <25 be put to death.

21:24 But when he found that they were not, but that they were his
brethren, and had come from the land of Zarahemla, he was filled with
exceedingly <192 joy.

21:25 Now king <309 had sent, previous to the coming of Ammon, a small
<335 of men to search for the land of Zarahemla; but they could not
find it, and they were lost in the wilderness.

21:26 Nevertheless, they did find a land which had been peopled; yea, a
land <8 was covered with dry bones; yea, a land <9 had been
peopled and <6 had been destroyed; and they, <177 supposed it to
be the land of <99 returned to the land of Nephi, <16 arrived
in the borders of the land not many days before the <99 of Ammon.

21:27 And they brought a record with them, even a <5 of the <250
whose bones they had found; and it was engraven on plates of ore.

21:28 And now <145 was again <160 with joy in learning from the
mouth of <247 that king Mosiah had a gift from God, whereby he <145
interpret such engravings; yea, and <18 also did rejoice.

21:29 Yet <9 and his <302 were <42 with sorrow because so
many of <355 <11 had been slain;

21:30 And also that king Noah and his <270 had <265 the <94 to
commit so many sins and iniquities against God; and they also did mourn
for the death of Abinadi; and also for the departure of Alma and the
<32 that went with him, who had formed a church of God through the
strength and power of God, and faith on the words <206 had been spoken
by Abinadi.

21:31 Yea, they did <56 for <93 departure, for they knew not
whither they had fled. Now they <355 have gladly joined with <191 for
they themselves had entered into a covenant with God to serve him and
keep his commandments.

21:32 And now since the <232 of <331 king <196 had also <29
into a <30 with God, and also many of his people, to <36 him and
keep his <36

21:33 And it came to pass that king <35 and many of his <131 were
desirous to be baptized; but there was none in the land that had
authority from God. And <217 declined doing this thing, considering
himself an unworthy servant.

21:34 Therefore they did not at that time form <112 into a
church, waiting upon the Spirit of the Lord. Now they were <56 to
become even as Alma and his <472 who had fled into the <420

21:35 They were <22 to be baptized as a witness and a testimony
that they were willing to <120 God with all <191 hearts; nevertheless
they did prolong the time; and an account of <13 baptism shall be
given hereafter.

21:36 And now all the study of <110 and his <159 and king <142 and
his <7 was to deliver <101 out of the hands of the Lamanites
and from bondage.

<380 Chapter 22

22:1 And now it came to pass that <43 and king <40 began to consult
with the <184 how they should <44 <44 out of bondage; and
even they did cause that all the <18 <16 gather <16
together; and this they did that they might have the voice of the
<19 concerning the matter.

22:2 And it came to pass that they <448 find no way to <53
<38 out of bondage, except it were to take <138 women and
children, and <6 flocks, and <3 herds, and <3 tents, and
depart into the wilderness; for the <122 being so numerous, it was
impossible for the <63 of <109 to contend with <362 thinking to
<53 <52 out of bondage by the sword.

22:3 Now it came to pass that Gideon went forth and stood before the
king, and said unto him: Now O <7 thou hast hitherto hearkened unto
my <442 many times when we have been contending with our <277 the
Lamanites.

22:4 And now O <29 if thou hast not found me to be an unprofitable
servant, or if thou hast <43 listened to my <42 in any degree,
and they have been of service to thee, even so I desire that thou
wouldst listen to my <24 at this time, and I will be thy servant and
<119 this <131 out of <262

22:5 And the king granted unto him that he <217 speak. And <122 said
unto him:

22:6 Behold the back pass, through the back wall, on the back side of
the city. The Lamanites, or the guards of the <6 by night are
drunken; therefore let us send a proclamation among all this <66
that they <281 together <223 flocks and <228 that they may drive
them into the wilderness by night.

22:7 And I will go according to thy command and pay the last tribute of
wine to the <58 and they will be <58 and we will pass
<88 the secret pass on the left of <56 camp when they are drunken
and asleep.

22:8 Thus we will <291 with our <309 and our <309 our <308
and our herds into the <303 and we will travel around the land
of Shilom.

22:9 And it came to pass that the king <266 unto the <199 of
Gideon.

22:10 And king <324 caused that his <133 <412 <131 <74 <130
<413 and he sent the <107 of wine to the Lamanites; and he also
sent more wine, as a present unto them; and they did drink freely of
the wine which king <44 did send unto them.

22:11 And it came to pass that the <56 of king <19 did <116 by
<210 into the <182 with <66 <66 and <3 <197 and they
went round about the land of Shilom in the wilderness, and bent <17
course towards the land of Zarahemla, <436 led by Ammon and his
brethren.

22:12 And they had taken all <25 gold, and silver, and <5 precious
things, <85 they <503 carry, and also <10 provisions with <456
into the <176 and they pursued <11 journey.

22:13 And after <51 many days in the <86 they arrived in the
land of <65 and joined Mosiah’s people, and became his subjects.

22:14 And it came to pass that Mosiah received them with joy; and he
also <8 <50 records, and also the records <73 had been <452
by the <147 of Limhi.

22:15 And now it came to pass when the Lamanites had <21 that the
<21 of <167 had departed out of the land by night, that they sent
an army into the <90 to pursue <218

22:16 And <105 they had <116 them two days, they <135 no longer
follow <75 tracks; <409 they were lost in the wilderness.

<97 Chapter 23

23:1 Now Alma, having been warned of the Lord that the armies of king
Noah would come upon <170 and <18 made it known to his <145
<45 they gathered <443 <51 <364 and took of <5 grain,
and <97 into the <85 before the <37 of king Noah.

23:2 And the Lord did strengthen <42 that the <123 of king Noah
<92 not overtake them to destroy <314

23:3 And they fled eight days’ journey into the <98

23:4 And they came to a land, yea, even a very beautiful and pleasant
<9 a land of pure water.

23:5 And they pitched <82 tents, and began to till the ground, and
<7 to build buildings; yea, they were industrious, and did labor
exceedingly.

23:6 And the <85 were desirous that Alma <436 be <36 king, for
he was beloved by his people.

23:7 But he said unto them: Behold, it is not expedient that we <28
have a king; for thus saith the Lord: Ye shall not esteem one flesh
above another, or one man <11 not think himself <9 another;
<182 I say unto you it is not <40 that ye <40 have a
king.

23:8 Nevertheless, if it were possible that ye <169 always have just
men to be your kings it <233 be well for you to have a <31

23:9 But remember the iniquity of king Noah and his priests; and I
myself was caught in a snare, and did many things <372 were abominable
in the sight of the Lord, <10 caused me sore repentance;

23:10 <73 <336 much tribulation, the Lord did hear my cries,
and did answer my prayers, and has made me an instrument in his hands
in bringing so many of you to a knowledge of his truth.

23:11 <42 in this I do not glory, for I am unworthy to glory
of myself.

23:12 And now I say unto you, ye have been oppressed by king Noah, and
have been in bondage to him and his priests, and have been brought into
<131 by <435 <188 ye were bound with the bands of iniquity.

23:13 And now as ye have been delivered by the power of God out of
these bonds; yea, even out of the <106 of king Noah and his <413
and also from the bonds of iniquity, even so I desire that ye <233
stand fast in this liberty wherewith ye have been made free, and that
ye trust no man to be a king over you.

23:14 And also <15 no one to be your teacher nor your minister,
except he be a man of God, walking in his ways and keeping his
commandments.

23:15 Thus did Alma teach his <83 that every man <72 love his
neighbor as himself, that there <9 be no contention among <466

23:16 And now, Alma was <394 high priest, he being the founder of
<9 church.

23:17 And it came to pass that none received authority to preach or to
<58 <82 it were by him from God. Therefore he consecrated all
<33 priests and all <4 teachers; and none were <12 <22
they were just men.

23:18 <25 they did watch over <21 <95 and did nourish them
with <341 pertaining to righteousness.

23:19 And it came to pass that they <510 to prosper exceedingly in the
land; and they called the land Helam.

23:20 And it came to pass that they did multiply and <26
<27 in the land of Helam; and they built a city, <386 they
<34 the city of <35

23:21 Nevertheless the Lord seeth fit to chasten his people; yea, he
trieth <89 patience and <3 faith.

23:22 Nevertheless—whosoever putteth his <231 in him the same shall be
lifted up at the last day. Yea, and thus it was with this people.

23:23 For behold, I will show unto you that they were <361 into
bondage, and none could deliver them but the Lord <57 God, yea, even
the God of Abraham and Isaac and of Jacob.

23:24 And it came to pass that he did <31 them, and he did show
forth his mighty <381 unto <11 and great were <42 rejoicings.

23:25 For <70 it came to pass that while they were in the land of
Helam, yea, in the city of <6 <15 tilling the land round about,
behold an army of the Lamanites was in the borders of the land.

23:26 Now it came to pass that the brethren of Alma fled from <64
fields, and gathered themselves together in the city of <208 and they
were much frightened because of the appearance of the Lamanites.

23:27 But Alma went <105 and stood <367 <104 and exhorted them that
they <379 not be frightened, but that they <7 remember the Lord
<55 God and he would <140 <392

23:28 <326 they hushed <14 fears, and <304 to cry unto the Lord
that he <22 soften the hearts of the Lamanites, that they <9 spare
<57 and <26 wives, and <3 children.

23:29 And it came to pass the the Lord did <31 the <31 of the
<95 And Alma and his <129 went <94 and delivered
<125 up into <35 hands; and the <161 took possession of
the land of <329

23:30 Now the armies of the <68 <347 had followed after the
people of king Limhi, had been lost in the wilderness for many days.

23:31 And <237 they had found those <464 of king Noah, in a place
<37 they <383 Amulon; and they had begun to possess the land of
Amulon and had <10 to till the ground.

23:32 Now the name of the leader of <42 <42 was Amulon.

23:33 And it came to pass that <33 did plead with the Lamanites; and
he also sent <125 <119 <157 who were the daughters of the
<106 to <21 with <13 brethren, that they <219 not destroy
<8 husbands.

23:34 And the <144 had compassion on <45 and his <22 and
did not <22 <201 <277 of <24 wives.

23:35 And <19 and his <183 did join the <50 and they were
traveling in the <148 in search of the land of Nephi when they
discovered the land of <371 <142 was possessed by Alma and his
brethren.

23:36 And it came to pass that the <74 promised unto Alma and his
<74 that if they <276 show them the way <36 led to the land of
<52 that they <15 grant unto them <88 lives and <3 liberty.

23:37 But <236 Alma had shown them the way that led to the land of
<31 the <56 <31 not keep <27 promise; but they set guards
<454 about the land of <93 over Alma and his <89

23:38 And the remainder of them went to the land of Nephi; and a part
of them returned to the land of <32 and also brought with them the
wives and the children of the <53 who had been left in the <497

23:39 And the king of the <79 had granted unto <190 that he
<229 be a king and a ruler over his people, who were in the land of
<504 nevertheless he <20 have no power to do anything contrary to
the will of the king of the <416

Mosiah Chapter 24

24:1 And it came to pass that <58 did gain favor in the eyes of the
king of the <320 therefore, the king of the <81 <80
unto him and his <271 that they <63 be appointed teachers over
his <81 yea, even over the <431 who were in the land of Shemlon,
and in the land of Shilom, and in the land of <384

24:2 For the <49 had taken <484 of all these lands;
<63 the king of the <14 had <53 kings over all <14
lands.

24:3 And now the name of the king of the <22 was Laman, being
<466 <267 the name of his father; and therefore he was <11 king
Laman. And he was king over a numerous people.

24:4 And he <54 <107 of the <116 of <144 in every land
<330 was <366 by his people; and thus the language of <303 began
to be taught among all the <128 of the <189

24:5 And they were a <12 friendly one with another; <222
they knew not God; neither did the <53 of <53 teach them
<229 concerning the Lord <342 God, <15 the law of Moses; nor
did they <18 them the words of Abinadi;

24:6 But they <63 them that they <203 keep <29 record, and that
they might write one to another.

24:7 And thus the <148 <92 to increase in riches, and <6 to
trade one with another and wax great, and <11 to be a cunning and a
wise <243 as to the wisdom of the world, yea, a very <16 <12
delighting in all manner of wickedness and plunder, except it were
<139 <72 own <428

24:8 And now it came to pass that <123 <51 to exercise authority
over Alma and his brethren, and <11 to persecute him, and cause that
his <423 <110 <9 <38 children.

24:9 For <31 knew Alma, that he had been one of the king’s priests,
and that it was he that believed the <153 of Abinadi and was driven
out before the king, and <267 he was wroth with him; for he was
subject to king <291 yet he exercised <77 over them, and put
tasks upon <6 and put task-masters over them.

24:10 And it came to pass that so great were <84 afflictions that
they <101 to cry mightily to God.

24:11 And <93 commanded them that they <107 stop <23 cries; and
he put guards over them to watch <53 that whosoever <16 be found
calling upon God <7 be put to death.

24:12 And Alma and his <304 did not raise <38 voices to the Lord
<6 God, but did pour out <6 hearts to him; and he did know the
thoughts of <12 hearts.

24:13 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in
<22 afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good comfort,
for I know of the covenant <405 ye have made unto me; and I will
<11 with my <82 and deliver them out of bondage.

24:14 And I will also ease the burdens <31 are put upon your
shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while
you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses
for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord
God, do visit my <73 in <107 afflictions.

24:15 And now it came to pass that the <72 <72 were laid upon
Alma and his <470 were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen
them that they could bear up <39 <26 with ease, and they did
submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.

24:16 And it came to pass that so <286 was <33 faith and <3
<26 that the <196 of the Lord came unto them again, <193 Be of
good <189 for on the morrow I will <173 you out of <173

24:17 And he said unto Alma: Thou shalt go <379 this <470 and I
will go with thee and <28 this <132 out of <29

24:18 Now it came to pass that Alma and his <17 in the night-time
gathered <78 flocks together, and also of <6 grain; yea, even all
the <16 were they gathering the <17 together.

24:19 And in the morning the Lord caused a deep sleep to come upon the
Lamanites, yea, and all <37 <427 were in a profound sleep.

24:20 And Alma and his <64 departed into the wilderness; and when
they had traveled all day they pitched <30 tents in a valley, and
they called the valley Alma, because he led <15 way in the
wilderness.

24:21 Yea, and in the <19 of Alma they poured out <20 thanks to
God <28 he had been merciful unto <452 and eased <14 burdens,
and had delivered them out of <319 for they were in bondage, and
none <257 <166 them except it were the Lord <26 God.

24:22 And they gave <48 to God, yea, all <14 men and all <4
women and all <5 children that <34 speak lifted <6 <483 in
the praises of <7 God.

24:23 And now the Lord said unto <236 Haste thee and get thou and this
<147 out of this land, for the Lamanites have awakened and do pursue
thee; therefore get thee out of this <17 and I will stop the
<21 in this <134 that they come no further in pursuit of this
people.

24:24 And it came to pass that they <200 out of the <186 and
took <83 journey into the <178

24:25 And after they had been in the wilderness twelve days they
arrived in the land of Zarahemla; and king Mosiah did also receive them
with joy.

<11 Chapter 25

25:1 And now king <10 <288 that all the <117 should be <326
<308

25:2 Now there were not so many of the <168 of Nephi, or so many of
those who were descendants of <11 as <22 were of the <37 of
Zarahemla, who was a descendant of Mulek, and <22 who came with him
into the <107

25:3 And <29 were not so many of the <32 of Nephi and of the
<7 of Zarahemla as <18 were of the Lamanites; yea, they were not
half so numerous.

25:4 And now all the <25 of <32 were assembled <426 and also
all the <11 of <74 and they were <115 together in two
bodies.

25:5 And it came to pass that <139 did read, and <142 to be <5
the records of Zeniff to his people; yea, he read the <10 of the
<46 of Zeniff, from the time they left the land of <91 until
they returned again.

25:6 And he also read the account of Alma and his brethren, and all
<248 afflictions, from the time they left the land of <34 <34
the time they <36 <36

25:7 And now, when <84 had made an end of reading the records, his
<71 who tarried in the land were struck with wonder and amazement.

25:8 For they knew not what to think; for when they beheld <208 that
had been <456 out of bondage they were filled with exceedingly
great joy.

25:9 And again, when they thought of <90 brethren who had been slain
by the <381 they were <28 with sorrow, and even shed many tears
of sorrow.

25:10 And <33 when they <33 of the immediate goodness of God,
and his power in delivering Alma and his <46 out of the hands of
the <46 and of bondage, they did raise <62 <490 and give
thanks to God.

25:11 And <47 when they <47 upon the Lamanites, who were <22
<180 of <4 sinful and polluted state, they were <83 with
pain and anguish for the welfare of <17 souls.

25:12 And it came to pass that <144 who were the <386 of Amulon
and his <41 who had taken to wife the daughters of the <56
were displeased with the conduct of <40 fathers, and they would no
longer be called by the names of <14 <14 therefore they took
upon themselves the name of <422 that they might be <21 the
<57 of <360 and be numbered among <68 who were <13 Nephites.

25:13 And now all the <252 of <280 were <19 with the
Nephites, and this because the kingdom had been conferred upon none but
<34 who were <476 of Nephi.

25:14 And now it came to pass that when <302 had made an end of
speaking and <305 to the people, he desired that Alma should also
speak to the people.

25:15 And Alma did <11 unto them, when they were <452 <439
in large bodies, and he went from one body to another, preaching unto
the <94 repentance and faith on the Lord.

25:16 And he did exhort the <16 of Limhi and his <186 all <96
that had been <342 out of <265 that they <72 remember that
it was the Lord that did deliver them.

25:17 And it came to pass that after Alma had taught the <45 many
things, and had made an end of <119 to <95 that king <58 was
desirous that he <201 be baptized; and all his <27 were <11
that they <12 be baptized also.

25:18 Therefore, Alma did go forth into the water and did baptize them;
yea, he did <6 them <64 the manner he did his <371 in the
waters of Mormon; yea, and as many as he did <22 did belong to the
church of God; and this <234 of <286 belief on the words of Alma.

25:19 And it came to pass that king <226 granted unto Alma that he
<84 establish churches throughout all the land of Zarahemla; and gave
him <442 to ordain priests and teachers over every church.

25:20 Now this was done <57 there were so many <125 that they
could not all be governed by one teacher; neither <9 they all hear
the word of God in one assembly;

25:21 Therefore they did assemble <372 <264 in different
<264 being <357 churches; <57 <110 having <105 <65 and
<4 teachers, and <10 priest <271 the word according as it was
<247 to him by the mouth of <123

25:22 And thus, notwithstanding <81 <39 many <113 they were all
one church, yea, even the <47 of God; for <17 was nothing preached
in all the <22 except it were <318 and <318 in God.

25:23 And now <23 were seven <18 in the land of Zarahemla. And
it came to pass that whosoever were <258 to take upon them the name
of Christ, or of God, they did join the <32 of God;

25:24 And they were <122 the <164 of God. And the Lord did pour out
his Spirit upon <317 and they were blessed, and prospered in the land.

<232 Chapter 26

26:1 Now it came to pass that <86 were many of the rising generation
that <199 not understand the <272 of king Benjamin, <142 little
children at the time he spake unto his people; and they did not believe
the tradition of <192 fathers.

26:2 They did not <14 what had been said concerning the
resurrection of the dead, <250 did they <15 <11 the
coming of Christ.

26:3 And now <283 of <39 unbelief they <71 not <71 the
word of God; and <12 hearts were hardened.

26:4 And they would not be <434 <44 <5 they join the
<326 And they were a separate <154 as to <29 faith, and remained
so ever after, even in <10 carnal and sinful state; for they <31
not call upon the Lord <14 God.

26:5 And now in the reign of <167 they were not half so numerous as
the <49 of God; but <93 of the dissensions among the <464
they became more numerous.

26:6 For it came to pass that they did deceive many with <53
flattering words, who were in the <320 and did cause them to commit
many sins; therefore it <38 expedient that those who committed sin,
that were in the <24 should be admonished by the <124

26:7 And it came to pass that they were brought before the priests, and
<393 up unto the <413 by the teachers; and the <6 <17
them <19 Alma, who was the high priest.

26:8 Now king <125 had given Alma the authority over the <54

26:9 And it came to pass that Alma did not know <239 them; but
<306 were many witnesses against <8 yea, the <150 stood and
testified of <125 iniquity in abundance.

26:10 Now <23 had not any such thing happened <70 in the church;
<128 Alma was troubled in his spirit, and he caused that they
<126 be <93 <21 the king.

26:11 And he said unto the king: Behold, here are many whom we have
<22 <22 thee, who are accused of <65 brethren; yea, and they
have been taken in divers iniquities. And they do not repent of <18
iniquities; <65 we have <31 them <32 <32 that thou
mayest judge them according to <18 crimes.

26:12 But king <150 said unto Alma: <63 I <18 them not;
<33 I deliver them into thy hands to be judged.

26:13 And now the spirit of Alma was again troubled; and he went and
inquired of the Lord what he <119 do <173 this matter, for he
feared that he <11 do wrong in the sight of God.

26:14 And it came to pass that after he had poured out his whole soul
to God, the voice of the Lord came to him, saying:

26:15 Blessed art thou, <262 and blessed are they who were baptized in
the waters of Mormon. Thou art <14 <378 of thy exceeding faith
in the words alone of my servant Abinadi.

26:16 And <20 are they <22 of <149 <22 <22 in the
<22 <22 which thou hast spoken unto them.

26:17 And <24 art thou <24 thou hast established a church <426
this people; and they shall be established, and they <5 be my
people.

26:18 Yea, <30 is this <308 who are willing to bear my name; for
in my name <26 they be called; and they are mine.

26:19 And <56 thou hast <184 of me <179 the transgressor,
thou art blessed.

26:20 Thou art my servant; and I covenant with thee that thou shalt
have eternal life; and thou <7 serve me and go forth in my name, and
<11 gather together my sheep.

26:21 And he that will hear my <195 <75 be my sheep; and him <6
ye receive into the <495 and him will I also receive.

26:22 For behold, this is my <399 whosoever is <205 <26 be
<4 unto repentance. And whomsoever ye <32 <10 believe in my
<128 and him will I freely forgive.

26:23 For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is
I that hath created <478 and it is I that granteth unto him that
believeth unto the end a place at my right hand.

26:24 For <81 in my name are they <183 and if they know me they
<77 come forth, and <4 have a <31 eternally at my <32 <32

26:25 And it <15 come to pass that when the second trump <9 sound
then <4 they that never knew me come <180 and <9 stand <461
me.

26:26 And then <11 they know that I am the Lord <319 God, that I am
<6 Redeemer; but they would not be redeemed.

26:27 And then I will confess unto them that I <52 knew <129 and
they <41 depart into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his
angels.

26:28 Therefore I say unto you, that he that will not hear my voice,
the same <33 ye not <207 into my <239 for him I will not
<10 at the last day.

26:29 <38 I say unto you, Go; and <245 transgresseth against
me, him <35 ye judge according to the sins <419 he has committed;
and if he <94 his sins <136 thee and me, and repenteth in the
sincerity of his heart, him <32 ye forgive, and I will forgive him
also.

26:30 Yea, and as often as my <420 repent will I <18 them <153
trespasses <65 me.

26:31 And ye <37 also <15 one another your trespasses; for verily
I say unto you, he that forgiveth not his neighbor’s <29 when he
says that he repents, the same hath brought himself under condemnation.

26:32 Now I say unto you, Go; and <121 will not <65 of his sins
the same <56 not be numbered among my people; and this <9 be
observed from this time forward.

26:33 And it came to pass when Alma had heard these words he wrote them
down that he might have them, and that he <6 <169 the <121 of
that church <175 to the commandments of God.

26:34 And it came to pass that Alma went and judged those that had been
taken in iniquity, <28 to the word of the Lord.

26:35 And <103 repented of <163 sins and did <210 <60 them
he did number <103 the <61 of the <489

26:36 And <45 that <336 not <22 <27 sins and <133 of <5
<50 the same were not <132 <29 the <29 of the <295
and <16 names were blotted out.

26:37 And it came to pass that Alma did regulate all the affairs of the
<56 and they began again to have peace and to prosper exceedingly
in the <19 of the <45 walking circumspectly <296 God,
receiving many, and baptizing many.

26:38 And now all <174 things did Alma and his fellow laborers do who
were over the <32 <32 in all diligence, teaching the word of
God in all things, suffering all manner of afflictions, being
persecuted by all <124 who did not belong to the <197 of God.

26:39 And they did admonish <116 brethren; and they were also
admonished, every one by the word of God, <194 to his sins, or to
the sins <402 he had committed, <51 commanded of God to pray without
ceasing, and to give thanks in all things.

Mosiah Chapter 27

27:1 And now it came to pass that the persecutions <39 were inflicted
on the <80 by the unbelievers became so great that the <9 <168
to murmur, and complain to <86 leaders concerning the matter; and
they did <11 to Alma. And Alma laid the case <174 <18 king,
Mosiah. And <62 consulted with his priests.

27:2 And it came to pass that king <16 sent a proclamation
throughout the land round about that there should not any unbeliever
persecute any of <163 who belonged to the <72 of God.

27:3 And <22 was a strict command <33 all the churches that
<11 <33 be no <111 <298 <334 that <8 <8 be an
equality <9 all men;

27:4 That they <14 let no pride nor haughtiness disturb <95 peace;
that <195 man <13 esteem his neighbor as himself, laboring with
<15 own hands for <4 support.

27:5 Yea, and all <9 priests and teachers <26 labor with <7
own <21 for <5 support, in all cases save it were in sickness, or
in much want; and doing <312 <286 they did abound in the grace of
God.

27:6 And <95 <194 to be much <362 <366 in the land; and the <406
<13 to be very numerous, and <6 to scatter abroad upon the face of
the earth, yea, on the north and on the south, on the east and on the
west, building large cities and villages in all quarters of the land.

27:7 And the Lord did visit them and <423 <167 and they <272 a
<28 and wealthy people.

27:8 Now the sons of <235 were <487 <180 the unbelievers; and
also one of the sons of Alma was <14 <14 <36 he <352 called
Alma, after his father; nevertheless, he <44 a very wicked and an
idolatrous man. And he was a man of many words, and did speak much
flattery to the people; therefore he led many of the <137 to do <40
the <453 of his iniquities.

27:9 And he <48 a <364 hinderment to the prosperity of the <296
of God; stealing away the hearts of the <42 causing much dissension
<84 the <7 giving a chance for the enemy of God to exercise his
power over them.

27:10 And now it came to pass that while he was going <360 to destroy
the <53 of God, for he did go <12 secretly with the sons of <152
seeking to <20 the church, and to lead astray the <103 of the
Lord, contrary to the commandments of God, or even the king—

27:11 And as I said unto you, as they were going about rebelling
against God, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto them; and he
descended as it were in a cloud; and he spake as it were with a voice
of thunder, which caused the earth to shake upon <7 they stood;

27:12 And so great was their astonishment, that they fell to the earth,
and understood not the words <25 he <44 unto them.

27:13 Nevertheless he cried again, saying: Alma, arise and stand forth,
for why persecutest thou the church of God? For the Lord hath said:
This is my church, and I will establish it; and nothing shall overthrow
it, save it is the transgression of my people.

27:14 And <50 the <125 <33 Behold, the Lord hath heard the
prayers of his people, and also the <7 of his servant, <70 who
is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that
thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore, for
this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of
God, that the <52 of his servants might be answered according to
<156 faith.

27:15 And now <213 can ye dispute the <31 of God? For <9 doth
not my <200 <192 the earth? And can ye not also behold me before you?
And I am sent from God.

27:16 Now I say unto thee: Go, and remember the captivity of thy
fathers in the land of Helam, and in the land of Nephi; and <19
how <233 things he has done for <278 for they were in bondage, and he
has delivered <230 And now I say unto thee, <157 go thy way, and seek
to destroy the <226 no more, that <113 <124 may be answered, and
this even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off.

27:17 And now it came to pass that these were the last <288 <288 the
<227 <290 unto <53 and he departed.

27:18 And now Alma and those that were with him fell again to the
<323 for <101 was <65 astonishment; for with <4 own eyes they
had beheld an <41 of the Lord; and his <174 was as <374 <54
shook the earth; and they knew that there was <309 save the <201 of
God that could <197 the <393 and cause it to tremble as though it
would part asunder.

27:19 And now the astonishment of Alma was so <71 that he became
dumb, that he <36 not open his mouth; yea, and he <13 weak, even
that he <14 not move his hands; therefore he was taken by <115 that
were with him, and carried helpless, even until he was laid <260 his
father.

27:20 And they rehearsed unto his father all that had happened unto
<232 and his <10 rejoiced, for he knew that it was the <111 of
God.

27:21 And he <508 that a multitude should be gathered together that
they <352 witness what the Lord had done for his son, and also for
<81 that were with him.

27:22 And he <36 that the priests <36 assemble themselves
together; and they began to fast, and to pray to the Lord <209 God
that he <164 open the mouth of <249 that he <58 speak, and also
that his limbs <8 receive <23 strength—that the eyes of the people
<10 be opened to see and know of the goodness and glory of God.

27:23 And it came to pass after they had fasted and <499 for the
space of two days and two nights, the <51 of Alma received <52
strength, and he stood up and <92 to speak unto them, bidding them to
be of good comfort:

27:24 For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed
of the <314 <477 I am born of the Spirit.

27:25 And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men
and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born
again; yea, born of God, changed from <86 carnal and fallen state, to
a state of righteousness, being <61 of God, becoming his sons and
daughters;

27:26 And thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they
can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.

27:27 I say unto you, <22 this be the case, they must be cast off;
and this I know, because I was like to be cast off.

27:28 Nevertheless, <189 wading through much tribulations, repenting
nigh unto death, the Lord in mercy hath seen fit to snatch me out of an
everlasting burning, and I am born of God.

27:29 My soul hath been <110 from the gall of bitterness and bonds
of iniquity. I was in the darkest abyss; but now I <186 the marvelous
light of God. My soul was racked with eternal torment; but I am
snatched, and my soul is pained no more.

27:30 I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that which had been spoken of
by our fathers; but now that they may foresee that he will come, and
that he remembereth every creature of his creating, he will make
himself manifest unto all.

27:31 Yea, <18 knee shall bow, and <5 tongue confess <488 him.
Yea, even at the last day, when all men <18 stand to be judged of
him, then <9 they <24 that he is God; then <8 they confess,
who live without God in the world, that the judgment of an <168
punishment is just upon them; and they <25 quake, and tremble, and
shrink beneath the glance of his all-searching eye.

27:32 And now it came to pass that Alma <387 from this time forward to
teach the <330 and <512 who were with Alma at the time the angel
appeared unto <407 traveling round about <253 all the land,
publishing to all the <478 the things <170 they had heard and seen,
and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, <354 greatly
persecuted by <50 who were unbelievers, <9 smitten by many of
them.

27:33 But notwithstanding all <353 they did impart much consolation to
the church, confirming <399 faith, and exhorting them with
long-suffering and much travail to keep the commandments of God.

27:34 And four of them were the sons of Mosiah; and <31 names were
Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni; these were the <13 of the
sons of Mosiah.

27:35 And they traveled throughout all the lands of Zarahemla, and
among all the <123 who were under the reign of king Mosiah, zealously
striving to repair all the injuries <137 they had done to the <95
confessing all <66 sins, and <157 all the <154 <17 they had
<153 and explaining the prophecies and the scriptures to all who
desired to hear <142

27:36 And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in bringing
many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, to the <7 of <56
Redeemer.

27:37 And how blessed are they! For they did publish peace; they did
<5 good tidings of good; and they did declare unto the <114 that
the Lord reigneth.

Mosiah Chapter 28

28:1 Now it came to pass that after the sons of <17 had done all
<173 things, they took a small number with them and returned to <74
father, the king, and <113 of him that he would grant unto them that
they might, with <32 whom they had selected, go up to the land of
Nephi that they might preach the <162 <162 they had heard, and that
they <12 <283 the word of God to <54 brethren, the Lamanites—

28:2 That perhaps they <18 bring them to the <146 of the Lord
<21 God, and convince them of the iniquity of <9 fathers; and that
<26 they <26 cure them of <11 hatred towards the Nephites, that
they <12 also be brought to rejoice in the Lord <17 God, that they
<14 become friendly to one another, and that there should be no more
contentions in all the land <97 the Lord <27 God had given <247

28:3 Now they were desirous that salvation <28 be declared to every
creature, for they could not bear that any human soul <16 perish;
yea, even the very thoughts that any soul <11 endure endless torment
did cause them to quake and tremble.

28:4 And thus did the Spirit of the Lord work upon <500 for they were
the very vilest of sinners. And the Lord saw fit in his infinite mercy
to spare them; nevertheless they suffered much anguish of soul because
of <101 iniquities, suffering much and fearing that they <67 be
cast off forever.

28:5 And it came to pass that they did plead with <28 father many
days that they <158 go up to the land of Nephi.

28:6 And king <306 went and inquired of the Lord if he <50 let his
sons go up <465 the Lamanites to <273 the word.

28:7 And the Lord said unto Mosiah: Let them go up, for many shall
believe on <64 words, and they <8 have eternal life; and I will
deliver thy sons out of the <442 of the Lamanites.

28:8 And it came to pass that <75 granted that they <93 go and do
according to <43 request.

28:9 And they took <9 journey into the wilderness to go up to <84
the word <92 the Lamanites; and I <66 give an account of <23
proceedings hereafter.

28:10 Now king <53 had no one to confer the kingdom upon, for <302
was not any of his sons who <425 accept of the kingdom.

28:11 Therefore he took the records <314 were engraven on the plates
of brass, and also the <7 of Nephi, and all the <430 <19 he had
kept and preserved <103 to the commandments of God, <503 having
translated and caused to be written the <43 <24 were on the
<36 of gold <8 had been found by the people of Limhi, <9 were
delivered to him by the hand of Limhi;

28:12 And this he did <292 of the great anxiety of his people; for
they were <390 beyond measure to know concerning those <41 who
had been destroyed.

28:13 And now he <76 them by the means of <20 two stones <60
were fastened into the two rims of a bow.

28:14 Now these <119 were prepared from the beginning, and were
handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of
interpreting languages;

28:15 And they have been kept and <144 by the hand of the Lord,
that he <331 discover to <474 creature who <6 possess the land
the iniquities and abominations of his <110

28:16 And whosoever has <68 <68 is called seer, <177 the manner
of old times.

28:17 Now <12 <255 had finished translating <22 records, behold,
it gave an <278 of the <138 who were destroyed, from the time that
they were destroyed back to the building of the <172 tower, at the
time the Lord confounded the language of the <31 and they were
scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth, yea, and even from
that time back until the creation of Adam.

28:18 Now this <67 did cause the <37 of <84 to mourn
exceedingly, yea, they were filled with sorrow; nevertheless it gave
them much knowledge, in the <206 they did rejoice.

28:19 And this <36 <385 be <299 hereafter; for <114 it is
expedient that all <45 <165 know the <148 <28 are <17 in
this account.

28:20 And now, as I said unto you, that <152 king <69 had done
<153 things, he took the <336 of <378 and all the <37 <37 he
had kept, and conferred them upon Alma, who was the son of Alma; yea,
all the <184 and also the interpreters, and <20 them upon
him, and commanded him that he <77 keep and preserve them, and also
keep a record of the people, handing them down from one <297 to
another, even as they had been <309 down from the time that Lehi left
Jerusalem.

<93 Chapter 29

29:1 Now when <9 had done this he sent out throughout all the land,
among all the <52 desiring to know their will <402 who <73
be <7 king.

29:2 And it came to pass that the voice of the <170 came, saying: We
are <434 that Aaron thy son <30 be our king and our ruler.

29:3 Now <15 had gone up to the land of Nephi, therefore the king
could not confer the kingdom upon him; neither would <22 take upon
him the kingdom; <9 were any of the sons of <101 willing to take
upon them the kingdom.

29:4 Therefore king <15 sent again <107 the <402 yea, even a
<247 word sent he <11 the people. And <232 were the words that
were written, <98

29:5 Behold, O ye my <136 or my brethren, for I esteem you as such,
I desire that ye <113 consider the <344 <256 ye are <443 to
consider—for ye are <131 to have a <156

29:6 Now I declare unto you that he to whom the <116 doth rightly
belong has declined, and will not take upon him the <103

29:7 And now if there <55 be another appointed in his stead, behold
I fear <12 <147 rise contentions <106 you. And who knoweth but what
my son, to whom the <51 doth belong, <31 turn to be angry and
draw away a part of this <223 <370 him, <98 <36 <101 wars and
<39 <39 you, <9 <9 be the <11 of shedding much blood
and perverting the way of the Lord, yea, and destroy the souls of many
<170

29:8 Now I say unto you let us be wise and <150 <184 <416 for
we have no right to <31 my son, <236 <79 we have any <10 to
<11 <116 if he <11 be <120 in his stead.

29:9 And if my son <14 turn <240 to his pride and vain <451 he
<89 recall the <6 <94 he had said, and claim his <43 to the
kingdom, <12 <17 <104 him and also this <125 to commit much sin.

29:10 And now let us be wise and look forward to <91 <91 and do
that <32 will make for the peace of this <121

29:11 <314 I will be your king the remainder of my days;
nevertheless, let us appoint judges, to judge this <58 according to
our law; and we will newly arrange the affairs of this <312 for we
will <25 wise men to be <29 that will <30 this <30
<31 to the commandments of God.

29:12 Now it is better that a man <141 be judged of God than of man,
for the judgments of God are always just, but the <8 of man are
not <10 just.

29:13 Therefore, if it were possible that you <457 have just men to be
your kings, who <161 establish the laws of God, and <76 this <76
<76 to his commandments, yea, if ye <28 have men for your kings
who <26 do even as my father Benjamin did for this people—I say unto
you, if this <25 <67 be the case then it <24 be expedient that
ye <104 <13 have <36 to rule over you.

29:14 And even I myself have labored with all the power and faculties
<211 I have possessed, to teach you the <151 of God, and to
<94 <221 throughout the land, that <414 <46 be no wars nor
contentions, no stealing, nor plundering, nor murdering, nor any manner
of iniquity;

29:15 And whosoever has committed iniquity, him have I punished
<124 to the crime <58 he has committed, <8 to the law
<9 has been given to us by our fathers.

29:16 Now I say unto you, that because all men are not just it is not
<125 that ye <78 have a king or <126 to rule over you.

29:17 For behold, how much iniquity doth one wicked king <363 to be
<65 yea, and what great destruction!

29:18 Yea, remember king Noah, his wickedness and his abominations, and
also the <8 and abominations of his <357 Behold what <27
destruction did come upon them; and also <80 of their iniquities
they were brought into bondage.

29:19 And were it not for the interposition of <20 all-wise Creator,
and this <28 of <8 sincere repentance, they must unavoidably
remain in bondage until now.

29:20 But <99 he did deliver them <24 they did humble
themselves before him; and <9 they cried mightily unto him he did
<20 them out of bondage; and thus doth the Lord work with his <253
in all cases among the children of men, extending the arm of mercy
towards them that put <73 trust in him.

29:21 And <65 now I say unto you, ye cannot dethrone an iniquitous
king save it be through much contention, and the shedding of much
blood.

29:22 For <31 he has his friends in <267 and he keepeth his
guards about him; and he teareth up the laws of those who have reigned
in righteousness <114 him; and he trampleth under his feet the
<340 of God;

29:23 And he enacteth laws, and sendeth them forth <109 his people,
yea, laws after the <335 of his own wickedness; and <332 doth
not obey his laws he causeth to be destroyed; and <13 doth rebel
against him he will send his armies <7 them to war, and if he can
he will destroy <250 and thus an unrighteous king doth pervert the
ways of all righteousness.

29:24 And now behold I say unto you, it is not <345 that such
<294 <347 come upon you.

29:25 Therefore, choose you by the voice of this <97 judges, that
ye may be judged <408 to the laws <407 have been <407 you by our
fathers, <9 are correct, and <4 were <12 them by the hand of
the Lord.

29:26 Now it is not common that the <50 of the people desireth
anything contrary to that <32 is right; but it is <19 for the
lesser part of the <21 to desire that <18 is not <19 therefore
this shall ye observe and make it your law—to do your business by the
<49 of the <407

29:27 And if the time comes that the <15 of the <43 doth <123
<265 then is the time that the judgments of God will come upon
you; yea, then is the time he will visit you with <448 <447
even as he has hitherto visited this land.

29:28 And now if ye have <162 and they do not judge you <162 to
the law <100 has been given, ye can cause that they may be <179 of a
higher judge.

29:29 If your <8 judges do not <34 righteous judgments, ye <124
<27 that a small number of your lower <17 <233 be gathered
together, and they <18 <23 your <29 <65 <59 to the
<122 of the <137

29:30 And I command you to do these things in the fear of the Lord; and
I <15 you to do <15 things, and that ye have no king; that if
<11 <160 commit sins and iniquities they <56 be answered upon
<478 own heads.

29:31 For <322 I say unto you, the sins of many <28 have been
caused by the <31 of <26 kings; <234 <3 <6 are
<36 upon the heads of <9 kings.

29:32 And now I <259 that this inequality <119 be no more in this
land, especially <444 this my people; but I <19 that this land be a
land of liberty, and every man may enjoy his rights and privileges
alike, so long as the Lord sees fit that we may live and inherit the
<44 yea, even as long as any of our posterity remains upon the face
of the <251

29:33 And many more <164 did king Mosiah write unto them, unfolding
unto them all the trials and troubles of a <227 king, yea, all the
travails of soul for <117 <441 and also all the murmurings of the
<148 to <12 <184 and he explained it all unto them.

29:34 And he told them that <197 <59 ought not to be; but that the
burden <145 come upon all the <45 that <126 man might bear his
part.

29:35 And he also unfolded unto them all the disadvantages they labored
under, by having an unrighteous king to rule over them;

29:36 Yea, all his <213 and abominations, and all the wars, and
contentions, and bloodshed, and the stealing, and the plundering, and
the committing of whoredoms, and all manner of <28 <382 cannot
be enumerated—telling them that <94 <94 <94 not to be, that they
were expressly repugnant to the commandments of God.

29:37 And now it came to pass, after king <178 had sent <32 <32
forth <255 the <152 they were convinced of the truth of his words.

29:38 Therefore they relinquished <167 desires for a <192 and became
exceedingly anxious that <142 man <151 have an equal chance
throughout all the land; yea, and <14 man expressed a willingness to
answer for his own sins.

29:39 Therefore, it came to pass that they assembled themselves
together in bodies <35 the <288 to cast in <60 voices
concerning who <52 be <7 <459 to <464 them <462 to the
law <139 had been given <180 and they were <77 rejoiced
because of the liberty <15 had been granted unto <256

29:40 And they did wax strong in love towards Mosiah; yea, they did
esteem him more than any other man; for they did not look upon him as a
tyrant who was seeking for gain, yea, for that lucre <50 doth corrupt
the soul; for he had not exacted riches of <356 neither had he
delighted in the shedding of blood; but he had established peace in the
<118 and he had <83 unto his <198 that they <119 be delivered
from all <255 of bondage; <499 they did <81 him, yea,
exceedingly, beyond measure.

29:41 And it came to pass that they did appoint judges to rule over
<66 or to <154 them <154 to the law; and this they did
<181 all the <453

29:42 And it came to pass that Alma was appointed to be the first chief
judge, he being also the high priest, his father <373 conferred the
office upon him, and <8 <196 him the charge <217 all the
affairs of the church.

29:43 And now it came to pass that Alma did walk in the ways of the
Lord, and he did keep his commandments, and he did <94 <508
judgments; and there was continual <156 through the <91

29:44 And thus commenced the reign of the <125 <107 all the
land of Zarahemla, <368 all the <171 who were called the Nephites;
and Alma was the <108 and <109 judge.

29:45 And now it came to pass that his <113 died, <121 eighty and
two years old, <113 lived to fulfil the <434 of God.

29:46 And it came to pass that <432 died also, in the thirty and
third year of his reign, <38 sixty and three <37 old; making in the
whole, five hundred and nine <11 from the time Lehi left Jerusalem.

29:47 And thus ended the <111 of the kings over the <103 of Nephi;
and thus <14 the days of Alma, who was the founder of <404 <185




 THE BOOK OF ALMA

THE SON OF ALMA

The account of <35 who was the son of Alma the first, and <145 <193
over the <60 of Nephi, and also the high priest over the Church. An
<30 of the <82 of the <466 and the wars and contentions <191
the people. And also an <19 of a war between the Nephites and the
Lamanites, <332 to the record of <63 the <202 and <57 <202

Alma Chapter 1

1:1 Now it came to pass that in the <22 year of the <60 of the
<254 over the <83 of <83 from this time forward, king <200
<220 gone the way of all the earth, <8 warred a good warfare,
walking uprightly before God, leaving none to <38 in his stead;
nevertheless he had <468 laws, and they were acknowledged by the
people; <454 they were obliged to abide by the laws which he had
made.

1:2 And it came to pass that in the <86 year of the <48 of Alma in
the judgment-seat, <361 was a man brought <65 him to be judged, a
man who was large, and was noted for his much strength.

1:3 And he had gone about <176 the people, preaching to them that
<68 he termed to be the word of God, bearing down against the church;
declaring unto the <144 that every <223 and teacher ought to become
popular; and they <7 not to labor with <289 hands, but that they
<11 to be supported by the <229

1:4 And he also testified unto the <41 that all mankind should be
saved at the last day, and that they need not fear nor tremble, but
that they might lift up <50 heads and rejoice; for the Lord had
created all men, and had also redeemed all men; and, in the end, all
men <48 have eternal life.

1:5 And it came to pass that he did teach these things so much that
many did believe on his words, even so many that they began to support
him and give him money.

1:6 And he <15 to be lifted up in the pride of his heart, and to wear
very costly apparel, yea, and even <21 to establish a church after
the manner of his preaching.

1:7 And it came to pass as he was going, to preach to those who
believed on his word, he met a man who belonged to the <39 of God,
yea, even one of <146 teachers; and he <55 to contend with him
sharply, that he <162 lead away the <190 of the <239 but the man
withstood him, admonishing him with the words of God.

1:8 Now the name of the man was Gideon; and it was he who was an
instrument in the hands of God in delivering the <46 of Limhi out of
bondage.

1:9 Now, because Gideon <52 him with the <50 of God he was
wroth with Gideon, and drew his sword and <91 to smite him. Now
<25 being stricken with many years, <416 he was not able to
withstand his blows, <10 he was slain by the sword.

1:10 And the man who slew him was taken by the <75 of the church,
and was <413 <413 Alma, to be judged according to the crimes <387
he had committed.

1:11 And it came to pass that he stood <26 Alma and pleaded for
himself with much boldness.

1:12 But Alma said unto him: Behold, this is the <478 time that
priestcraft has been introduced <443 this <389 And behold, thou art
not only guilty of priestcraft, but hast endeavored to enforce it by
the sword; and were <29 to be enforced <29 this <96 it
would prove <239 entire destruction.

1:13 And thou hast shed the blood of a righteous man, yea, a man who
has done much good <33 this people; and were we to spare thee his
<25 <40 come upon us for vengeance.

1:14 Therefore thou art condemned to die, <142 to the law <142
has been given us by Mosiah, our last king; and it has been
acknowledged by this <49 <200 this <85 must abide by the
law.

1:15 And it came to pass that they took him; and his name was Nehor;
and they carried him upon the top of the hill Manti, and there he was
caused, or rather did acknowledge, between the heavens and the earth,
that what he had taught to the <61 was contrary to the word of God;
and <33 he suffered an ignominious death.

1:16 Nevertheless, this did not put an end to the spreading of
<184 through the land; for <27 were many who loved the vain
things of the world, and they went forth preaching false doctrines; and
this they did for the sake of riches and honor.

1:17 <52 they durst not lie, if it were known, for fear of
the law, for liars were punished; <154 they pretended to <500
<184 to <240 belief; and now the law could have no power on any
man for his belief.

1:18 And they <48 not steal, for fear of the law, for such were
<44 neither <14 they rob, nor murder, for he that murdered was
punished unto <134

1:19 But it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church of
God <455 to persecute those that did <13 to the <13 of God, and
had <430 upon them the name of Christ.

1:20 Yea, they did <27 them, and afflict them with all manner of
words, and this because of <115 humility; <4 they were not proud
in <9 own eyes, and <11 they did impart the word of God, one
with another, without money and <3 price.

1:21 Now <212 was a strict law <369 the <256 of the <80 that
<13 should not any man, belonging to the <509 arise and <74
<102 that did not <103 to the <12 and that <23 <23 be no
persecution <37 themselves.

1:22 <225 <13 were many <10 them who <134 to be proud,
and <6 to contend warmly with <92 adversaries, even unto blows;
yea, they <426 smite one another with <13 fists.

1:23 Now this was in the second year of the reign of Alma, and it was a
cause of much affliction to the church; yea, it was the <11 of much
trial with the church.

1:24 For the hearts of many were hardened, and <54 names were blotted
out, that they were remembered no more <93 the <140 of God. And
also many withdrew themselves from <12 them.

1:25 Now this was a great <51 to <144 that did stand fast in the
faith; nevertheless, they were steadfast and immovable in keeping the
commandments of God, and they bore with patience the <157 which
was heaped upon <46

1:26 And when the priests left <81 labor to <236 the word of God
unto the people, the <80 also left <16 labors to hear the word of
God. And when the priest had imparted unto them the word of God they
all returned again diligently unto <28 labors; and the priest, not
esteeming himself above his hearers, for the preacher was no better
than the hearer, <394 was the teacher any <10 than the learner;
and thus they were all equal, and they did all labor, every man
<456 to his strength.

1:27 And they did <98 of <59 substance, <18 man <17 to
that <126 he had, to the poor, and the needy, and the sick, and the
afflicted; and they did not wear costly apparel, yet they were neat and
comely.

1:28 And thus they did establish the affairs of the <260 and thus
they <312 to have continual peace again, notwithstanding all <64
persecutions.

1:29 And now, <412 of the steadiness of the <386 they <25 to be
exceedingly rich, having abundance of all things whatsoever they stood
in need—an <10 of flocks and herds, and fatlings of <104 kind,
and also <13 of grain, and of gold, and of silver, and of
precious things, and <15 of silk and fine-twined linen, and all
<495 of good homely cloth.

1:30 And thus, in <83 prosperous circumstances, they did not send
away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or
that were <153 or that had not been nourished; and they did not set
<38 <376 upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old
and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the
<134 or in the <501 <131 no respect to persons as to <372 who
<134 in need.

1:31 And thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy than <21
who did not belong to <68 <451

1:32 For <14 who did not <13 to <13 <54 did indulge
<433 in sorceries, and in idolatry or idleness, and in babblings,
and in envyings and strife; wearing <260 apparel; being lifted up in
the pride of <33 own eyes; persecuting, lying, thieving, robbing,
committing whoredoms, and murdering, and all <178 of wickedness;
<455 the law was put in force upon all <66 who did
transgress it, inasmuch as it was possible.

1:33 And it came to pass that by thus exercising the law upon them,
<249 man suffering <354 to that <353 he had done, they became
more still, and durst not commit any wickedness if it were known;
therefore, there was much <325 among the <478 of Nephi until the
fifth year of the reign of the judges.

Alma Chapter 2

2:1 And it came to pass in the commencement of the <28 year of <126
<29 <46 <348 to be a contention <48 the people; for a certain
man, <151 called Amlici, he <4 a very cunning man, yea, a wise man
as to the wisdom of the world, he <18 after the order of the man that
slew Gideon by the sword, who was executed <123 to the law—

2:2 Now this Amlici had, by his cunning, drawn away much <111 <35
him; even so much that they <79 to be very powerful; and they <7
to endeavor to <474 <30 to be king over the people.

2:3 Now this was alarming to the <39 of the <324 and also to all
<221 who had not been <56 away <54 the persuasions of Amlici; for
they knew that <83 to <141 law that such <479 must be
established by the voice of the <53

2:4 Therefore, if it were possible that <70 should gain the <18 of
the people, he, <137 a wicked man, would deprive them of <43 rights
and privileges of the church; for it was his intent to destroy the
<359 of God.

2:5 And it came to pass that the <102 assembled <371 together
throughout all the land, <294 man <87 to his mind, <447 it
were for or against <218 in separate bodies, <448 much dispute and
wonderful contentions one with another.

2:6 And thus they did assemble <43 <43 to cast in <81
voices concerning the matter; and they were laid before the <301

2:7 And it came to pass that the <119 of the <77 came <58
<59 that he was not made king over the <150

2:8 Now this did cause much joy in the hearts of <198 who were <29
him; but <161 did stir up <11 who were in his favor to anger
<17 <10 who were not in his favor.

2:9 And it came to pass that they gathered <100 together, and did
consecrate <39 to be <104 king.

2:10 Now when <11 was made king over them he commanded them that
they <222 take up arms <53 <25 brethren; and this he did that
he might subject them to him.

2:11 Now the <122 of <39 were distinguished by the name of <127
<249 <408 Amlicites; and the remainder were <6 Nephites, or the
<23 of God.

2:12 Therefore the <9 of the Nephites were aware of the <258 of
the Amlicites, and therefore they did prepare to meet them; yea, they
did arm <112 with swords, and with cimeters, and with bows, and
with arrows, and with stones, and with slings, and with all manner of
weapons of war, of <277 kind.

2:13 And thus they were prepared to meet the Amlicites at the time of
<127 coming. And there were appointed captains, and higher <3
and chief <4 <309 to <16 numbers.

2:14 And it came to pass that <133 did arm his men with all <62 of
<62 of war of <62 kind; and he also <42 rulers and leaders
over his <401 to lead them to war <188 <45 brethren.

2:15 And it came to pass that the <80 came upon the hill Amnihu,
which was east of the river Sidon, <7 ran by the land of Zarahemla,
and <94 they began to make war with the Nephites.

2:16 Now Alma, <208 the <102 judge and the governor of the <196 of
Nephi, <186 he went up with his <77 yea, with his <122
and <24 <4 yea, at the head of his armies, <87 the
<76 to battle.

2:17 And they <60 to slay the <13 upon the hill east of Sidon.
And the <10 did contend with the <250 with great strength,
insomuch that many of the <10 did fall <437 the Amlicites.

2:18 Nevertheless the Lord did strengthen the hand of the <295
that they slew the <40 with <35 slaughter, that they <60 to
flee <32 them.

2:19 And it came to pass that the <48 did pursue the <27 all
that day, and did slay them with much <35 <69 that <157
were slain of the <20 twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two
souls; and <17 were <16 of the <40 six <16 five <16
sixty and two souls.

2:20 And it came to pass that when Alma could <61 the <41 no
longer he caused that his <188 <442 pitch <251 tents in the valley
of Gideon, the <5 <210 <412 after that Gideon who was <56 by
the hand of Nehor with the sword; and in this <21 the <68 did
<36 <36 <36 for the night.

2:21 And Alma sent spies to follow the remnant of the <430 that
he <489 know of <26 plans and <3 plots, whereby he <10 guard
himself <238 them, that he <8 preserve his <83 from <72
destroyed.

2:22 Now those whom he had sent out to watch the camp of the <113
were <94 Zeram, and Amnor, and Manti, and Limher; these were they
who went out with <56 men to <27 the camp of the <248

2:23 And it came to pass that on the morrow they returned into the camp
of the <119 in <250 haste, <73 greatly astonished, and struck
with much fear, saying:

2:24 Behold, we followed the camp of the <121 and to our <27
astonishment, in the land of Minon, above the land of <410 in the
course of the land of <389 we saw a numerous host of the Lamanites;
and behold, the <112 have joined them;

2:25 And they are upon our brethren in that land; and they are fleeing
<325 them with <118 flocks, and <3 wives, and <3 children,
towards our city; and except we make haste they obtain possession of
our city, and our fathers, and our <25 and our children be slain.

2:26 And it came to pass that the <205 of Nephi took <44 tents, and
departed out of the <267 of <285 <52 <12 <40 which was the
city of Zarahemla.

2:27 And <103 as they were crossing the river Sidon, the Lamanites
and the <152 <174 as <126 almost, as it were, as the sands
of the sea, came upon them to destroy <436

2:28 Nevertheless, the <204 <27 strengthened by the hand of the
Lord, having prayed mightily to him that he would deliver them out of
the hands of <80 enemies, therefore the Lord did hear <7 cries,
and did <503 <320 and the <73 and the <186 did fall
<168 <57

2:29 And it came to pass that Alma fought with Amlici with the sword,
face to face; and they did contend mightily, one with another.

2:30 And it came to pass that Alma, <90 a man of God, <5 exercised
with much faith, cried, <294 O <96 have mercy and spare my life,
that I may be an instrument in thy <97 to save and <402 this
people.

2:31 Now when Alma had said <380 words he contended again with Amlici;
and he was strengthened, insomuch that he slew <90 with the sword.

2:32 And he also <24 with the king of the <317 but the king
of the <136 fled back from <133 Alma and sent his guards to
<115 with Alma.

2:33 But <108 with his guards, <37 with the <18 of the king
of the <34 until he slew and drove them back.

2:34 And thus he cleared the ground, or rather the bank, <286 was on
the west of the <276 <276 throwing the bodies of the <37 who
had been slain into the waters of <16 that thereby his <333 might
have room to cross and <81 with the <25 and the <232 on
the west side of the <43 Sidon.

2:35 And it came to pass that when they had all crossed the <18 Sidon
that the <34 and the <34 began to flee <133 <277
notwithstanding they were so <346 that they could not be numbered.

2:36 And they fled <21 the <338 <394 the wilderness <108 was
west and north, away beyond the borders of the <479 and the <19
did pursue them with <330 might, and did slay <318

2:37 Yea, they were met on every hand, and <127 and driven, <171 they
were scattered on the west, and on the <48 <12 they had reached
the wilderness, <61 was called Hermounts; and it was that part of the
<74 <13 was infested by wild and ravenous beasts.

2:38 And it came to pass that many died in the <23 of <77
wounds, and were devoured by those beasts and also the vultures of the
air; and <18 bones have been found, and have been heaped up on the
earth.

Alma Chapter 3

3:1 And it came to pass that the <132 who were not <112 by the
weapons of war, after <491 buried <56 who had been slain—now the
number of the <20 were not numbered, because of the greatness of
<65 number—after they had finished burying <6 dead they all
returned to <7 lands, and to <4 houses, and <3 wives, and
<4 children.

3:2 Now many women and children had been <47 with the <496 and also
many of <22 flocks and <3 herds; and also many of <6 fields of
grain were destroyed, for they were trodden down by the hosts of men.

3:3 And now as many of the <297 and the <297 who had been
<53 upon the bank of the <316 <316 were cast into the <368 of
Sidon; and behold <53 <173 are in the depths of the sea, and they
are many.

3:4 And the <43 were distinguished from the Nephites, for they
had marked themselves with red in <35 foreheads <168 the manner of
the <503 nevertheless they had not shorn <14 heads like unto
the Lamanites.

3:5 Now the <12 of the <91 were shorn; and they were naked,
save it were skin <292 was girded about <32 loins, and also <4
armor, <11 was <11 <11 <407 and <9 bows, and <3 arrows,
and <4 stones, and <3 slings, and so forth.

3:6 And the skins of the <53 were dark, according to the mark
<38 was set upon <26 fathers, <6 was a curse upon them <252
of <11 transgression and <3 rebellion against <3 brethren, who
consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and Sam, who were just and holy
men.

3:7 And <24 brethren sought to destroy <84 therefore they were
cursed; and the Lord God set a mark upon <14 yea, upon Laman and
Lemuel, and also the sons of Ishmael, and Ishmaelitish women.

3:8 And this was done that <44 seed might be <197 from the
seed of <10 <78 that thereby the Lord God <15 preserve his
people, that they <7 not mix and believe in incorrect traditions
<116 would prove <26 destruction.

3:9 And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of
the <155 did bring the same <143 upon his seed.

3:10 Therefore, <24 suffered himself to be led away by the
<24 was called under that head, and there was a mark set upon
him.

3:11 And it came to pass that <35 <74 not <82 in the
tradition of the Lamanites, but believed <463 records <89 were
brought out of the land of Jerusalem, and also in the <22 of
<103 <224 <19 were correct, who <26 in the commandments of
God and kept <179 were <72 the <348 or the people of <225
from that time forth—

3:12 And it is they who have kept the <60 <41 are true of <47
<167 and also of the <32 of the <356

3:13 Now we will return again to the Amlicites, for they also had a
mark set upon them; yea, they set the mark upon themselves, yea, even a
mark of red upon <48 foreheads.

3:14 Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for these are the words <70
he said to Nephi: Behold, the <178 have I cursed, and I will set a
mark on them that they and <42 seed may be separated from thee and
thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever, except they repent of
<22 wickedness and turn to me that I may have mercy upon them.

3:15 And again: I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with
thy <320 that they may be cursed also.

3:16 And <27 I will set a mark upon him that fighteth <422 thee
and thy <292

3:17 And again, I say he that departeth from thee shall no more be
<221 thy seed; and I will bless thee, and whomsoever <15 be <12
thy <106 <103 and forever; and <149 were the promises of the
Lord unto Nephi and to his <52

3:18 Now the Amlicites knew not that they were fulfilling the <174 of
God when they began to mark themselves in <138 foreheads; nevertheless
they had come out in open rebellion <94 God; <487 it was
expedient that the <393 should fall upon <150

3:19 Now I <359 that ye <13 see that they <349 upon <42
the curse; and even so doth every man that is <152 <429 upon <417
his own condemnation.

3:20 Now it came to pass that not many days after the battle <260 was
fought in the land of Zarahemla, by the <263 and the <318
that <440 was another army of the <12 came in upon the <347 of
<380 in the same place where the first army met the Amlicites.

3:21 And it came to pass that <36 was an army sent to drive them out
of <140 land.

3:22 Now Alma <93 being afflicted with a wound did not go up to
<85 at this time <153 the Lamanites;

3:23 But he sent up a numerous army <14 <397 and they went up and
slew many of the <509 and drove the remainder of them out of the
borders of <63 <63

3:24 And then they returned <444 and <220 to establish peace in the
land, <74 troubled no more for a time with <28 enemies.

3:25 Now all <278 things were done, yea, all <6 wars and
contentions were commenced and ended in the fifth year of the reign of
the judges.

3:26 And in one year were thousands and tens of <4 of souls sent
to the eternal world, that they might reap <60 rewards according to
<5 works, whether they were good or <5 they were bad, to reap
<25 happiness or <3 misery, <22 to the spirit <243 they
listed to obey, <22 it be a good <12 or a bad one.

3:27 For <292 man receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to <26 and
this <39 to the <368 of the <30 of prophecy; <350 let it
be <14 to the truth. And thus endeth the <120 year of the <120
of the <120

Alma Chapter 4

4:1 Now it came to pass in the sixth year of the <26 of the judges
over the <309 of <308 <287 were no <170 nor wars in the
land of Zarahemla;

4:2 But the <21 were afflicted, yea, greatly <289 for the loss
of <149 brethren, and also for the loss of <8 flocks and herds, and
also for the loss of <11 fields of grain, <149 were trodden under
foot and destroyed by the Lamanites.

4:3 And so great were <23 afflictions that <150 soul had cause to
mourn; and they believed that it was the judgments of God sent upon
them because of <26 wickedness and <3 abominations; <155 they
were awakened to a remembrance of <11 duty.

4:4 And they <320 to <320 the church more fully; yea, and many
were baptized in the waters of Sidon and were joined to the <19 of
God; yea, they were <18 by the hand of Alma, who had been
consecrated the high priest over the <147 of the church, by the hand
of his father Alma.

4:5 And it came to pass in the seventh year of the <202 of the <202
<197 were about three thousand five hundred <340 that united
themselves to the <69 of God and were baptized. And thus <261 the
<34 year of the <34 of the <34 over the <67 of Nephi; and
<40 was continual <438 in all that time.

4:6 And it came to pass in the eighth year of the <34 of the judges,
that the <35 of the <59 <152 to wax proud, <180 of <166
exceeding riches, and <5 fine silks, and <4 fine-twined linen,
and <16 of <7 many <257 and <257 and <6 gold and <3
silver, and all manner of precious things, <259 they had obtained by
<15 industry; and in all <493 <499 were they lifted up in the
pride of <16 eyes, for they <66 to wear very costly apparel.

4:7 Now this was the <274 of much affliction to <202 yea, and to many
of the <97 whom Alma had <209 to be teachers, and priests,
and elders over the church; yea, many of them were sorely grieved for
the <292 <80 they saw had begun to be among <66 people.

4:8 For they saw and beheld with <342 sorrow that the <51 of the
<149 <83 to be <97 up in the <96 of <30 <96 and to set
<6 hearts upon riches and upon the vain <120 of the world, that
they <30 to be scornful, one towards another, and they <9 to
persecute those that did not believe according to <35 own will and
pleasure.

4:9 And thus, in this <228 year of the <228 of the <228 <255
<35 to be <86 <495 <101 the <86 of the <125 yea,
<15 were envyings, and strife, and malice, and persecutions, and
pride, even to exceed the <96 of <62 who did not belong to the
<114 of God.

4:10 And thus ended the <60 year of the <60 of the judges; and the
<165 of the <25 was a <64 stumbling-block to <39 who did
not <40 to the <68 and thus the <18 <83 to fail in its
progress.

4:11 And it came to pass in the commencement of the ninth year, Alma
saw the <49 of the <439 and he saw also that the example of
the <42 <42 to lead <58 who were unbelievers on from one piece
of iniquity to <178 thus bringing on the destruction of the <242

4:12 Yea, he saw <89 inequality <153 the people, some lifting
<450 up with <191 <144 despising others, turning <5 backs
upon the needy and the naked and <54 who were hungry, and <5 who
were athirst, and <6 who were sick and afflicted.

4:13 Now this was a <51 <351 for lamentations <53 the <53
while others were abasing themselves, succoring <28 who stood in need
of <56 succor, such as imparting <5 substance to the poor and the
needy, feeding the <59 and suffering all <435 of afflictions, for
Christ’s sake, who should come <284 to the spirit of prophecy;

4:14 Looking forward to that day, thus retaining a remission of <45
sins; being filled with <77 joy <489 of the resurrection of the
dead, <36 to the will and power and deliverance of Jesus Christ
from the bands of death.

4:15 And now it came to pass that <460 having seen the afflictions of
the humble followers of God, and the persecutions <440 were heaped
upon them by the remainder of his <135 and seeing all <74
inequality, <230 to be very sorrowful; nevertheless the Spirit of the
Lord did not fail him.

4:16 And he selected a wise man who was <172 the <503 of the <275
and gave him <94 <100 to the voice of the <52 that he might
have <13 to enact laws <16 to the laws <77 had been given,
and to put them in force <15 to the <318 and the crimes of
the <287

4:17 Now this man’s name was Nephihah, and he was appointed chief
judge; and he sat in the judgment-seat to judge and to govern the
<31

4:18 Now Alma did not grant unto him the office of <200 high priest
over the <99 but he retained the <13 of high <12 unto
himself; but he delivered the <45 unto Nephihah.

4:19 And this he did that he himself <114 go forth <137 his <122
or <5 the people of Nephi, that he <15 preach the word of God unto
them, to stir them up in remembrance of <196 duty, and that he <21
pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the
contentions <158 were <49 his <54 <227 no way that he <29
reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure testimony against
them.

4:20 And thus in the <505 of the <505 year of the reign of the
judges over the <93 of <93 Alma <123 up the <124 to
<185 and confined <117 wholly to the high priesthood of the
holy order of God, to the <54 of the word, <227 to the
<395 of revelation and prophecy.

Alma Chapter 5

5:1 Now it came to pass that Alma <323 to deliver the word of God unto
the <112 first in the land of Zarahemla, and from thence throughout
all the land.

5:2 And these are the words <140 he spake to the <97 in the church
<10 was established in the city of <35 <78 to his own
record, saying:

5:3 I, <420 <420 been consecrated by my father, <7 to be a high
<260 over the <38 of God, he <19 <357 and authority from God
to do <63 things, behold, I say unto you that he <102 to establish a
<27 in the land <67 was in the borders of Nephi; yea, the land
<11 was called the land of Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his
brethren in the waters of Mormon.

5:4 And <52 I say unto you, they were <208 out of the hands of
the <123 of king Noah, by the mercy and <85 of God.

5:5 And <31 after that, they were brought into bondage by the <30
of the Lamanites in the wilderness; yea, I say unto you, they were in
captivity, and again the Lord did <209 them out of <30 by the
<49 of his word; and we were <43 into this land, and here we
<132 to <132 the <131 of God <221 this land also.

5:6 And now <73 I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong to
this <455 have you sufficiently <456 in <402 the
captivity of your fathers? Yea, and have you <14 <14 in
<15 his <119 and long-suffering towards them? And moreover,
have ye <16 <16 in <15 that he has <150
<436 souls from hell?

5:7 Behold, he changed <11 hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a
deep sleep, and they awoke unto God. <20 they were in the midst of
darkness; nevertheless, <27 <38 were illuminated by the light of
the everlasting <133 yea, they were encircled about by the bands of
death, and the chains of hell, and an <20 destruction did await
<460

5:8 And now I ask of you, my <134 were they destroyed? <61 I
say unto you, Nay, they were not.

5:9 And <203 I ask, were the <52 of death broken, and the <52 of
hell <303 <67 them about, were they loosed? I say unto you, Yea,
they were loosed, and <98 <98 did expand, and they did sing
redeeming love. And I say unto you that they are saved.

5:10 And now I ask of you on what conditions are they saved? Yea, what
grounds had they to hope for salvation? What is the cause of <51
being loosed from the <84 of <135 yea, and also the <85 of <199

5:11 <118 I can tell you—did not my father Alma believe in the <492
<102 were <225 by the mouth of Abinadi? And was he not a holy
prophet? Did he not speak the <23 of God, and my <33 Alma <33
<266

5:12 And <511 to his faith there was a mighty change wrought in
his heart. Behold I say unto you that this is all true.

5:13 And <341 he preached the word unto your fathers, and a <32
<33 was also <35 in <116 hearts, and they humbled themselves
and put <9 trust in the true and living God. And <35 they were
faithful until the end; therefore they were <177

5:14 And now <18 I ask of you, my brethren of the <390 have ye
spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your
countenances? Have ye experienced this <74 <73 in your hearts?

5:15 Do ye exercise <122 in the redemption of him who created you? Do
you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised
in immortality, and this corruption <7 in incorruption, to stand
before God to be judged <167 to the deeds <207 have been done in
the <31 body?

5:16 I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the
voice of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day: Come unto me ye
blessed, for <133 your works have been the <4 of righteousness
upon the face of the earth?

5:17 Or do ye <48 to <48 that ye can lie unto the Lord in
that day, and say—Lord, our <34 have been righteous <4 upon the
face of the earth—and that he will save you?

5:18 Or otherwise, can ye <42 <41 brought <121 the
tribunal of God with your <411 filled with guilt and remorse, having a
remembrance of all your guilt, yea, a perfect <8 of all your
wickedness, yea, a <8 that ye have set at defiance the
commandments of God?

5:19 I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure
heart and clean hands? I say unto you, can you look up, <64 the
<260 of God engraven upon your <262

5:20 I say unto you, can ye think of <451 saved when you have yielded
<109 to become subjects to the devil?

5:21 I say unto you, ye will know at that day that ye cannot be saved;
for <414 can no man be <39 except his garments are washed white;
yea, his <7 must be purified <368 they are cleansed from all
stain, through the blood of him of whom it has been spoken by our
<423 who should come to redeem his people from <413 sins.

5:22 And now I ask of you, my brethren, how will any of you feel, if ye
shall <332 <210 the bar of God, <137 your <67 stained with
<57 and all manner of filthiness? Behold, what will these things
testify against you?

5:23 <509 will they not <11 that ye are murderers, yea, and also
that ye are guilty of all <35 of wickedness?

5:24 <39 my <70 do ye suppose that such an one can have a
place to sit down in the kingdom of God, with Abraham, with Isaac, and
with Jacob, and also all the holy prophets, whose <87 are <149
and are spotless, pure and white?

5:25 I say unto you, Nay; <182 ye make our Creator a liar from the
beginning, or <64 that he is a liar from the <10 ye <215
<12 that such can have <72 in the <69 of heaven; but they
<153 be cast out for they are the children of the <17 of the
devil.

5:26 And now <451 I say unto you, my <121 if ye have
experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of
redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?

5:27 Have ye walked, keeping <321 blameless <220 God? Could ye
say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye
have been sufficiently humble? That your <152 have been <153
and made white <302 the <245 of Christ, who will come to <292 his
<293 from <293 sins?

5:28 <218 are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye
are not prepared to meet God. <266 ye must prepare quickly; for the
<142 of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal
life.

5:29 <50 I say, is <403 one among you who is not <58 of envy?
I say unto you that such an one is not prepared; and I <149 that he
<388 <58 quickly, for the hour is close at <55 and he knoweth
not when the time <223 come; for such an one is not found guiltless.

5:30 And again I say unto you, is <67 one <67 you that doth make a
mock of his brother, or that heapeth upon him persecutions?

5:31 Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time is at
hand that he must repent or he <306 be saved!

5:32 Yea, even wo unto all ye workers of iniquity; repent, <1 for
the Lord God hath <503 it!

5:33 <147 he sendeth an invitation unto all men, for the arms of
mercy are extended towards them, and he saith: Repent, and I will
receive you.

5:34 Yea, he <14 Come unto me and ye <137 partake of the fruit of
the tree of life; yea, ye <13 eat and drink of the bread and the
waters of life freely;

5:35 Yea, come unto me and bring forth works of righteousness, and ye
<31 not be hewn down and cast into the fire—

5:36 For <397 the time is at hand that whosoever bringeth <31 not
good fruit, or <8 doeth not the <40 of <40 the same
have cause to wail and mourn.

5:37 O ye <153 of <153 ye that are puffed up in the vain things
of the world, ye that have professed to have known the ways of
righteousness nevertheless have gone astray, as sheep having no
shepherd, notwithstanding a shepherd hath <420 after you and is still
calling <7 you, but ye will not hearken unto his voice!

5:38 <200 I say unto you, that the good <32 doth call you; yea,
and in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of Christ; and
if ye will not <43 unto the voice of the good <69 to the name
by <25 ye are called, <153 ye are not the <88 of the good
shepherd.

5:39 And now if ye are not the <17 of the good <36 of what fold
are ye? <85 I say unto you, that the devil is your <17 and ye
are of his fold; and now, who can deny this? <24 I say unto you,
<201 denieth this is a liar and a child of the devil.

5:40 For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God, and
<8 is evil <8 from the <25

5:41 Therefore, if a man <253 <253 good <245 he hearkeneth unto
the <131 of the good <78 and he doth follow him; but <65
<22 <22 evil works, the same becometh a <67 of the devil, for
he <32 unto his voice, and doth <26 him.

5:42 And <30 <296 this must <388 his wages of him; therefore,
for his <7 he receiveth death, as to <282 pertaining unto
<313 being dead unto all good works.

5:43 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should hear me, for I speak
in the energy of my soul; for <214 I have <475 unto you plainly
that ye <506 err, or have <11 according to the commandments of
God.

5:44 For I am <317 to <40 <312 this manner, <20 to the holy
order of God, <261 is in Christ Jesus; yea, I am commanded to stand
and testify unto this people the <98 <19 have been <51 by our
fathers concerning the <11 <11 are to come.

5:45 And this is not all. Do ye not suppose that I know of these <23
myself? <255 I <44 unto you that I do know that <14 <14
whereof I have <49 are true. And how do ye <32 that I know of
their surety?

5:46 <35 I say unto you they are made <449 unto me by the Holy
Spirit of God. <18 I have fasted and prayed many days that I might
know <56 <56 of myself. And now I do know of myself that they are
true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy
Spirit; and this is the spirit of revelation <129 is in me.

5:47 And moreover, I say unto you that it has thus been revealed unto
me, that the words <26 have been <117 by our <165 are true, even
so <205 to the <44 of prophecy <18 is in me, <4 is also by
the manifestation of the <111 of God.

5:48 I say unto you, that I know of <100 that <397 I shall say
unto you, <213 that <35 is to come, is <111 and I say unto
you, that I know that Jesus <256 <25 <16 yea, the Son, the Only
Begotten of the Father, full of grace, and mercy, and truth. And
<324 it is he that <447 to take away the sins of the world, yea,
the sins of every man who steadfastly believeth on his name.

5:49 And now I say unto you that this is the <325 <334 <82 I am
called, yea, to preach unto my beloved <397 yea, and <38 one
that dwelleth in the land; yea, to <17 unto all, both old and young,
both bond and free; yea, I say unto you the aged, and also the middle
<6 and the rising generation; yea, to cry unto them that they must
repent and be born again.

5:50 Yea, thus saith the Spirit: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, for
the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand; yea, the Son of God <136 in
his glory, in his might, majesty, power, and dominion. Yea, my <102
<103 I say unto you, that the <229 saith: Behold the glory of
the King of all the earth; and also the King of <51 <204 very soon
shine forth among all the children of men.

5:51 And also the <38 <87 unto me, yea, crieth unto me with a
mighty voice, saying: Go <29 and say unto this people—Repent, for
except ye <122 ye can in nowise inherit the <105 of heaven.

5:52 And again I say unto you, the <46 <84 <423 the ax is laid
at the root of the tree; therefore <206 tree that bringeth not <51
good fruit <89 be hewn down and cast into the fire, yea, a fire <241
cannot be consumed, even an unquenchable fire. <43 and remember,
the Holy One hath <394 it.

5:53 And now my <155 <154 I say unto you, can ye withstand
<480 sayings; yea, can ye lay aside <7 things, and trample the Holy
One under your feet; yea, can ye be puffed up in the pride of your
hearts; yea, will ye still persist in the wearing of costly apparel and
setting your hearts upon the vain things of the <360 upon your
riches?

5:54 Yea, will ye <30 in supposing that ye are better one than
another; yea, will ye <14 in the persecution of your <94 who
humble themselves and do walk <371 the holy <375 of God, wherewith
they have been brought into this church, having been sanctified by the
Holy Spirit, and they do bring <172 works <158 are meet for
repentance—

5:55 Yea, and will you <57 in turning your backs upon the poor, and
the needy, and in withholding your substance from them?

5:56 And finally, all ye that will <29 in your wickedness, I say
unto you that <168 are they who <227 be hewn down and cast into the
fire <284 they speedily repent.

5:57 And now I say unto you, all you that are desirous to follow the
voice of the good shepherd, come ye out from the wicked, and be ye
separate, and touch not their unclean things; and behold, <5 names
<60 be blotted out, that the <8 of the wicked <10 not be
numbered <385 the <11 of the righteous, that the word of God may be
fulfilled, <147 <341 The <16 of the <27 <27 not be mingled
with the <11 of my people;

5:58 For the <10 of the righteous <21 be written in the book of
life, and unto them will I grant an inheritance at my right hand. And
now, my <237 what have ye to say against this? I say unto you, if
ye speak <10 it, it matters not, for the word of God must be
fulfilled.

5:59 For what shepherd is there <107 you <255 many sheep doth not
watch over them, that the wolves enter not and devour his flock? And
<148 if a wolf <12 his flock doth he not drive him out? Yea, and
at the last, if he can, he will destroy him.

5:60 And now I say unto you that the good <64 doth call <332 you;
and if you will hearken unto his <223 he will <319 you into his fold,
and ye are his sheep; and he commandeth you that ye suffer no ravenous
wolf to <74 <101 you, that ye may not be destroyed.

5:61 And now I, Alma, do command you in the language of him who hath
commanded me, that ye observe to do the words <229 I have spoken unto
you.

5:62 I <173 by way of <35 unto you that belong to the church; and
unto those who do not <11 to the church I <24 by way of
invitation, saying: Come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye also
may be partakers of the fruit of the tree of life.

Alma Chapter 6

6:1 And now it came to pass that <154 Alma had made an end of speaking
unto the people of the <486 <96 was established in the city of
Zarahemla, he ordained priests and elders, by laying on his hands
according to the order of God, to preside and <254 over the church.

6:2 And it came to pass that whosoever did not <111 to the <111 who
repented of <412 sins were <107 unto <107 and were received
into the <34

6:3 And it also came to pass that <35 did <34 to the <34
that did not repent of <36 wickedness and humble themselves before
God—I mean <168 who were lifted up in the pride of <18 hearts—the
same were rejected, and <7 <417 were <471 out, that <6 <6
were not <467 <259 <29 of the righteous.

6:4 And thus they began to establish the <120 of the <63 in the
city of Zarahemla.

6:5 Now I would that ye should understand that the word of God was
liberal unto all, that none were deprived of the privilege of
assembling <90 together to hear the word of God.

6:6 Nevertheless the children of God were <307 that they <43
gather <24 <24 oft, and join in fasting and mighty prayer
in behalf of the welfare of the souls of <100 who knew not God.

6:7 And now it came to pass that when Alma had made these regulations
he departed from <477 yea, from the <112 <259 was in the city of
<258 and went over upon the east of the river Sidon, into the
valley of Gideon, there having been a city built, <30 was called the
city of <14 <8 was in the <21 that was <13 <9 being
<4 <324 the man who was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword.

6:8 And Alma went and <192 to declare the word of God unto the <82
<45 was <342 in the <46 of <44 <330 to the
revelation of the truth of the word <19 had been <457 by his
fathers, and <20 to the spirit of prophecy <15 was in him,
<11 to the testimony of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who <188
come to redeem his <403 from <280 sins, and the holy <263 by <32
he was called. And thus it is written. Amen.

Alma <451 7

7:1 Behold my beloved brethren, seeing that I have been permitted to
come unto you, therefore I attempt to address you in my language; yea,
by my own mouth, <26 that it is the first time that I have <105
unto you by the words of my <20 I <196 been wholly confined to the
judgment-seat, <8 had much business that I could not come unto you.

7:2 And even I <12 not have come now at this time were it not that
the judgment-seat hath been given to another, to reign in my stead; and
the Lord in much mercy hath granted that I <149 come unto you.

7:3 And behold, I have come <67 great hopes and much desire that I
<22 find that ye had humbled yourselves <476 God, and that ye had
continued in the supplicating of his grace, that I <23 find that ye
were blameless <23 him, that I <11 find that ye were not in the
awful dilemma that our brethren were in at <463

7:4 But blessed be the name of God, that he hath <107 me to know, yea,
hath <7 unto me the exceedingly <86 joy of knowing that they are
<306 again in the way of his righteousness.

7:5 And I trust, <284 to the Spirit of God <263 is in me, that I
shall also have joy over you; nevertheless I do not <128 that my joy
over you <97 come by the cause of so much afflictions and sorrow
<36 I have had for the <102 at <449 for <166 my joy
cometh over them <415 wading through much affliction and sorrow.

7:6 But <19 I trust that ye are not in a state of so much unbelief
as were your brethren; I <18 that ye are not lifted up in the pride
of your hearts; yea, I <16 that ye have not set your hearts upon
riches and the vain things of the world; yea, I <20 that you do not
worship idols, but that ye do <6 the true and living God, and that
ye look forward for the remission of your <419 with an everlasting
faith, <120 is to come.

7:7 For <100 I say unto you there be many <58 to come; and
<13 <9 is one thing <27 is of more importance than they
all—for <14 the time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth
and <155 among his people.

7:8 Behold, I do not say that he will come <16 us at the time of his
dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; for <44 the <241 hath not said
unto me that this <223 be the case. Now as to this <73 I do not
know; but this much I do <304 that the Lord God hath power to do all
<104 <95 are <286 to his word.

7:9 But <53 the <53 hath said this much unto me, saying: Cry
unto this people, saying—Repent ye, and prepare the way of the Lord,
and walk in his paths, <41 are straight; for <34 the kingdom of
heaven is at hand, and the Son of God <132 upon the face of the
earth.

7:10 And <27 he <345 be born of Mary, at Jerusalem <40 is the
land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and chosen
vessel, who <26 be overshadowed and conceive by the <113 of the Holy
Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son of God.

7:11 And he <30 go forth, suffering pains and <382 and
temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled
<71 saith he will take upon him the <26 and the sicknesses of his
<237

7:12 And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of
death <36 bind his people; and he will take upon him their
infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, <207 to the
flesh, that he may know <9 to the flesh how to succor his people
<10 to <32 infirmities.

7:13 Now the <225 knoweth all things; <507 the Son of God
suffereth <21 to the <31 that he <107 take upon him the sins
of his <239 that he <12 blot out <40 transgressions <23 to
the <169 of his deliverance; and now <210 this is the testimony
<100 is in me.

7:14 Now I say unto you that ye must repent, and be born again; for the
<74 <160 if ye are not born again ye cannot inherit the <277 of
heaven; therefore come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye may be
washed from your <471 that ye may have faith on the Lamb of God, who
taketh away the sins of the world, who is mighty to save and to cleanse
from all unrighteousness.

7:15 Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside <250 sin,
<106 easily doth beset you, <5 doth bind you down to destruction,
yea, come and go <279 and show unto your God that ye are willing to
repent of your sins and enter into a covenant with him to keep his
commandments, and witness it unto him this day by going into the waters
of baptism.

7:16 And whosoever doeth this, and keepeth the commandments of God from
thenceforth, the same will remember that I say unto him, yea, he will
<10 that I have said unto him, he <362 have eternal life,
<225 to the <214 of the Holy Spirit, <106 testifieth in me.

7:17 And now my beloved brethren, do you believe these things? Behold,
I say unto you, yea, I know that ye <14 them; and the way that I
know that ye <11 them is by the manifestation of the <241 <49
is in me. And now because your <215 is strong concerning that, yea,
<4 the things <19 I have spoken, great is my joy.

7:18 For as I said unto you from the beginning, that I had much desire
that ye were not in the state of dilemma like your <94 even so I
have found that my desires have been gratified.

7:19 For I perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness; I
<11 that ye are in the path <75 leads to the <328 of God;
yea, I <17 that ye are making his <28 straight.

7:20 I <13 that it has been made known unto you, by the <182
of his word, that he <368 walk in crooked paths; neither doth he vary
from that <53 he hath said; <11 hath he a shadow of turning from
the right to the left, or from that <21 is <9 to that <5 is
wrong; therefore, his course is one <242 round.

7:21 And he doth not dwell in unholy temples; <45 can filthiness or
anything <29 is unclean be received into the <111 of God;
<439 I say unto you the time <282 come, yea, and it <5 be at
the last day, that he who is filthy <12 remain in his filthiness.

7:22 And now my <287 <193 I have said <287 <237 unto you
that I might awaken you to a sense of your duty to God, that ye may
walk blameless before him, that ye may walk after the holy order of
God, <7 <90 ye have been received.

7:23 And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and
gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering;
being temperate in all things; <5 diligent in keeping the
<426 of God at all times; asking for whatsoever <91 ye stand
in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God
for <18 <18 ye do receive.

7:24 And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will
<30 abound in good works.

7:25 And may the Lord bless you, and keep your garments spotless, that
ye may at last be brought to sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
and the holy prophets who have been ever since the world began, having
your <34 spotless even as their <5 are <40 in the
<240 of heaven to go no more out.

7:26 And now my <215 <215 I have spoken <215 words unto you
according to the <478 <186 testifieth in me; and my soul doth
exceedingly rejoice, <482 of the exceeding diligence and heed <18
ye have given unto my word.

7:27 And now, may the peace of God rest upon you, and upon your houses
and lands, and upon your flocks and herds, and all that you possess,
your women and your children, <68 to your faith and good works,
from this time forth and forever. And thus I have spoken. Amen.

Alma Chapter 8

8:1 And now it came to pass that Alma returned from the land of Gideon,
<296 <153 taught the people of Gideon many <231 <100 <462 be
written, <13 established the <317 of the church, <66 as he
had <335 done in the land of Zarahemla, yea, he <42 to his own
house at Zarahemla to rest himself from the labors <40 he had
performed.

8:2 And thus ended the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the
<69 of Nephi.

8:3 And it came to pass in the commencement of the tenth year of the
<29 of the <29 over the <28 of Nephi, that Alma departed from
thence and took his journey over into the land of Melek, on the west of
the river Sidon, on the west by the borders of the wilderness.

8:4 And he began to teach the <46 in the land of Melek <132 to
the holy <141 of God, by <113 he had been called; and he <26 to
<27 the <27 throughout all the land of Melek.

8:5 And it came to pass that the <18 came to him <21 all the
<67 of the land <42 was by the wilderness side. And they were
baptized <19 all the land;

8:6 So that when he had finished his work at <80 he <128 thence,
and traveled three days’ <128 on the north of the land of Melek; and
he came to a city <53 was called Ammonihah.

8:7 Now it was the custom of the <80 of Nephi to call <422 <341
and <4 cities, and <3 villages, yea, even all <5 small
<7 <293 the name of him who first possessed them; and thus it
was with the land of <51

8:8 And it came to pass that when Alma had come to the city of
Ammonihah he <164 to preach the word of God unto them.

8:9 Now Satan had gotten great hold upon the hearts of the <85 of
the city of Ammonihah; therefore they would not hearken unto the <488
of Alma.

8:10 Nevertheless Alma labored much in the spirit, wrestling with God
in mighty prayer, that he <29 pour out his <509 upon the <45 who
were in the city; that he <16 also grant that he might baptize them
unto repentance.

8:11 Nevertheless, they hardened <140 hearts, saying unto him: Behold,
we know that thou art Alma; and we know that thou art high priest over
the church <197 thou hast <442 in many parts of the land,
<312 to your tradition; and we are not of thy <455 and we do
not believe in such foolish traditions.

8:12 And now we know that because we are not of thy <48 we know that
thou hast no power over us; and thou hast delivered up the
judgment-seat unto Nephihah; <158 thou art not the chief judge
over us.

8:13 Now when the <137 had said this, and withstood all his words,
and reviled him, and spit upon him, and caused that he should be cast
out of <137 city, he <335 <461 and took his <333 towards the
city <125 was <322 Aaron.

8:14 And it came to pass that while he was journeying thither, being
weighed down with sorrow, wading through much tribulation and anguish
of soul, <118 of the wickedness of the <80 who were in the city
of Ammonihah, it came to pass <39 Alma was thus <36 down with
<37 behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto him, saying:

8:15 Blessed art thou, <217 therefore, lift up thy head and rejoice,
for thou hast <320 cause to rejoice; for thou hast been faithful in
keeping the commandments of God from the time <110 thou receivedst thy
<395 message from him. <264 I am he that <188 it unto you.

8:16 And behold, I am sent to command thee that thou return to the city
of <100 and <394 again unto the <114 of the <328 yea, <9
unto <400 Yea, say unto them, except they repent the Lord God will
destroy <14

8:17 For <49 they do study at this time that they may <17 the
liberty of thy people, (for thus saith the Lord) <94 is contrary to
the statutes, and judgments, and <110 <11 he has given unto
his people.

8:18 Now it came to pass that after Alma had received his <122 from
the <178 of the Lord he returned speedily to the land of Ammonihah.
And he entered the city by another way, yea, by the way <52 is on the
south of the city of <24

8:19 And as he <28 the city he was an hungered, and he said to a
man: Will ye give to an humble servant of God something to eat?

8:20 And the man said unto him: I am a Nephite, and I know that thou
art a holy prophet of God, for thou art the man whom an <102 said in a
vision: Thou shalt receive. Therefore, go with me into my house and I
will impart unto thee of my food; and I know that thou wilt be a
blessing unto me and my house.

8:21 And it came to pass that the man <161 him into his house; and
the man was <405 Amulek; and he brought forth bread and meat and set
before Alma.

8:22 And it came to pass that Alma ate <20 and was filled; and he
blessed Amulek and his house, and he gave thanks unto God.

8:23 And <223 he had eaten and was filled he said unto Amulek: I am
Alma, and am the high priest over the church of God throughout the
land.

8:24 And <308 I have been <87 to <337 the word of God among all
this <307 according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy; and I
was in this land and they would not receive me, but they cast me out
and I was about to set my back towards this land forever.

8:25 But <60 I have been commanded that I should turn <408 and
prophesy unto this <60 yea, and to testify against them concerning
their iniquities.

8:26 And now, Amulek, because thou hast fed me and taken me in, thou
art blessed; for I was an <309 for I had fasted many days.

8:27 And Alma tarried many days with <176 <199 he began to <126
unto the <404

8:28 And it came to pass that the <484 did wax more gross in <70
<71

8:29 And the word came to <186 saying: Go; and also say unto my
<360 <84 go <256 and <108 unto this <108 saying—Repent
ye, for thus <478 the Lord, except ye repent I will visit this <51
in mine anger; yea, and I will not turn my fierce anger away.

8:30 And Alma went forth, and also <48 <214 the <44 to declare
the words of God unto them; and they were <268 with the Holy Ghost.

8:31 And they had power given unto them, insomuch that they could not
be confined in dungeons; neither was it possible that any man <14
slay <40 nevertheless they did not exercise <128 <31 until they
were bound in bands and cast into prison. Now, this was done that the
Lord might show <127 his <24 in them.

8:32 And it came to pass that they went <17 and <194 to <194 and
to <150 unto the <106 <318 to the <318 and <32 which
the Lord had <92 <37

Alma Chapter 9

9:1 And again, I, <194 having been <299 of God that I <301 take
<244 and go <52 and <50 <308 unto this <47 or the <184
who were in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass as I <74 to <24
unto <148 they <7 to contend with me, <243

9:2 Who art thou? Suppose ye that we shall believe the testimony of one
man, although he <64 <33 unto us that the earth <7 pass away?

9:3 Now they understood not the <219 <112 they spake; for they knew
not that the <24 <24 pass <252

9:4 And they said also: We will not <54 thy <28 if thou shouldst
<154 that this great city <26 be destroyed in one day.

9:5 Now they knew not that God <232 do such marvelous works, for they
were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked <383

9:6 And they said: Who is God, that sendeth no more authority than one
man <314 this <161 to <314 unto them the truth of such <63 and
<45 things?

9:7 And they stood <188 to lay <283 hands on me; but <510 they did
not. And I <16 with boldness to <38 unto <180 yea, I did boldly
<510 unto <8 <182

9:8 Behold, O ye wicked and perverse generation, how have ye forgotten
the tradition of your fathers; yea, how soon ye have <12 the
commandments of God.

9:9 Do ye not remember that our father, Lehi, was brought out of
Jerusalem by the hand of God? Do ye not <19 that they were all led
by him through the wilderness?

9:10 And have ye <51 so soon how many times he delivered our
fathers out of the <118 of <121 enemies, and preserved them from
being destroyed, even by the <14 of <14 own brethren?

9:11 Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless power, and his
mercy, and his long-suffering towards us, we <239 unavoidably have
been cut off from the face of the <278 long before this period of
time, and perhaps been consigned to a state of endless misery and woe.

9:12 <167 now I say unto you that he commandeth you to repent; and
except ye repent, ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. But
<222 this is not all—he has <435 you to <21 or he will
utterly destroy you from off the face of the earth; yea, he will visit
you in his anger, and in his fierce anger he will not turn <369

9:13 <75 do ye not <192 the <366 <394 he spake unto <214
saying that: Inasmuch as ye <435 keep my commandments, ye <5
prosper in the land? And <492 it is said <20 <20 as ye will not
keep my <260 ye <22 be cut off from the presence of the Lord.

9:14 Now I would that ye <175 remember, that inasmuch as the
Lamanites have not kept the <33 of God, they have been cut off
from the <36 of the <36 Now we see that the word of the Lord has
been verified in this thing, and the <38 have been cut off from
his presence, from the beginning of <261 transgressions in the land.

9:15 Nevertheless I say unto you, that it <93 be more tolerable for
them in the day of judgment than for you, if ye remain in your sins,
yea, and even more <23 for them in this life than for you, <234
ye repent.

9:16 For there are many promises <179 are extended to the Lamanites;
for it is because of the traditions of <79 <361 that caused them
to <53 in <9 <296 of ignorance; therefore the Lord will be
merciful unto them and prolong <15 existence in the <103

9:17 And at some <332 of time they will be <444 to believe in his
word, and to know of the incorrectness of the <59 of <35
<488 and many of them will be saved, for the Lord will be <55
unto all who call on his name.

9:18 But <336 I say unto you that if ye persist in your wickedness
that your days <167 not be prolonged in the land, for the <205
<11 be sent upon you; and if ye repent not they <11 come in a time
when you know not, and ye <12 be visited with utter destruction; and
it <9 be according to the <364 <364 of the <267

9:19 For he will not suffer you that ye <22 live in your iniquities,
to <409 his people. I say unto you, Nay; he <325 rather <22 that
the <78 might <17 all his people who are called the <5 of
Nephi, if it were possible that they could fall into sins and
transgressions, after having had so much light and so much knowledge
given unto them of the Lord <176 God;

9:20 Yea, <24 <24 been such a highly favored <48 of the Lord;
yea, <13 <13 been <10 above every other nation, kindred,
tongue, or people; <13 <13 had all things made known unto them,
<129 to <45 desires, and <3 faith, and prayers, of that <304
has been, and <5 is, and <3 is to come;

9:21 Having been <167 by the Spirit of God; <44 conversed with
angels, and <6 been spoken unto by the voice of the <76 and
<12 the spirit of prophecy, and the <5 of revelation, and also
many gifts, the gift of speaking with tongues, and the gift of
preaching, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the gift of translation;

9:22 Yea, and <108 <46 been delivered of God out of the land of
Jerusalem, by the hand of the <66 <18 been saved from famine, and
from sickness, and all manner of diseases of <150 kind; and they
<20 waxed strong in battle, that they <230 not be destroyed; <11
been <387 out of bondage time <58 time, and <11 been kept and
preserved until now; and they have been prospered <7 they are rich
in all <51 of things—

9:23 And now behold I say unto you, that if this people, who have
received so many blessings from the hand of the Lord, should transgress
contrary to the <271 and <269 <200 they do have, I say unto you
that if this be the case, that if they <27 fall into transgression,
it <336 be far more tolerable for the <337 than for them.

9:24 For <449 the promises of the Lord are extended to the
Lamanites, but they are not unto you if ye transgress; for has not the
Lord expressly promised and firmly decreed, that if ye will rebel
against him that ye <410 utterly be destroyed from off the face of the
earth?

9:25 And now for this cause, that ye may not be destroyed, the Lord has
sent his angel to visit many of his <144 declaring unto them that
they must go forth and cry mightily unto this <15 saying: Repent
ye, for the kingdom of heaven is nigh at hand;

9:26 And not many days hence the Son of God <81 come in his glory;
and his glory <9 be the <4 of the Only Begotten of the Father,
full of grace, equity, and truth, full of patience, mercy, and
long-suffering, quick to hear the cries of his <452 and to answer
<423 prayers.

9:27 And <176 he cometh to redeem those who will be baptized unto
repentance, through faith on his name.

9:28 Therefore, prepare ye the way of the <255 for the time is at hand
that all men <84 reap a reward of <52 works, <482 to that
<267 they have been—if they have been righteous they <20 reap the
salvation of <21 souls, <21 to the power and deliverance of
Jesus Christ; and if they have been evil they <25 reap the damnation
of <25 <25 <25 to the <25 and captivation of the devil.

9:29 Now <107 this is the <499 of the angel, crying unto the
people.

9:30 And now, my beloved brethren, for ye are my <5 and ye ought
to be beloved, and ye <7 to bring <232 works <97 are meet for
<141 seeing that your hearts have been grossly hardened <300
the word of God, and <15 that ye are a lost and a fallen <59

9:31 Now it came to pass that when I, Alma, had spoken these words,
<90 the <211 were wroth with me because I said unto them that
they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked <40

9:32 And also <21 I said unto them that they were a lost and a
<61 <40 they were angry with me, and sought to lay <158 hands
upon me, that they might cast me into prison.

9:33 But it came to pass that the Lord did not suffer them that they
<478 take me at that time and cast me into <30

9:34 And it came to pass that Amulek went and stood forth, and began to
preach unto them also. And now the words of <18 are not all written,
nevertheless a part of his <13 are written in this book.

Alma Chapter 10

10:1 Now <153 are the <20 <203 <33 preached unto the <117 who
were in the land of Ammonihah, <444

10:2 I am Amulek; I am the son of Giddonah, who was the son of Ishmael,
who was a descendant of Aminadi; and it was the same Aminadi who
interpreted the writing <52 was upon the wall of the temple, <8
was <82 by the finger of God.

10:3 And <28 was a <39 of Nephi, who was the son of Lehi,
who came out of the land of Jerusalem, who was a <21 of
Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph who was sold into Egypt by the
<217 of his brethren.

10:4 And <279 I am also a man of no small reputation among all <483
who know me; yea, and <19 I have many kindreds and friends, and I
have also acquired much riches by the hand of my industry.

10:5 Nevertheless, after all this, I never have known much of the ways
of the <506 and his mysteries and marvelous power. I said I <20 had
<21 much of <204 things; but <59 I mistake, for I have seen much
of his <27 and his <28 power; yea, even in the preservation
of the lives of this <363

10:6 <66 I did harden my heart, for I was called many times
and I would not hear; therefore I knew concerning <57 things, yet I
<12 not know; <12 I went on rebelling <459 God, in the
wickedness of my <38 even until the fourth day of this seventh
month, <229 is in the tenth year of the reign of the judges.

10:7 As I was journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an angel of
the Lord appeared unto me and said: Amulek, return to thine own house,
for thou shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is a
chosen man of God; for he has fasted many days <487 of the sins of
this people, and he is an hungered, and thou <40 receive him into thy
house and feed him, and he shall bless thee and thy house; and the
blessing of the Lord <13 rest upon thee and thy house.

10:8 And it came to pass that I obeyed the voice of the angel, and
returned towards my <23 And as I was going thither I found the man
whom the <127 said unto me: Thou <73 <73 into thy house—and
<140 it was this same man who has been speaking unto you <211
the things of God.

10:9 And the <35 said unto me he is a holy man; wherefore I know he
is a holy man <136 it was said by an <24 of God.

10:10 And again, I know that the <46 whereof he hath testified are
true; for <70 I say unto you, that as the Lord liveth, even so has
he sent his <39 to make <288 <30 manifest unto me; and this he
has done while this Alma hath dwelt at my <133

10:11 For <366 he hath blessed mine <242 he hath <5 me, and
my women, and my children, and my father and my kinsfolk; yea, even all
my kindred hath he blessed, and the <206 of the Lord hath rested
upon us according to the words <327 he spake.

10:12 And now, when Amulek had spoken <84 <15 the people began to
be astonished, seeing there was more than one witness who <126 of
the <104 <134 they were accused, and also of the <9 <44 were
to come, <53 to the spirit of prophecy <11 was in them.

10:13 <444 <41 were some among them who thought to question
them, that by their cunning devices they might catch them in <8
words, that they <9 find <64 <439 <20 that they <7
deliver them to <17 judges that they <9 be judged <60 to the
law, and that they <11 be slain or cast into prison, <15 to the
crime <74 they could make appear or <43 <43 <79

10:14 Now it was those men who sought to destroy <57 who were
lawyers, who were hired or appointed by the <147 to administer the
law at <68 times of trials, or at the trials of the crimes of the
<21 before the <503

10:15 Now <180 lawyers were learned in all the arts and <124 of the
people; and this was to enable them that they <98 be skilful in <49
profession.

10:16 And it came to pass that they <216 to <163 Amulek, that
thereby they <26 make him cross his <159 or contradict the <236
<123 he should speak.

10:17 Now they knew not that <255 <135 know of <50 designs. But it
came to pass as they <46 to <46 him, he perceived <16
thoughts, and he said unto them: O ye wicked and perverse generation,
ye <107 and hypocrites, for ye are laying the foundation of the
devil; for ye are <10 traps and snares to <240 the holy ones of
God.

10:18 Ye are <18 plans to pervert the ways of the righteous, and to
bring down the wrath of God upon your heads, even to the utter
destruction of this people.

10:19 Yea, well did Mosiah say, who was our last king, when he was
about to <286 up the kingdom, having no one to confer it upon,
causing that this <216 <147 be governed by <120 own voices—yea,
well did he say that if the time <16 come that the voice of this
<25 <9 choose iniquity, that is, if the time <8 come that
this <14 <6 fall into transgression, they would be ripe for
destruction.

10:20 And now I say unto you that well doth the Lord judge of your
iniquities; well doth he cry unto this people, by the <59 of his
angels: Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

10:21 Yea, well doth he cry, by the <27 of his angels that: I will
come down <450 my <42 with equity and justice in my hands.

10:22 Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers of
the <205 who are now in the land, that ye <112 even now be
visited with <205 destruction; yet it <11 not be by flood, as were
the <138 in the days of Noah, but it <17 be by famine, and by
pestilence, and the sword.

10:23 But it is by the <61 of the righteous that ye are spared; now
therefore, if ye will cast out the <14 from <107 you then will
not the Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he will come out
<509 you; then ye shall be smitten by <65 and by <64 and
by the sword; and the time is soon at hand except ye repent.

10:24 And now it came to pass that the <107 were more angry with
<454 and they cried out, saying: This man doth revile <55 our
laws <452 are just, and our wise <409 whom we have selected.

10:25 But <455 stretched forth his hand, and <33 the mightier unto
them, <37 O ye <440 and <440 <440 why hath Satan got
such great hold upon your hearts? Why will ye yield yourselves unto him
that he may have power over you, to blind your eyes, that ye will not
understand the words <73 are spoken, according to <377 truth?

10:26 For behold, have I testified <93 your law? Ye do not
understand; ye say that I have spoken <14 your law; but I have not,
but I have <12 in favor of your law, to your condemnation.

10:27 And now <44 I say unto you, that the foundation of the
<483 of this <163 is beginning to be laid by the
unrighteousness of your <149 and your judges.

10:28 And now it came to pass that when <155 had <59 these <103
the <35 <157 out <78 him, <155 Now we know that this man is
a child of the devil, for he hath lied unto us; for he hath <33
<27 our law. And now he says that he has not <13 <12 it.

10:29 And again, he has reviled <11 our lawyers, and our <78

10:30 And it came to pass that the <93 put it into <174 hearts
that they should remember <85 things <30 him.

10:31 And there was one <351 them whose name was Zeezrom. Now he was
the foremost to accuse <114 and Alma, he being one of the most expert
<25 <270 having much business to do <7 the people.

10:32 Now the object of <55 <67 was to get gain; and they got
gain <249 to <75 employ.

Alma Chapter 11

11:1 Now it was in the law of Mosiah that every man who was a judge of
the law, or those who were appointed to be judges, <109 receive wages
<45 to the time <301 they labored to <25 <20 who were
brought before them to be judged.

11:2 Now if a man owed another, and he would not pay that <31 he did
owe, he was complained of to the judge; and the <41 executed
authority, and sent <407 officers that the man <64 be <49
<50 him; and he judged the man <71 to the law and the
evidences <44 were <19 <191 him, and thus the man was
compelled to pay that <15 he owed, or be stripped, or be cast out
from <173 the <300 as a thief and a robber.

11:3 And the <72 received for his <127 <55 to his time—a
senine of gold for a day, or a senum of silver, <48 is equal to a
<17 of gold; and this is <28 to the law <16 was given.

11:4 Now <222 are the names of the different pieces of <218 gold, and
of <5 <40 <28 to <4 value. And the <19 are given by
the Nephites, for they did not reckon after the manner of the Jews who
were at Jerusalem; neither did they measure <15 the <15 of the
Jews; but they altered <41 reckoning and <3 measure, <48 to
the minds and the circumstances of the people, in <264 generation,
until the reign of the <255 they <324 been established by king
Mosiah.

11:5 Now the <39 is thus—a <120 of <94 a seon of <4 a shum
of <5 and a limnah of gold.

11:6 A <151 of <111 an amnor of <4 an ezrom of <4 and an
onti of silver.

11:7 A <22 of silver was <172 to a <51 of <42 and either for a
<113 of barley, and also for a <7 of <94 kind of grain.

11:8 Now the amount of a seon of gold was twice the value of a senine.

11:9 And a shum of gold was <16 the <16 of a seon.

11:10 And a <99 of gold was the <15 of them all.

11:11 And an <102 of <84 was as great as two senums.

11:12 And an <113 of <15 was as <15 as four <15

11:13 And an onti was as <13 as them all.

11:14 Now this is the <55 of the lesser numbers of <219 reckoning—

11:15 A shiblon is half of a senum; therefore, a <8 for half a
<133 of barley.

11:16 And a shiblum is a half of a shiblon.

11:17 And a leah is the half of a shiblum.

11:18 Now this is <56 number, <275 to <4 reckoning.

11:19 Now an antion of gold is <203 to three shiblons.

11:20 Now, it was for the sole purpose to get gain, because they
<418 <34 <417 <38 to <4 employ, <87 they did
stir up the <446 to riotings, and all <342 of disturbances and
wickedness, that they might have more <24 that they <6 get money
<34 to the suits <423 were <502 before them; therefore they
did stir up the <39 <512 Alma and Amulek.

11:21 And this Zeezrom began to question Amulek, saying: Will ye answer
me a few questions <37 I shall ask you? Now <20 was a man who was
expert in the devices of the devil, that he <67 destroy that <25
was good; <100 he said unto Amulek: Will ye <42 the <39
<15 I <40 put unto you?

11:22 And Amulek said unto him: Yea, if it be <100 to the Spirit
of the Lord, <27 is in me; for I <31 say nothing <9 is contrary
to the <20 of the Lord. And <81 said unto him: Behold, here are
six onties of <416 and all these will I give thee if thou wilt deny
the existence of a Supreme Being.

11:23 Now <71 said: O thou child of hell, why tempt ye me? Knowest
thou that the righteous yieldeth to no such temptations?

11:24 Believest thou that there is no God? I say unto you, Nay, thou
knowest that <13 is a God, but thou lovest that lucre more than him.

11:25 And now thou hast lied <219 God unto me. Thou saidst unto
me—Behold <93 six onties, <121 are of <389 worth, I will give unto
thee—when thou hadst it in thy heart to retain them from me; and it was
only thy desire that I should deny the true and living God, that thou
mightest have cause to <219 me. And now behold, for this <49 evil
thou shalt have thy reward.

11:26 And <175 said unto him: Thou sayest <104 is a true and <40
God?

11:27 And <159 <159 Yea, <16 is a true and <16 God.

11:28 Now <34 <15 Is <15 more than one God?

11:29 And he answered, No.

11:30 Now <21 said unto him again: How <161 thou <131 things?

11:31 And he <36 An angel hath made them known unto me.

11:32 And <30 said <28 Who is he that <281 come? Is it the Son
of God?

11:33 And he said unto him, Yea.

11:34 And <31 said <31 Shall he save his <410 in <460 sins?
And <110 answered and said unto him: I say unto you he <48 not, for
it is impossible for him to deny his word.

11:35 Now <42 said unto the people: See that ye remember <104
things; for he said <136 is but one God; yet he saith that the Son of
God <47 come, but he <4 not save his people—as though he had
authority to command God.

11:36 Now <80 <30 again unto him: Behold thou hast lied, for thou
<216 that I spake as <30 I had <29 to <29 God because I
said he <47 not save his <119 in <119 sins.

11:37 And I say unto you <44 that he cannot save them in <18 sins;
for I <9 deny his word, and he hath said that no unclean thing can
inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore, how can ye be saved, except
ye <14 the <14 of heaven? Therefore, ye <35 be saved in your
<63

11:38 Now <156 <105 <61 unto him: Is the Son of God the very
Eternal Father?

11:39 And <125 said unto him: Yea, he is the very <16 Father of
heaven and of earth, and all things <419 in them are; he is the
beginning and the end, the first and the last;

11:40 And he <139 come into the world to redeem his people; and he
<12 take upon him the transgressions of those who believe on his
name; and <237 are they that <19 have eternal life, and salvation
cometh to none else.

11:41 Therefore the wicked remain as <202 <256 had been no
redemption made, <144 it be the loosing of the bands of death; for
<464 the day <36 that all <46 rise from the dead and stand
before God, and be judged according to <207 works.

11:42 Now, <47 is a death <126 is called a temporal <40 and the
<10 of Christ <38 loose the <52 of this <14 death, that all
<11 be raised from this <10 death.

11:43 The spirit and the body <16 be reunited <206 in its perfect
form; both limb and joint <13 be restored to its proper frame, even
as we now are at this time; and we <18 be brought to <94 <93
God, knowing even as we know now, and have a bright recollection of all
our guilt.

11:44 Now, this restoration <31 come to all, both old and young, both
bond and free, both male and female, both the <175 and the righteous;
and even <131 <27 not so much as a hair of <147 heads be lost; but
every <345 <16 be <92 to its <104 <92 as it is now, or in
the body, and <17 be <91 and be arraigned <92 the bar of
<161 the Son, and God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, <183 is one
<324 God, to be <205 <205 to <58 works, whether they be
good or <6 they be evil.

11:45 Now, <243 I have spoken unto you concerning the <210 of the
mortal <65 and also <10 the resurrection of the <9 body. I
say unto you that this <9 body is <219 to an immortal <24 that
is from <234 even from the <370 <39 unto <329 that they can die
no more; <74 spirits uniting with <4 bodies, never to be divided;
thus the whole becoming spiritual and immortal, that they can no more
see corruption.

11:46 Now, when <446 had finished <379 words the people began <266
to be astonished, and also <481 <9 to tremble. And thus ended the
<20 of Amulek, or this is all that I have written.

Alma Chapter 12

12:1 Now Alma, seeing that the <26 of <52 had silenced Zeezrom,
for he beheld that <9 had caught him in his lying and deceiving to
destroy him, and <28 that he <62 to tremble under a consciousness
of his guilt, he opened his mouth and <15 to speak unto him, and to
establish the <53 of <79 and to explain things beyond, or to
unfold the scriptures beyond that <236 <59 had done.

12:2 Now the <26 that Alma spake unto <119 were heard by the
<134 round about; for the multitude was great, and he <18 on this
wise:

12:3 Now <105 <86 that thou hast been taken in thy <102 and
craftiness, for thou hast not lied unto men only but thou hast lied
unto God; for <278 he knows all thy thoughts, and thou seest that
thy thoughts are made known unto us by his Spirit;

12:4 And thou <19 that we know that thy plan was a very subtle plan,
as to the subtlety of the devil, for to lie and to deceive this <103
that thou mightest set them against us, to revile us and to cast us
out—

12:5 Now this was a plan of thine adversary, and he hath exercised his
power in thee. Now I would that ye should remember that what I say unto
thee I say unto all.

12:6 And behold I say unto you all that this was a snare of the
<47 <201 he has laid to catch this people, that he might bring
you into subjection unto him, that he <10 encircle you about with his
chains, that he <10 chain you down to everlasting destruction,
<466 to the <82 of his captivity.

12:7 Now when Alma had <459 <371 words, <242 <284 to <299
more exceedingly, for he was convinced more and more of the <31 of
God; and he was also <14 that Alma and <284 had a knowledge of
him, for he was <14 that they knew the <218 and intents of
his heart; for <35 was given unto them that they <84 know of <63
<330 <82 to the spirit of prophecy.

12:8 And <75 <75 to inquire of them diligently, that he <26
know more concerning the kingdom of God. And he said unto Alma: What
does this mean <159 <76 hath <109 <19 the resurrection of
the dead, that all shall rise from the <7 both the just and the
unjust, and are brought to stand before God to be judged <74 to
their works?

12:9 And now Alma <74 to expound <92 <91 unto him, saying: It is
<108 unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless they are
laid <470 a strict command that they <65 not impart only <47
to the portion of his word <90 he doth grant unto the children of
men, <18 to the heed and diligence <16 they give unto him.

12:10 And therefore, he that will harden his heart, the same receiveth
the lesser <43 of the word; and he that will not <18 his <18
to him is <87 the greater <19 of the word, until it is <10 unto
him to know the <98 of God <13 he know them in full.

12:11 And they that will <41 <142 hearts, to them is <30 the
<60 <41 of the word <28 they know nothing <193 his
mysteries; and then they are taken captive by the <453 and led by his
will down to destruction. Now this is what is meant by the chains of
hell.

12:12 And <235 hath <235 plainly <43 death, and being raised
from this mortality to a state of immortality, and <12 <229 <227
the bar of God, to be <231 <166 to our works.

12:13 Then if our hearts have been hardened, yea, if we have hardened
our <11 against the <140 insomuch that it has not been found in us,
then will our <54 be awful, for then we <233 be condemned.

12:14 For our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will <7
us; we <22 not be <38 spotless; and our <400 will also <14
us; and in this awful <45 we <19 not dare to look up to our God;
and we would fain be glad if we could <296 the rocks and the
mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his presence.

12:15 But this cannot be; we must come forth and <372 <145 him in
his glory, and in his power, and in his might, majesty, and dominion,
and acknowledge to our everlasting shame that all his judgments are
just; that he is just in all his works, and that he is merciful unto
the <353 of men, and that he has all <509 to save every man that
believeth on his name and bringeth <71 fruit meet for repentance.

12:16 And now behold, I say unto you then cometh a <248 even a second
<5 <389 is a spiritual death; then is a time that whosoever dieth
in his sins, as to a temporal <21 <164 also die a <22 <22
yea, he <9 die as to <478 pertaining unto righteousness.

12:17 Then is the time when <362 torments <19 be as a lake of fire
and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever; and then is
the time that they <25 be chained down to an <151 destruction,
<312 to the <124 and captivity of Satan, he having subjected them
<13 to his will.

12:18 Then, I say unto you, they <36 be as though there had been no
redemption made; for they <224 be redeemed <30 to God’s
justice; and they <10 die, seeing <22 is no more corruption.

12:19 Now it came to pass that when Alma had made an end of speaking
these words, the people began to be more astonished;

12:20 But <38 was one Antionah, who was a chief ruler among them,
came <212 and said unto him: What is this that thou hast said, that
man should rise from the dead and be changed from this mortal to an
immortal <362 that the soul can never die?

12:21 What does the scripture mean, <233 saith that God placed
cherubim and a flaming sword on the east of the garden of Eden, lest
our first parents <55 enter and partake of the <287 of the tree of
life, and live forever? And thus we see that <104 was no possible
chance that they <29 live forever.

12:22 Now Alma said unto him: This is the thing <69 I was about to
explain, now we see that Adam did fall by the partaking of the
forbidden fruit, <198 to the word of God; and thus we see, that by
his fall, all mankind became a lost and fallen people.

12:23 And now <367 I say unto you that if it had been <82 for
Adam to have partaken of the <109 of the tree of life at that time,
<104 would have been no <367 and the word <8 have been void,
making God a liar, for he said: If thou eat thou shalt surely die.

12:24 And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the <6 <123
has been spoken of by Amulek, <8 is the <417 <411 nevertheless
<58 was a space granted unto man in <15 he might repent; therefore
this life <115 a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a
time to <8 for that endless <258 <28 has been <50 of by us,
<8 is after the resurrection of the dead.

12:25 Now, if it had not been for the plan of redemption, <23 was
laid from the foundation of the world, <77 could have been no
<35 of the dead; but <11 was a plan of <414 laid,
<29 <427 bring to pass the <19 of the dead, of <11 has
been spoken.

12:26 And now <205 if it were <199 that our <310 <310 <49
have gone <384 and <204 of the tree of life they <189 have been
forever miserable, <494 no preparatory <130 and thus the plan of
<63 <17 have been frustrated, and the word of God <9 have
been <216 taking none effect.

12:27 But <61 it was not so; but it was appointed unto men that
they must die; and <150 <250 they must come to judgment, even that
same judgment of <102 we have spoken, <4 is the end.

12:28 And <26 God had <38 that <507 things <383 come unto
man, <55 then he saw that it was expedient that man <15 know
concerning the <21 whereof he had <28 unto them;

12:29 Therefore he sent angels to converse with them, who caused men to
behold of his glory.

12:30 And they began from that time <156 to call on his name;
<282 God conversed with men, and made known unto them the plan of
<242 <96 had been prepared from the <242 of the world;
and this he made <23 unto them <443 to their faith and
repentance and <6 holy works.

12:31 Wherefore, he gave commandments unto men, they <203 <225
transgressed the <4 <10 as to <109 <50 were temporal,
and becoming as Gods, knowing good from evil, placing themselves in a
<341 to act, or being placed in a <8 to act <60 to <54
wills and pleasures, whether to do evil or to do good—

12:32 <146 God gave unto them commandments, <190 <64 made
<92 unto them the plan of <114 that they <181 not do <58
the penalty thereof <53 a second <239 <78 was an everlasting
<458 as to <87 pertaining unto righteousness; for on such the plan
of <300 <330 have no power, for the works of justice <9 not
be destroyed, <84 to the supreme goodness of God.

12:33 But God did call on men, in the name of his Son, (this <62 the
plan of <44 <64 was laid) saying: If ye will repent and harden
not your hearts, then will I have mercy upon you, through mine Only
Begotten Son;

12:34 Therefore, whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth not his heart, he
<445 have claim on <27 <25 mine Only <24 Son, unto a
remission of his sins; and <333 <19 enter into my rest.

12:35 And <38 will <63 his heart and will do iniquity, <346
I swear in my wrath that he <28 not <29 into my <29

12:36 And now, my brethren, <330 I say unto you, that if ye will
<40 your hearts ye <28 not <28 into the rest of the Lord;
<333 your iniquity provoketh him that he sendeth down his <51
upon you as in the <290 provocation, yea, <176 to his word in the
last provocation as well as the first, to the <223 destruction
of your souls; therefore, <23 to his word, unto the last <241
as well as the first.

12:37 And now, my <89 seeing we know <135 things, and they are
true, let us repent, and <93 not our <195 that we provoke not the
Lord our God to pull down his <86 upon us in <32 his <294
<376 <231 he has given unto us; but let us <122 into the rest
of God, <16 is <438 <81 to his word.

Alma Chapter 13

13:1 And again, my <77 I would cite your minds forward to the
time when the Lord God gave <57 <54 unto his children; and I
<22 that ye <370 remember that the Lord God ordained priests, <391
his holy order, <60 was <7 the order of his Son, to teach <34
<375 unto the people.

13:2 And those priests were <31 <23 the <23 of his Son, in a
manner that thereby the people might know in what <9 to look
<81 to his Son for redemption.

13:3 And this is the <18 <37 <63 they were ordained—being called
and <128 from the foundation of the world <134 to the
foreknowledge of God, on account of <506 exceeding faith and good
works; in the <260 place <411 left to choose good or evil; <286
they <503 chosen good, and exercising exceedingly great faith, are
<51 with a holy calling, yea, with that holy calling <65 was
<61 with, and <57 to, a preparatory <446 for such.

13:4 And thus they have been <32 to this holy <27 on <71 of
<72 <45 while others <179 reject the Spirit of God on <14 of
the hardness of <17 <370 and blindness of <5 minds, while, if it
had not been for this they <154 have had as <83 privilege as <19
brethren.

13:5 Or in fine, in the <116 <116 they were on the same standing with
<22 brethren; thus this holy <73 <130 <98 from the
<160 of the <160 for such as <77 not <344 <21 <343
<18 in and <510 the atonement of the Only Begotten Son, who was
prepared—

13:6 And thus <21 <118 by this holy <150 and <250 unto the
high priesthood of the holy <256 of God, to <278 his <312
unto the children of men, that they also <106 <367 into his rest—

13:7 This high <31 <44 <250 the <31 of his Son, <190 <5
was from the <91 of the world; or in other words, <21 without
beginning of days or end of years, <10 <114 from eternity to all
eternity, <216 to his <272 of all things—

13:8 Now they were <90 <53 this manner—being <100 with a holy
<101 and <11 with a holy ordinance, and taking upon them the
high <77 of the holy <392 <74 <20 and <16 and
high priesthood, is <68 <67 or end—

13:9 Thus they become high <391 forever, <50 the <98 of the Son,
the Only <169 of the Father, who is <29 <29 of days or
end of <97 who is full of grace, equity, and truth. And thus it is.
Amen.

13:10 Now, as I said concerning the holy <73 or this high
<70 there were many who were <100 and became high <66
of God; and it was on <317 of <246 <402 <402 and repentance,
and <7 righteousness before God, they choosing to repent and work
<10 rather than to perish;

13:11 Therefore they were <151 <105 this holy <59 and were
sanctified, and <33 garments were washed white <285 the blood of
the Lamb.

13:12 Now they, <27 <206 sanctified by the Holy Ghost, <446 <26
<27 made white, <12 pure and spotless <66 God, could not look
upon sin save it were with abhorrence; and <108 were many, <468
<386 <4 who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord
<43 God.

13:13 And now, my brethren, I <369 that ye should humble yourselves
<52 God, and bring forth fruit meet for <131 that ye may also
<330 into that rest.

13:14 Yea, <26 <26 even as the people in the days of
Melchizedek, who was also a high priest <110 this same <243 <269 I
have spoken, who also took upon him the high <286 forever.

13:15 And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid tithes;
yea, even our father <8 paid tithes of one-tenth part of all he
possessed.

13:16 Now these ordinances were given <58 this manner, that thereby
the <78 <424 look forward on the Son of God, it <172 a type of his
<215 or it <9 his <5 and this that they <25 look <25 to
him for a remission of <160 sins, that they <14 <133 into the rest
of the Lord.

13:17 Now this <93 was a king over the land of Salem; and his
<67 had waxed strong in iniquity and abomination; yea, they had all
gone astray; they were full of all manner of wickedness;

13:18 But <40 <264 exercised mighty faith, and received the
office of the high <157 <481 to the holy <175 of God, did
preach repentance unto his people. And behold, they did repent; and
<35 did establish peace in the land in his days; therefore he
was <347 the prince of peace, for he was the king of <92 and he
did reign under his father.

13:19 Now, <313 were many <278 him, and also <7 were many
afterwards, but none were greater; therefore, of him they have more
particularly made mention.

13:20 Now I need not rehearse the matter; what I have said may suffice.
Behold, the scriptures are <45 you; if ye will wrest them it shall
be to your own destruction.

13:21 And now it came to pass that when Alma had said <258 words unto
them, he stretched <356 his hand unto them and cried with a <165
voice, saying: Now is the time to repent, for the day of salvation
draweth nigh;

13:22 Yea, and the voice of the Lord, by the mouth of angels, doth
declare it unto all nations; yea, doth <7 it, that they may have
glad tidings of <455 joy; yea, and he doth sound <76 glad <11
among all his people, yea, even to them that are scattered abroad upon
the face of the earth; wherefore they have come unto us.

13:23 And they are made known unto us in plain terms, that we may
understand, that we cannot err; and this because of our <361 wanderers
in a strange land; <202 we are thus highly favored, for we have
<74 glad <74 declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard.

13:24 For <290 angels are declaring it unto many at this time in our
<41 and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of the
children of men to receive his word at the time of his coming in his
glory.

13:25 And now we only wait to hear the joyful news <72 unto us by
the <184 of <184 of his coming; for the time cometh, we know not
how soon. Would to God that it <459 be in my day; but let it be sooner
or later, in it I will rejoice.

13:26 And it <298 be made <166 unto just and holy men, by the <56
of <57 at the time of his coming, that the <298 of our fathers may
be fulfilled, <445 to that which they have spoken concerning him,
<7 was <12 to the spirit of prophecy <8 was in them.

13:27 And now, my brethren, I wish from the inmost part of my heart,
yea, with <280 anxiety even unto pain, that ye would hearken unto my
words, and cast off your sins, and not procrastinate the day of your
repentance;

13:28 But that ye <27 humble yourselves <416 the <344 and call on
his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be
tempted above that <85 ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy
Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love and
all long-suffering;

13:29 Having faith on the Lord; having a hope that ye <173 <252
eternal life; <10 the love of God always in your hearts, that ye may
be lifted up at the last day and enter into his rest.

13:30 And may the Lord grant unto you repentance, that ye may not bring
down his wrath upon you, that ye may not be bound down by the chains of
hell, that ye may not suffer the second death.

13:31 And Alma spake many more <233 unto the <452 <126 are not
written in this book.

Alma Chapter 14

14:1 And it came to pass after he had made an end of speaking unto the
people many of them did believe on his <217 and began to repent, and
to search the scriptures.

14:2 But the more part of them were desirous that they <351 destroy
Alma and Amulek; for they were angry with Alma, <485 of the
plainness of his <90 unto Zeezrom; and they also said that Amulek had
lied unto them, and had reviled against their law and also <5
<6 lawyers and judges.

14:3 And they were also <46 with Alma and <54 and <49 they
had testified so plainly <27 <26 wickedness, they sought to put
them away privily.

14:4 But it came to pass that they did not; but they took them and
<194 them with strong cords, and took them <323 the chief judge of
the land.

14:5 And the <153 went forth and witnessed <57 them—testifying
that they had <96 <7 the law, and <67 <93 and judges of
the land, and also of all the <29 that were in the land; and also
<93 that there was but one God, and that he should send his Son
among the <243 but he <10 not save them; and many such things did
the <40 testify <59 Alma and Amulek. Now this was done <93
the <94 <94 of the <93

14:6 And it came to pass that Zeezrom was astonished at the <203 <290
had been spoken; and he also knew concerning the blindness of the
minds, <16 he had caused <70 the <56 by his lying words; and his
soul <277 to be harrowed up under a consciousness of his own guilt;
yea, he <15 to be encircled about by the pains of hell.

14:7 And it came to pass that he <21 to cry unto the <120 saying:
Behold, I am guilty, and these men are spotless <108 God. And he
<22 to plead for them from that time forth; but they <192 him,
<30 Art thou also possessed with the devil? And they spit upon him,
and cast him out from <102 <314 and also all those who believed in
the <134 <118 had been spoken by Alma and <305 and they cast them
out, and sent men to cast stones at them.

14:8 And they brought <250 wives and children together, and whosoever
<42 or had been taught to <428 in the word of God they <165
that they <233 be cast into the fire, and they also <35 <299
<37 records <68 contained the holy scriptures, and cast them into
the fire also, that they <440 be burned and destroyed by fire.

14:9 And it came to pass that they took Alma and Amulek, and carried
them <45 to the place of martyrdom, that they <34 witness the
destruction of <130 who were consumed by <39

14:10 And when <465 saw the <219 of the women and <111 who were
consuming in the <91 he also was pained; and he said unto Alma: How
can we <46 this awful scene? Therefore let us stretch <63 our
hands, and exercise the power of God <114 is in us, and save them from
the flames.

14:11 But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must
not <40 <40 mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth them up unto
himself, in glory; and he doth suffer that they may do this thing, or
that the <353 may do this thing unto <258 according to the hardness
of <188 hearts, that the judgments <77 he shall <85 upon them
in his wrath may be just; and the blood of the innocent <17 stand as
a <119 <450 <38 yea, and cry mightily <6 them at the last
day.

14:12 Now <167 said unto <146 <365 perhaps they will burn us
also.

14:13 And Alma said: Be it <75 to the will of the Lord. But,
behold, our work is not finished; therefore they burn us not.

14:14 Now it came to pass that when the bodies of <234 who had been
cast into the fire were consumed, and also the <304 <113 were cast
in with <93 the chief judge of the land came and stood <438 Alma
and <288 as they were bound; and he smote them with his hand upon
<152 cheeks, and said unto them: After what ye have seen, will ye
preach again unto this <486 that they <149 be cast into a lake of
fire and brimstone?

14:15 <136 ye see that ye had not <270 to save <95 who had been
cast into the fire; neither has God saved them because they were of thy
faith. And the <94 <77 them <57 upon <74 <74 and asked:
What say ye for yourselves?

14:16 Now this <21 was after the order and faith of Nehor, who slew
Gideon.

14:17 And it came to pass that Alma and <219 answered him nothing;
and he <52 them again, and delivered them to the officers to be cast
into prison.

14:18 And when they had been cast into prison three days, there came
many lawyers, and judges, and priests, and teachers, who were of the
profession of Nehor; and they came in unto the <28 to see <207 and
they questioned them about many words; but they <74 them nothing.

14:19 And it came to pass that the <114 <224 <224 <28 and <295
Why do ye not answer the words of this people? Know ye not that I have
<185 to deliver you up unto the flames? And he commanded them to
speak; but they <55 <54

14:20 And it came to pass that they departed and went <187 ways, but
came <194 on the morrow; and the <68 also <152 them <10 on <17
cheeks. And many came <478 also, and <13 <81 saying: Will ye <419
<18 and <24 this <280 and condemn our law? If ye have such great
<81 why do ye not <84 <232

14:21 And many such things did they say unto <40 gnashing <52 teeth
upon <6 and spitting upon <4 and <51 How <321 we look when
we are damned?

14:22 And many such things, yea, all manner of such <40 did they say
unto them; and thus they did mock them for many days. And they did
withhold food from them that they might hunger, and water that they
<7 thirst; and they also did take from them <75 clothes that they
were naked; and thus they were bound with strong cords, and confined in
<288

14:23 And it came to pass <342 they had thus suffered for many <291
(and it was on the twelfth day, in the tenth month, in the <4 year
of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi) that the <498
<178 over the land of Ammonihah and many of <78 teachers and <3
lawyers went in unto the <317 where Alma and <382 were <83 with
cords.

14:24 And the <37 <36 <306 <306 <175 and <228 them <393 and
said unto them: If ye have the <218 of God <216 yourselves from
these bands, and then we will believe that the Lord will destroy this
<81 according to your words.

14:25 And it came to pass that they all went <282 and <53 <56
saying the same words, even until the last; and when the last had
spoken unto them the <62 of God was upon Alma and Amulek, and they
rose and <91 upon <118 feet.

14:26 And Alma cried, <273 How long <274 we suffer <85 <313
afflictions, O Lord? O Lord, give us strength <81 to our faith
which is in Christ, even unto deliverance. And they broke the cords
with <14 they were bound; and when the <108 saw this, they began to
flee, for the fear of destruction had come upon them.

14:27 And it came to pass that so <64 was <82 fear that they fell
to the earth, and did not obtain the outer door of the prison; and the
earth shook mightily, and the walls of the <223 were rent in twain,
so that they fell to the earth; and the <222 judge, and the lawyers,
and priests, and teachers, who <174 upon Alma and <150 were slain
by the fall thereof.

14:28 And Alma and <264 came <197 out of the prison, and they were
not hurt; for the Lord had granted unto them power, <152 to <98
<153 <138 was in Christ. And they straightway came <32 out of the
<96 and they were loosed from <22 bands; and the <94 had
fallen to the <122 and every soul within the <109 thereof, save it
were Alma and <84 was slain; and they <42 came <42 into
the city.

14:29 Now the <192 having heard a <168 noise came running together
by multitudes to know the cause of it; and when they saw Alma and
<112 coming <38 out of the <112 and the <60 thereof had <72
to the <73 they were struck with <42 fear, and fled from the
presence of Alma and <32 even as a goat fleeth with her young from
two lions; and thus they did flee from the <24 of Alma and Amulek.

Alma Chapter 15

15:1 And it came to pass that Alma and <43 were commanded to depart
out of that city; and they departed, and came out even into the land of
Sidom; and behold, there they found all the <130 who had departed out
of the land of Ammonihah, who had been cast out and stoned, because
they believed in the words of Alma.

15:2 And they related unto them all that had happened unto <213 wives
and children, and also concerning themselves, and of <11 <442 of
<393

15:3 And also Zeezrom lay sick at Sidom, with a burning fever, <263
was caused by the <162 tribulations of his mind on account of his
wickedness, for he supposed that Alma and <125 were no more; and he
<11 that they had been <337 <90 of his iniquity. And this
<37 sin, and his many other sins, did harrow up his mind until it did
become exceedingly sore, <263 no deliverance; therefore he <457 to
be scorched with a <76 heat.

15:4 Now, when he <283 that Alma and <64 were in the land of <98
his heart <30 to take courage; and he sent a message immediately unto
them, desiring them to come unto him.

15:5 And it came to pass that they went immediately, obeying the
<27 <133 he had sent unto them; and they went in unto the house
unto Zeezrom; and they <226 him upon his bed, sick, being very low
with a <89 fever; and his mind also was <110 sore <136 of
his iniquities; and when he saw them he stretched <359 his hand, and
besought them that they would heal him.

15:6 And it came to pass that Alma said unto him, taking him by the
hand: Believest thou in the <239 of Christ unto salvation?

15:7 And he answered and said: Yea, I believe all the <287 that thou
hast taught.

15:8 And Alma <18 If thou believest in the redemption of <37 thou
canst be healed.

15:9 And he <20 Yea, I <38 according to thy words.

15:10 And then Alma cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord our God, have
mercy on this man, and heal him <29 to his faith <175 is in
Christ.

15:11 And when Alma had said these words, <333 leaped upon his feet,
and <234 to walk; and this was done to the <297 astonishment of all
the people; and the knowledge of this went <169 throughout all the
land of Sidom.

15:12 And Alma baptized <44 unto the Lord; and he <43 from that
time <26 to preach unto the people.

15:13 And Alma established a church in the land of <305 and
consecrated priests and teachers in the land, to baptize unto the Lord
whosoever were desirous to be baptized.

15:14 And it came to pass that they were many; for they did flock in
from all the region round about <47 and were <29

15:15 But as to the people that were in the land of Ammonihah, they yet
remained a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked <128 and they repented not
of <501 <433 ascribing all the <266 of Alma and <403 to the devil;
for they were of the profession of Nehor, and did not <232 in the
repentance of <31 sins.

15:16 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek, <37 <466 forsaken
all his gold, and silver, and his precious things, <232 were in the
land of <83 for the word of God, he <397 rejected by those who
were once his friends and also by his father and his kindred;

15:17 Therefore, after Alma <51 <189 the <189 at <139
seeing a <248 check, yea, <5 that the <137 were checked as to
the pride of <91 hearts, and <232 to humble themselves before God,
and <8 to assemble <8 together at <17 sanctuaries to
worship God <16 the altar, watching and praying continually, that
they might be delivered from Satan, and from death, and from
destruction—

15:18 Now as I said, Alma <78 seen all <338 <122 therefore he
took <139 and came over to the land of Zarahemla, and took him to his
own house, and did administer unto him in his tribulations, and
strengthened him in the Lord.

15:19 And thus ended the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the
<123 of Nephi.

Alma Chapter 16

16:1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the <31 of the
<32 over the <31 of Nephi, on the fifth day of the second month,
there <104 been much peace in the land of <95 <10 <10
been no wars nor contentions for a certain number of years, even until
the <35 day of the <35 month in the <59 year, <28 was a cry
of war heard <452 the land.

16:2 For behold, the armies of the Lamanites had come in upon the
wilderness side, into the borders of the <426 even into the city of
<293 and <228 to slay the <98 and destroy the city.

16:3 And now it came to pass, <235 the Nephites could raise a
sufficient army to drive them out of the <43 they had destroyed the
<36 who were in the city of <49 and also some around the
<66 of Noah, and taken others captive into the wilderness.

16:4 Now it came to pass that the <54 were <503 to obtain
<366 who had been carried away <27 into the <27

16:5 <361 he that had been appointed chief captain over the
<132 of the Nephites, (and his name was Zoram, and he had two sons,
Lehi and Aha)—now Zoram and his two <9 knowing that Alma was high
priest over the church, and <211 <178 that he had the spirit of
prophecy, <330 they went unto him and desired of him to know
whither the Lord would that they should go into the <188 in
search of <399 brethren, who had been <124 <96 by the Lamanites.

16:6 And it came to pass that Alma inquired of the Lord concerning the
matter. And Alma returned and said unto them: Behold, the <238
will cross the river Sidon in the south wilderness, away up beyond the
<177 of the land of Manti. And behold <283 shall ye meet them, on
the east of the <30 Sidon, and <14 the Lord will deliver unto thee
thy brethren who have been <84 <84 by the <84

16:7 And it came to pass that <157 and his sons crossed over the <38
<39 with <115 armies, and marched away <69 the <68 of Manti
into the <81 <81 which was on the east side of the <27
Sidon.

16:8 And they came upon the <221 of the Lamanites, and the <118
were scattered and driven into the wilderness; and they took <53
<85 who had been <85 <85 by the <25 and <104 was not
one soul of them had been lost that were <19 captive. And they were
brought by <33 <32 to possess <4 own lands.

16:9 And thus ended the <439 year of the judges, the <66
<261 been <65 out of the <373 and the <370 of Ammonihah were
destroyed; yea, every living soul of the Ammonihahites was destroyed,
and also <46 great city, <124 they said God <413 not destroy,
because of its greatness.

16:10 But <476 in one day it was left desolate; and the carcasses
were mangled by dogs and wild beasts of the <379

16:11 Nevertheless, after many days <50 dead bodies were heaped up
upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow
covering. And now so <74 was the scent thereof that the <100 did
not go in to <136 the land of <109 for many years. And it was
called Desolation of Nehors; for they were of the profession of Nehor,
who were slain; and <68 lands remained desolate.

16:12 And the <157 did not come again to war against the <490
until the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the <69 of
Nephi. And thus for three years did the <11 of Nephi have continual
peace in all the land.

16:13 And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the <25
in <72 temples, and in <4 sanctuaries, and also in <5
synagogues, <199 were built <158 the manner of the Jews.

16:14 And as many as <482 hear <22 words, unto them they did impart
the word of God, without any respect of persons, continually.

16:15 And thus did Alma and <68 go forth, and also many more who had
been chosen for the work, to preach the word throughout all the <98
And the establishment of the church became general <13 the <303
in all the region round about, among all the <106 of the Nephites.

16:16 And <373 was no inequality <16 them; the Lord did pour out his
Spirit on all the face of the land to prepare the minds of the children
of men, or to <11 <115 hearts to receive the word <140 should be
taught <41 them at the time of his coming—

16:17 That they might not be hardened <230 the word, that they <9
not be unbelieving, and go on to destruction, but that they <13
<46 the word with joy, and as a branch be grafted into the true
vine, that they <20 enter into the rest of the Lord <75 God.

16:18 Now those priests who did go <241 <77 the <133 did <164
<65 all lyings, and deceivings, and envyings, and strifes, and
malice, and revilings, and stealing, robbing, plundering, murdering,
committing adultery, and all <247 of lasciviousness, crying that
these things ought not so to be—

16:19 Holding <49 <12 <132 must shortly come; yea, holding <8
the coming of the Son of God, his sufferings and death, and also the
resurrection of the dead.

16:20 And many of the <83 did inquire concerning the place where the
Son of God <178 <45 and they were <180 that he <310 appear unto
them <329 his resurrection; and this the <31 did hear with <469
joy and gladness.

16:21 And now <21 the <280 had been established <281 all the
land—having got the victory over the devil, and the word of God being
preached in its purity in all the <304 and the Lord pouring out his
blessings upon the people—thus ended the <459 year of the <459
of the <460 over the <71 of <459

Alma Chapter 17

17:1 And now it came to pass that as Alma was journeying from the land
of Gideon southward, away to the land of Manti, behold, to his
astonishment, he met with the sons of Mosiah <26 towards the
land of Zarahemla.

17:2 Now <212 sons of <16 were with Alma at the time the angel
first appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see
his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were still his
brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in the knowledge
of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had
searched the scriptures diligently, that they <343 know the word of
God.

17:3 But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and
fasting; <83 they had the spirit of prophecy, and the <5 of
revelation, and when they taught, they <264 with power and authority
of God.

17:4 And they had been teaching the word of God for the space of
fourteen years <394 the Lamanites, having had much success in bringing
many to the <108 of the <107 yea, by the <46 of <429 words
many were brought before the altar of God, to call on his name and
confess <19 sins <15 him.

17:5 Now <196 are the circumstances <398 attended them in <17
journeyings, for they had many afflictions; they did suffer much, both
in body and in mind, such as hunger, thirst and fatigue, and also much
labor in the spirit.

17:6 Now <46 were <40 journeyings: Having taken leave of <6
father, Mosiah, in the <243 year of the judges; <112 refused the
kingdom <66 <17 father was desirous to confer upon them, and also
this was the minds of the people;

17:7 Nevertheless they departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and took
<34 swords, and <3 spears, and <3 bows, and <3 arrows, and
<4 slings; and this they did that they <248 provide food for
<234 while in the wilderness.

17:8 And thus they <48 into the wilderness with <30 numbers
<81 they had selected, to go up to the land of Nephi, to preach the
word of God unto the Lamanites.

17:9 And it came to pass that they journeyed many days in the
wilderness, and they fasted much and prayed much that the Lord would
grant unto them a portion of his Spirit to go with <136 and abide with
<5 that they <96 be an instrument in the hands of God to bring, if
it were possible, <90 brethren, the <289 to the <281 of
the truth, to the <7 of the baseness of the traditions of <21
fathers, <111 were not correct.

17:10 And it came to pass that the Lord did visit them with his Spirit,
and said unto them: Be comforted. And they were <4

17:11 And the Lord said unto them also: Go forth <358 the <69
thy <74 and establish my word; yet ye shall be patient in
long-suffering and afflictions, that ye may show <25 good examples
unto them in me, and I will make an <120 of thee in my <122 unto
the salvation of many souls.

17:12 And it came to pass that the hearts of the sons of <317 and
also those who were with <163 took courage to go <55 unto the
Lamanites to declare unto them the word of God.

17:13 And it came to pass when they had arrived in the borders of the
land of the <112 that they separated <295 and <285 one
from another, trusting in the Lord that they should meet again at the
close of <188 harvest; for they supposed that great was the work <195
they had undertaken.

17:14 And assuredly it was great, for they had undertaken to <312 the
word of God to a wild and a hardened and a ferocious <403 a people
who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering
them; and <61 <140 were set upon riches, or upon gold and silver,
and precious stones; yet they sought to obtain <482 things by
<34 and plundering, that they <315 not <502 for them with <35
own hands.

17:15 Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship
idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the
<321 of <37 fathers; notwithstanding the promises of the Lord
were extended unto them on the conditions of repentance.

17:16 Therefore, this was the cause for <151 the sons of Mosiah had
<141 the work, that perhaps they <84 bring them unto
repentance; that <9 they <9 <9 them to know of the plan of
redemption.

17:17 Therefore they <222 <222 one from <219 and went
<268 <348 <275 every man alone, according to the word and power of
God <62 was given unto him.

17:18 Now Ammon being the chief <28 <28 or rather he did administer
unto <8 and he <268 from <5 after having blessed them
<43 to <126 several stations, <9 imparted the word of God
unto <19 or administered unto them before his departure; and thus
they took <24 <24 journeys throughout the land.

17:19 And <61 went to the land of Ishmael, the land <69 called
<54 the sons of <10 who also became Lamanites.

17:20 And as <27 entered the land of <16 the <384 took him
and bound him, as was <54 custom to bind all the Nephites who fell
into <11 hands, and carry them <78 the king; and thus it was left
to the pleasure of the king to slay <100 or to retain them in
captivity, or to cast them into prison, or to cast them out of his
land, <136 to his will and pleasure.

17:21 And thus <84 was carried <55 the king who was over the land
of Ishmael; and his name was Lamoni; and he was a descendant of
Ishmael.

17:22 And the king inquired of <36 if it were his desire to dwell in
the land <216 the <480 or <4 his people.

17:23 And <24 said unto him: Yea, I <25 to <25 <17 this <430
for a time; yea, and <302 until the day I die.

17:24 And it came to pass that king Lamoni was much pleased with Ammon,
and caused that his bands should be loosed; and he would that <54
<9 take one of his daughters to wife.

17:25 But <15 said unto him: Nay, but I will be thy servant.
<348 <13 <235 a servant to king Lamoni. And it came to pass
that he was set <90 other servants to watch the flocks of Lamoni,
<181 to the <239 of the <266

17:26 And <280 he had been in the service of the king three days, as
he was with the Lamanitish <39 going <399 with <261 <40 to
the place of water, <394 was <315 the water of Sebus, and all the
<300 drive <21 <21 hither, that they may have water—

17:27 <487 as <97 and the <42 of the king were driving
<47 <25 <25 to this <45 of <45 behold, a certain number of
the <214 who had been with <19 <19 to <16 stood and
scattered the <8 of <41 and the <41 of the king, and they
<14 them insomuch that they fled many ways.

17:28 Now the <21 of the king began to murmur, saying: Now the
king will slay us, as he has our brethren because <56 <48 were
<39 by the wickedness of these men. And they <30 to weep
exceedingly, <32 Behold, our <20 are <19 already.

17:29 Now they wept <33 of the fear of <464 slain. Now when <86
saw this his heart was swollen within him with joy; for, said he, I
will show <136 my power unto <55 my fellow-servants, or the <7
<184 is in me, in restoring <13 <57 unto the <120 that I may win
the hearts of <13 my <26 that I may lead them to believe
in my words.

17:30 And now, <20 were the thoughts of <340 when he saw the
afflictions of those whom he termed to be his brethren.

17:31 And it came to pass that he flattered them by his words, <129
My brethren, be of good cheer and let us go in search of the flocks,
and we will gather them together and bring them back unto the <248 of
water; and thus we will preserve the <109 unto the king and he will
not slay us.

17:32 And it came to pass that they went in <51 of the <51 and
they did follow <105 and they rushed <164 with much swiftness and
did head the <46 of the <155 and did <71 them <71 again to
the <69 of water.

17:33 And <131 men <14 <309 to scatter <260 flocks; but <222 said
unto his brethren: Encircle the <38 round about that they flee not;
and I go and contend with <175 men who do <30 our flocks.

17:34 <384 they did as <37 commanded them, and he went <82
and <52 to <28 with <59 who <6 by the waters of Sebus; and
they were in <391 not a few.

17:35 Therefore they did not fear <119 for they supposed that one of
<87 men could slay him <508 to <7 pleasure, for they knew not
that the Lord had promised Mosiah that he would deliver his sons out of
<22 hands; neither did they know anything concerning the Lord;
therefore they delighted in the destruction of <18 brethren; and for
this cause they <87 to <115 the <135 of the king.

17:36 But <115 <14 <111 and <406 to cast stones at them with his
sling; yea, with mighty <363 he did sling <14 amongst them; and
thus he slew a <511 <120 of them <482 that they <33 to be
astonished at his power; nevertheless they were angry <432 of the
slain of <76 <321 and they were determined that he should fall;
therefore, seeing that they <136 not hit him with <20 stones, they
came <78 with clubs to slay him.

17:37 But behold, every man that lifted his club to smite <176 he
smote off <30 arms with his sword; for he did withstand <9 blows
by smiting <5 arms with the edge of his sword, <93 that they
<94 to be astonished, and <5 to flee before him; yea, and they
were not few in number; and he caused them to flee by the strength of
his arm.

17:38 Now six of them had fallen by the sling, but he slew none save it
were <65 leader with his <79 and he <88 off as many of <12
arms as were <106 against him, and they were not a few.

17:39 And when he had driven them afar off, he returned and they
watered <32 <238 and <8 them to the pasture of the <417 and
then went in unto the <8 bearing the arms which had been smitten off
by the sword of <160 of <364 who sought to slay him; and they were
carried in unto the king for a testimony of the things <33 they had
done.

Alma Chapter 18

18:1 And it came to pass that king Lamoni <154 that his servants
<248 stand <233 and testify to all the <37 <37 they had seen
<357 the matter.

18:2 And when they had all testified to the <21 <21 they had seen,
and he had learned of the faithfulness of <354 in preserving his
flocks, and also of his great <348 in contending <166 <107 who
<108 to slay him, he was <337 exceedingly, and said: Surely,
this is more than a man. Behold, is not this the Great Spirit who doth
send such <38 punishments upon this people, <358 of <181 murders?

18:3 And they answered the <173 and <40 Whether he be the <31
<32 or a man, we know not; but this much we do know, that he cannot
be <393 by the enemies of the king; <490 can they <467 the
king’s <231 when he is with us, <59 of his expertness and <69
strength; <408 we know that he is a friend to the <490 And now,
O <70 we do not believe that a man has such <28 power, for we know
he <63 be slain.

18:4 And now, when the king heard these words, he said unto them: Now I
know that it is the <107 Spirit; and he has come down at this time to
preserve your lives, that I might not slay you as I did your brethren.
Now this is the <31 <137 of whom our fathers have spoken.

18:5 Now this was the tradition of Lamoni, <242 he had received from
his father, that there was a <31 Spirit. Notwithstanding they
believed in a <8 <39 they supposed that whatsoever they did was
right; nevertheless, <310 <480 to fear <240 with fear lest
he had done wrong in slaying his servants;

18:6 For he had <193 many of them <177 <235 brethren had scattered
<5 <190 at the place of water; and thus, <15 they had had
<14 <14 <18 they were <160

18:7 Now it was the practice of <160 Lamanites to <370 by the waters
of Sebus to <234 the <28 of the <289 that thereby they <149
drive away many that were <41 unto <45 own land, it being a
<38 of plunder among them.

18:8 And it came to pass that king <116 inquired of his servants,
saying: Where is this man that has such <246 power?

18:9 And they said unto him: <366 he is feeding thy horses. Now the
king had commanded his <34 previous to the time of the watering
of <71 <421 that they <472 prepare his horses and chariots, and
conduct him <480 to the land of Nephi; for <208 had been a <59
feast appointed at the land of Nephi, by the father of <235 who was
king over all the land.

18:10 Now when king <102 <316 that <482 was preparing his <54
and his chariots he was more astonished, <191 of the <500 of
Ammon, <119 Surely <58 has not been any servant <146 all my
servants that has been so faithful as this man; for even he doth
remember all my commandments to execute <169

18:11 Now I surely know that this is the <298 Spirit, and I would
desire him that he come in unto me, but I durst not.

18:12 And it came to pass that when <94 had made ready the <95 and
the <95 for the king and his <176 he went in unto the <462
and he saw that the countenance of the king was changed; therefore he
was about to return out of his presence.

18:13 And one of the king’s <116 said unto him, Rabbanah, <406 is,
<280 interpreted, powerful or <192 <46 considering <220 kings to
be powerful; and thus he said unto him: <23 the king desireth
thee to stay.

18:14 Therefore <94 turned himself unto the <32 and said unto him:
What wilt thou that I <257 do for thee, O king? And the king answered
him not for the space of an hour, according to <62 time, for he knew
not what he <30 say unto him.

18:15 And it came to pass that <60 said unto him again: What desirest
thou of me? But the king <49 him not.

18:16 And it came to pass that <256 <120 filled with the <512 of
God, <156 he perceived the thoughts of the king. And he said unto
him: Is it <287 thou hast <305 that I defended thy <160 and thy
<368 and slew seven of <92 <509 with the sling and with the
sword, and smote off the arms of others, in order to defend thy <483
and thy servants; behold, is it this that causeth thy marvelings?

18:17 I say unto you, what is it, that thy marvelings are so great?
<450 I am a man, and am thy servant; therefore, whatsoever thou
<129 <231 is right, that will I do.

18:18 Now when the king had <97 these words, he marveled again, for
he beheld that <163 could discern his thoughts; but notwithstanding
this, king <424 did open his mouth, and said unto him: Who art thou?
Art thou that <372 <372 who knows all things?

18:19 <36 <186 and said unto him: I am not.

18:20 And the king said: How knowest thou the <180 of my heart?
Thou mayest speak boldly, and tell me concerning <80 things; and also
tell me by what power ye slew and <166 off the arms of my <182
that scattered my flocks—

18:21 And now, if thou wilt tell me <37 <37 things, <140
thou <140 I will give unto thee; and if it were needed, I <466
guard thee with my armies; but I know that thou art more <391 than
all they; nevertheless, <35 thou <34 of me I will grant it
unto thee.

18:22 Now <125 <297 wise, yet harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt
thou hearken unto my <185 if I tell thee by what <104 I do <79
<157 And this is the thing that I desire of <43

18:23 And the king <169 him, and <157 Yea, I will believe all thy
words. And thus he was caught with guile.

18:24 And <69 began to <169 unto him with boldness, and said unto
him: Believest thou that there is a God?

18:25 And he answered, and said unto him: I do not know what that
meaneth.

18:26 And then <45 <67 <34 thou that <34 is a <257 Spirit?

18:27 And he said, Yea.

18:28 And <23 <23 This is God. And <6 said unto him <467
<33 thou that this <31 <288 who is God, created all things
<350 are in heaven and in the earth?

18:29 And he <38 Yea, I <127 that he <24 all <24 <23 are
in the earth; but I do not know the heavens.

18:30 And <60 said unto him: The heavens is a place where God dwells
and all his holy angels.

18:31 And king <378 <52 Is it above the <64

18:32 And <36 <12 Yea, and he looketh down upon all the children of
men; and he <387 all the <362 and intents of the heart; for by his
hand were they all <90 from the beginning.

18:33 And king <55 <43 I <106 all <262 <104 <104 thou hast
spoken. Art thou sent from God?

18:34 <64 said unto him: I am a man; and man in the beginning was
<46 after the image of God, and I am called by his Holy Spirit to
teach <48 <48 unto this people, that they may be brought to a
knowledge of that <62 is just and true;

18:35 And a portion of that <34 dwelleth in me, <18 giveth me
knowledge, and also <354 according to my faith and desires <14 are
in God.

18:36 Now when <91 had said <62 <383 he <330 at the creation of
the world, and also the <8 of Adam, and told him all the <83
<476 the fall of man, and rehearsed and laid before him the
records and the holy scriptures of the <102 <59 had been spoken by
the prophets, even down to the time that their father, Lehi, left
Jerusalem.

18:37 And he also <42 unto them (for it was unto the king and to
his servants) all the journeyings of <31 fathers in the wilderness,
and all <8 sufferings with hunger and thirst, and <7 travail, and
so forth.

18:38 And he also <46 unto them <97 the rebellions of
Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, yea, all <31 <14
did he relate unto them; and he expounded unto them all the <114 and
<113 from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem down to the present
time.

18:39 But this is not all; for he <33 unto them the plan of
redemption, <142 was prepared from the foundation of the world; and he
also made known unto them <83 the coming of Christ, and all the
works of the Lord did he make <19 unto them.

18:40 And it came to pass that <311 he had said all <238 things, and
<63 them to the king, that the king believed all his words.

18:41 And he <257 to cry unto the Lord, saying: O <3 have mercy;
<292 to thy abundant mercy <90 thou hast had upon the people of
Nephi, have upon me, and my people.

18:42 And now, when he had said this, he fell unto the earth, as if he
were dead.

18:43 And it came to pass that his servants took him and carried him in
unto his wife, and laid him upon a bed; and he lay as if he were dead
for the space of two days and two nights; and his <27 and his sons,
and his daughters mourned over him, <141 the manner of the Lamanites,
greatly lamenting his loss.

Alma Chapter 19

19:1 And it came to pass that <27 two days and two nights they were
about to take his body and lay it in a sepulchre, <144 they had made
for the purpose of burying <295 <118

19:2 Now the queen having heard of the fame of Ammon, therefore she
sent and desired that he should come in unto her.

19:3 And it came to pass that <473 did as he was commanded, and went
in unto the queen, and <32 to know what she would that he <37
do.

19:4 And she said unto him: The <179 of my husband have made it
<293 unto me that thou art a prophet of a holy God, and that thou hast
power to do many mighty <322 in his name;

19:5 Therefore, if this is the case, I <61 that ye <61 go in and
see my husband, for he has been laid upon his bed for the <217 of two
days and two <218 and some say that he is not dead, but others say
that he is dead and that he stinketh, and that he ought to be placed in
the sepulchre; but as for myself, to me he doth not stink.

19:6 Now, this was what <158 desired, for he knew that king Lamoni was
under the <110 of God; he knew that the dark veil of unbelief was
being cast away from his mind, and the light <241 did <3 up his
<10 <7 was the <8 of the glory of God, <9 was a marvelous
<11 of his goodness—yea, this <5 had infused such joy into his
soul, the cloud of darkness <261 been dispelled, and that the <19
of everlasting life was lit up in his <21 yea, he knew that this had
overcome his natural frame, and he was <402 away in God—

19:7 <197 what the <304 <260 of him was his only desire.
<12 he went in to see the king <488 as the <20 had
<22 him; and he saw the king, and he knew that he was not <348

19:8 And he said unto the queen: He is not <208 but he sleepeth in
God, and on the morrow he shall rise again; <362 bury him not.

19:9 And <190 said unto her: Believest thou this? And she said unto
him: I have had no witness save thy word, and the word of our servants;
nevertheless I believe that it <45 be <93 as thou hast said.

19:10 And <45 said unto her: Blessed art thou because of thy
exceeding faith; I say unto thee, woman, there has not been such great
faith among all the people of the Nephites.

19:11 And it came to pass that she watched over the bed of her <353
from that time even until that time on the <120 <247 <63 had
appointed that he <379 rise.

19:12 And it came to pass that he arose, <93 to the words of
Ammon; and as he <11 he stretched forth his hand unto the <84 and
said: <101 be the name of God, and blessed art thou.

19:13 For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have seen my Redeemer; and
he <146 come forth, and be born of a <41 and he <11 redeem all
mankind who <166 on his name. Now, when he had said these words, his
heart was swollen within him, and he sunk again with joy; and the <277
also sunk down, <392 overpowered by the Spirit.

19:14 Now <129 seeing the Spirit of the Lord poured out <118 to
his prayers upon the Lamanites, his brethren, who had been the cause of
so much mourning <195 the Nephites, or <4 all the <199 of God
<225 of their iniquities and <3 traditions, he fell upon his
knees, and began to pour out his soul in prayer and thanksgiving to God
for what he had done for his brethren; and he was also <88 with
joy; and thus they all three had sunk to the earth.

19:15 Now, when the servants of the king had seen that they had fallen,
they also <59 to cry unto God, for the fear of the Lord had come upon
them also, for it was they who had stood before the king and testified
unto him concerning the <316 power of Ammon.

19:16 And it came to pass that they did call on the name of the Lord,
in <127 might, even <311 they had all fallen to the earth, save it
were one of the Lamanitish women, whose name was Abish, she having been
converted unto the Lord for many years, on account of a remarkable
vision of her father—

19:17 Thus, <25 been <24 to the <58 and never <8 made it
known, therefore, when she saw that all the <142 of Lamoni had
<68 to the <68 and also her mistress, the queen, and the king,
and <262 lay prostrate upon the <17 she knew that it was the <126
of God; and supposing that this opportunity, by making known unto the
<253 what had happened <260 them, that by beholding this scene it
would <280 them to <347 in the <35 of God, therefore she ran
<412 from house to house, <37 it <38 unto the people.

19:18 And they <220 to assemble themselves together unto the <22 of
the king. And there came a multitude, and to <180 astonishment they
beheld the <99 and the <105 and <11 <122 <101 upon the
<102 and they all lay <28 as though they were dead; and they also
saw Ammon, and <454 he was a Nephite.

19:19 And now the <110 <67 to murmur <110 themselves; some saying
that it was a <265 evil that had come upon <124 or upon the king and
his <106 <387 he had suffered that the Nephite should remain in
the land.

19:20 But others rebuked <29 saying: The king hath brought this evil
upon his <32 <32 he slew his <99 who had had <104 flocks
scattered at the waters of Sebus.

19:21 And they were also <38 by those men who had <354 at the
<21 of Sebus and <28 the <32 which belonged to the <147
for they were angry with <250 <54 of the number <16 he had slain
of <56 brethren at the <33 of Sebus, while defending the <33 of
the <193

19:22 Now, one of <98 <354 brother had been <30 with the sword of
<171 being exceedingly <49 with <5 drew his <11 and went
<252 that he might let it fall upon <15 to slay him; and as he
lifted the <22 to smite him, <203 he fell dead.

19:23 Now we see that <90 could not be slain, for the Lord had said
unto Mosiah, his father: I will spare him, and it shall be unto him
according to thy faith—therefore, Mosiah trusted him unto the Lord.

19:24 And it came to pass that when the multitude <295 that the man
had <410 dead, who <76 the <76 to slay <89 fear came upon
them all, and they durst not put <109 <155 hands to touch him or any
of <201 who had fallen; and they <293 to marvel again <294
<363 what <98 be the <401 of this <295 power, or what all
these things <14 mean.

19:25 And it came to pass that <353 were many <33 them who said that
<134 was the Great Spirit, and <297 said he was sent by the <10
Spirit;

19:26 But <15 <274 them all, <355 that he was a monster, who
had been sent from the Nephites to torment them.

19:27 And <56 were some who said that <53 was sent by the <45
Spirit to afflict them <287 of <124 iniquities; and that it was the
<16 <15 that had always attended the Nephites, who had ever
delivered them out of <24 hands; and they said that it was this <25
<26 who had destroyed so many of <18 brethren, the Lamanites.

19:28 And thus the contention <163 to be <301 sharp <131 <85
And <335 they were thus contending, the woman servant who had caused
the <228 to be gathered together came, and when she saw the
<35 <374 was <32 the <17 she was <39 sorrowful,
even unto tears.

19:29 And it came to pass that she went and took the queen by the hand,
that perhaps she <356 raise her from the ground; and as soon as she
touched her hand she arose and <455 upon her feet, and cried with a
loud voice, <508 O blessed Jesus, who has saved me from an awful
hell! O <12 God, have mercy on this people!

19:30 And when she had said this, she clasped her hands, <434 filled
with joy, speaking many words <108 were not understood; and when she
had done <23 she took the <508 Lamoni, by the <95 and behold he
<79 and <79 upon his feet.

19:31 And he, immediately, seeing the <147 <145 his people, went
<366 and <189 to rebuke <503 and to teach them the <56 <56 he
had heard from the mouth of Ammon; and as many as <10 his <17
believed, and were converted unto the <442

19:32 But <302 were many <50 them who would not hear his words;
therefore they went <256 way.

19:33 And it came to pass that when <324 <92 he also administered
unto <72 and also did all the servants of Lamoni; and they did all
declare unto the people the selfsame thing—that <41 hearts had been
changed; that they had no more desire to do evil.

19:34 And behold, many did <30 unto the <30 that they had seen
angels and had conversed with them; and thus they had told them <471
of God, and of his righteousness.

19:35 And it came to pass that <118 were many that did believe in
<70 <117 and as many as did <10 were baptized; and they became
a righteous <187 and they did establish a church <146 <373

19:36 And thus the work of the Lord did commence <15 the Lamanites;
thus the Lord did begin to pour out his <425 upon <86 and we see
that his arm is extended to all <109 who will repent and <63 on
his name.

Alma Chapter 20

20:1 And it came to pass that when they had established a <74 in
that land, that king Lamoni desired that <204 should go with him to
the land of Nephi, that he <403 show him unto his father.

20:2 And the voice of the Lord came to <31 <393 Thou shalt not go
up to the land of <33 for <201 the king will seek thy life; but
thou <21 go to the land of Middoni; for <18 thy brother Aaron,
and also Muloki and Ammah are in prison.

20:3 Now it came to pass that when <56 had <337 <398 he said unto
Lamoni: Behold, my <33 and brethren are in prison at Middoni, and I
go that I may deliver <196

20:4 Now <123 said unto Ammon: I know, in the strength of the Lord
thou canst do all things. But <76 I will go with thee to the land
of <89 for the king of the land of <53 whose name is
Antiomno, is a friend unto me; <389 I go to the land of <18
that I may flatter the king of the <192 and he will cast thy <92
out of <121 Now <78 said unto him: Who told thee that thy
<16 were in prison?

20:5 And <130 said unto him: No one hath told me, save it be God; and
he said unto me—Go and <124 thy brethren, for they are in <141 in
the land of Middoni.

20:6 Now when <59 had <170 this he caused that his <456 <265
make ready his horses and his chariots.

20:7 And he said unto <160 Come, I will go with thee down to the land
of <120 and <412 I will plead with the king that he will cast thy
<103 out of <118

20:8 And it came to pass that as <109 and <71 were journeying
thither, they met the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land.

20:9 And <212 the <17 of <27 said unto him: Why did ye not
come to the feast on that great day when I made a <9 unto my sons,
and unto my people?

20:10 And he also said: Whither art thou going with this Nephite, who
is one of the children of a liar?

20:11 And it came to pass that <65 rehearsed unto him whither he was
going, for he feared to offend him.

20:12 And he also told him all the cause of his tarrying in his own
kingdom, that he did not go unto his <109 to the <89 which he had
prepared.

20:13 And now when <58 had <59 unto him all these things,
<136 to his astonishment, his <30 was angry with him, and <106
<162 thou art <107 to <268 <22 Nephites, who are sons of a
liar. <419 he robbed our fathers; and now his <117 are also come
amongst us that they may, by their cunning and <3 lyings, deceive
us, that they again may rob us of our property.

20:14 Now the <65 of <81 commanded him that he <298 slay <240
with the sword. And he also <14 him that he <14 not go to the
land of <290 but that he <12 return with him to the land of
Ishmael.

20:15 But <46 said unto him: I will not slay Ammon, neither will I
<27 to the land of Ishmael, but I go to the land of Middoni that I
may release the <327 of <27 for I know that they are just men
and holy prophets of the true God.

20:16 Now when his <107 had <407 <161 words, he was <177 with him,
and he drew his sword that he might smite him to the earth.

20:17 But <127 stood forth and said unto him: <185 thou shalt not
slay thy son; nevertheless, it were better that he <124 fall than
thee, for <233 he has repented of his sins; but if thou shouldst
fall at this time, in thine anger, thy soul could not be saved.

20:18 And again, it is expedient that thou <26 forbear; for if
thou <6 slay thy son, he being an innocent man, his blood would
cry from the ground to the Lord his God, for vengeance to come upon
thee; and perhaps thou wouldst lose thy soul.

20:19 Now when <111 had said <140 words unto him, he answered him,
saying: I know that if I <107 slay my son, that I <6 shed
<61 blood; for it is thou that hast sought to destroy him.

20:20 And he stretched <154 his hand to slay Ammon. But <52
withstood his blows, and also smote his arm that he <127 not use it.

20:21 Now when the king saw that <26 <15 slay him, he began to
plead with <10 that he <122 spare his life.

20:22 But <12 raised his sword, and said unto him: <212 I will
<233 thee except thou wilt grant unto me that my <288 may be cast
out of prison.

20:23 Now the king, fearing he <116 lose his life, <449 If thou wilt
<56 me I will <35 unto thee whatsoever thou wilt ask, even to half
of the kingdom.

20:24 Now when <72 saw that he had wrought upon the old king
according to his desire, he said unto him: If thou wilt <42 that my
<76 may be cast out of prison, and also that <407 may retain his
kingdom, and that ye be not displeased with him, but <29 that he may
do <46 to his own desires in <80 thing he thinketh, then
will I <95 <258 otherwise I will <136 thee to the <369

20:25 Now when <87 had said <259 <399 the king <183 to rejoice
because of his <179

20:26 And when he saw that <24 had no desire to <252 him, and when
he also saw the great love he had for his son Lamoni, he was astonished
exceedingly, and <168 Because this is all that thou hast desired, that
I <232 <492 thy brethren, and suffer that my son <124 <194
<125 his <124 <422 I will <118 unto you that my son may
<14 his kingdom from this time and forever; and I will govern him no
more—

20:27 And I will also <32 unto thee that thy <180 may be cast out
of <181 and thou and thy <12 may come unto me, in my kingdom;
for I shall greatly <117 to see thee. For the king was <9
<106 at the <412 which he had spoken, and also at the <9
<10 had been spoken by his son <130 therefore he was desirous to
learn them.

20:28 And it came to pass that <170 and <123 proceeded on their
journey towards the land of Middoni. And <12 found favor in the eyes
of the king of the land; <45 the <92 of <31 were brought
<443 out of <362

20:29 And when <14 did meet them he was exceedingly sorrowful, for
behold they were naked, and <55 skins were worn <13 <248
of being bound with strong cords. And they also had suffered hunger,
thirst, and all kinds of afflictions; nevertheless they were patient in
all <33 sufferings.

20:30 And, as it happened, it was <12 lot to have fallen into the
hands of a more hardened and a more stiffnecked people; <96 they
<256 not hearken unto <25 <321 and they had cast them out, and had
smitten them, and had driven them from house to house, and from place
to place, even until they had arrived in the land of Middoni; and there
they were taken and cast into <244 and <109 with <109 cords, and
kept in prison for many days, and were delivered by <180 and Ammon.

Alma Chapter 21

21:1 Now when <164 and his <183 separated themselves in the
borders of the land of the Lamanites, <170 Aaron took his <222
<223 the land <260 was called by the <15 Jerusalem, calling
it after the land of <118 fathers’ nativity; and it was away joining
the <40 of Mormon.

21:2 Now the Lamanites and the Amalekites and the people of Amulon had
built a <436 city, <48 was <48 Jerusalem.

21:3 Now the <25 of <80 were sufficiently hardened, but
the <31 and the Amulonites were still harder; <185 they did
cause the <22 that they <437 harden <71 hearts, that they
<7 wax <146 in wickedness and <11 abominations.

21:4 And it came to pass that <116 came to the city of <108 and
first began to preach to the Amalekites. And he <8 to <8 to them
in <37 synagogues, for they had <94 synagogues <130 the order of
the Nehors; for many of the <84 and the <84 were <16
the <17 of the Nehors.

21:5 Therefore, as <61 entered into one of <41 <36 to <49
unto the people, and as he was speaking unto <280 <198 <256 arose
an Amalekite and <70 to contend with him, saying: What is that thou
hast testified? Hast thou seen an angel? Why do not angels appear unto
us? Behold are not this <187 as good as thy people?

21:6 Thou also sayest, except we repent we shall perish. How knowest
thou the thought and intent of our hearts? How <11 thou that we
have <185 to repent? How <10 thou that we are not a righteous
<45 Behold, we have <142 sanctuaries, and we do assemble ourselves
together to worship God. We do believe that God will save all men.

21:7 Now <137 said unto him: Believest thou that the Son of God <74
come to redeem mankind from <150 sins?

21:8 And the man said unto him: We do not <45 that thou <75 any
such thing. We do not <11 in these foolish traditions. We do not
<9 that thou <20 of things to come, neither do we <11 that
thy fathers and also that our <5 did know concerning the <20
<338 they spake, of that <5 is to come.

21:9 Now <94 <205 to open the scriptures unto them <26 the
coming of Christ, and also <8 the resurrection of the dead, and
that <235 could be no redemption for <109 save it were through the
death and sufferings of <29 and the atonement of his blood.

21:10 And it came to pass as he <59 to expound <111 <80 unto them
they were angry with him, and <14 to mock him; and they would not
hear the words <95 he spake.

21:11 <326 when he saw that they <19 not hear his words, he
departed out of <185 synagogue, and came over to a village <31 was
<470 Ani-Anti, and <98 he found Muloki preaching the word unto
them; and also Ammah and his brethren. And they contended with many
about the word.

21:12 And it came to pass that they saw that the <336 <64 <480
<57 <481 <494 they <64 and came over into the land of
Middoni. And they did <406 the word unto many, and few believed on
the <109 <78 they taught.

21:13 Nevertheless, <203 and a certain number of his brethren were
taken and cast into prison, and the remainder of them fled out of the
land of Middoni unto the regions round about.

21:14 And those who were cast into prison suffered many things, and
they were delivered by the hand of Lamoni and Ammon, and they were fed
and clothed.

21:15 And they went forth again to declare the word, and thus they were
<33 for the first time out of prison; and thus they had suffered.

21:16 And they went <31 whithersoever they were led by the Spirit of
the Lord, <192 the word of God in every synagogue of the
Amalekites, or in <8 assembly of the Lamanites where they <314 be
admitted.

21:17 And it came to pass that the Lord <282 to bless them, insomuch
that they brought many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, they did
convince many of <213 sins, and of the traditions of <7 fathers,
<194 were not correct.

21:18 And it came to pass that Ammon and <146 returned from the land
of <182 to the land of Ishmael, <29 was the land of <37
inheritance.

21:19 And king <27 <270 not suffer that <34 should serve him, or
be his servant.

21:20 But he caused that <331 <17 be synagogues built in the land
of Ishmael; and he <15 that his people, or the <311 who were under
his reign, <25 assemble themselves together.

21:21 And he did rejoice over <134 and he did teach them many things.
And he did also <227 unto them that they were a <40 who were
<41 him, and that they were a free <55 that they were free from
the oppressions of the king, his father; for that his father had
granted unto him that he might reign over the <41 who were in the
land of <145 and in all the land <334 <334

21:22 And he also declared unto them that they <32 have the liberty
of worshiping the Lord <168 God according to <4 desires, in
whatsoever place they were in, if it were in the land <192 was <95
the <64 of king Lamoni.

21:23 And <187 did <443 unto the <75 of king Lamoni; and it came
to pass that he did <145 them all things concerning <2 pertaining
to righteousness. And he did exhort them daily, with all diligence; and
they gave heed unto his <387 and they were zealous for keeping the
commandments of God.

Alma Chapter 22

22:1 Now, as <68 was thus teaching the <68 of <267 continually,
we will return to the account of <506 and his brethren; for after he
departed from the land of <310 he was led by the <414 to the land
of Nephi, even to the house of the king <132 was over all the land
save it were the land of <291 and he was the <218 of <144

22:2 And it came to pass that he went in unto him into the king’s
palace, with his brethren, and bowed himself before the <255 and said
unto him: Behold, O <8 we are the brethren of Ammon, whom thou hast
delivered out of prison.

22:3 And now, O <22 if thou wilt spare our lives, we will be thy
servants. And the king said unto them: Arise, for I will grant unto you
your <22 and I will not <419 that ye shall be my servants; but I
will insist that ye <11 administer unto me; for I have been somewhat
troubled in mind because of the generosity and the greatness of the
words of thy brother Ammon; and I desire to know the cause why he has
not come up out of <190 with thee.

22:4 And <211 said unto the king: <128 the <199 of the Lord has
called him another way; he has gone to the land of <382 to <304
the <252 of <189

22:5 Now the king said unto <122 What is this that ye have said
<324 the <45 of the Lord? <51 this is the thing <239 doth
trouble me.

22:6 And also, what is this that <304 said—If ye will repent ye <134
be saved, and if ye will not repent, ye <11 be cast off at the last
day?

22:7 And <107 answered him and said unto him: Believest thou that
there is a God? And the king said: I know that the Amalekites say that
<16 is a God, and I have granted unto them that they should build
sanctuaries, that they may assemble themselves together to worship him.
And if now thou sayest <31 is a God, behold I will believe.

22:8 And now when <73 heard this, his heart began to rejoice, and he
<66 <136 assuredly as thou livest, O <297 <34 is a God.

22:9 And the king <19 Is God that Great <163 that brought our
fathers out of the land of Jerusalem?

22:10 And <52 said unto him: Yea, he is that <26 Spirit, and he
created all things both in heaven and in earth. <140 thou this?

22:11 And he <53 Yea, I believe that the <29 <55 <26 all
things, and I <299 that ye <134 tell me <233 all these
<13 and I will <25 thy words.

22:12 And it came to pass that when <73 saw that the king would
<21 his words, he <131 from the creation of Adam, reading the
scriptures unto the king—how God <59 man after his own image, and
that God gave him commandments, and that <384 of transgression, man
had fallen.

22:13 And <52 did expound unto him the <38 from the <47
of <48 laying the fall of man <506 him, and their carnal state and
also the plan of redemption, <327 was prepared from the foundation of
the world, through Christ, for all whosoever <93 <92 on his name.

22:14 And since man had fallen he could not merit anything of himself;
but the sufferings and death of Christ atone for <56 sins, <38
faith and repentance, and so forth; and that he breaketh the bands of
death, that the grave <363 have no victory, and that the sting of
<37 <187 be swallowed up in the hopes of glory; and <120 did
<121 all <197 <236 unto the king.

22:15 And it came to pass that <165 <21 had expounded <19 <19
unto him, the king <245 What <54 I do that I may have this eternal
life of <134 thou hast spoken? Yea, what <18 I do that I may be born
of God, having this wicked spirit rooted out of my breast, and receive
his <311 that I may be filled with joy, that I may not be cast off
at the last day? <380 said he, I will give up all that I possess,
yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may <44 this great joy.

22:16 But <104 said unto him: If thou desirest this thing, if thou
wilt bow down <242 God, yea, if thou wilt repent of all thy <192 and
will bow down <16 God, and call on his name in faith, believing that
ye <118 receive, then shalt thou <58 the hope <132 thou desirest.

22:17 And it came to pass that when <66 had said <170 <358 the
king did bow down <46 the Lord, upon his knees; yea, even he did
prostrate himself upon the earth, and cried mightily, saying:

22:18 O God, <37 hath told me that <511 is a God; and if <6 is a
God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I
will give away all my sins to know thee, and that I may be raised from
the dead, and be saved at the last day. And now when the king had said
<99 <99 he was struck as if he were dead.

22:19 And it came to pass that his servants ran and told the queen all
that had happened unto the <318 And she came in unto the king; and
when she saw him lay as if he were <69 and also <121 and his
brethren standing as though they had been the cause of his fall, she
was angry with them, and commanded that her servants, or the <64
of the king, <393 take them and slay them.

22:20 Now the <17 had seen the <38 of the king’s <39 therefore
they durst not lay <453 hands on <64 and his brethren; and they pled
with the <104 <203 Why commandest thou that we <47 slay <139
men, when behold one of them is mightier than us all? Therefore we
<279 fall <248 <63

22:21 Now when the <36 saw the fear of the <70 she also began to
fear exceedingly, lest <235 <45 some evil come upon her. And she
<112 her <21 that they <14 go and call the people, that
they might slay <87 and his brethren.

22:22 Now when <10 saw the determination of the queen, he, also
knowing the hardness of the hearts of the <34 feared lest that a
multitude <46 assemble themselves together, and <66 <6 be a
<427 contention and a disturbance among them; <148 he put forth
his hand and <287 the king from the <348 and said unto him: Stand.
And he stood upon his feet, receiving his strength.

22:23 Now this was done in the presence of the <135 and many of the
servants. And when they saw it they greatly marveled, and <142 to
fear. And the king <43 forth, and <10 to minister unto <173 And he
did <7 unto <261 insomuch that his whole household were
converted unto the Lord.

22:24 Now <108 was a <117 gathered together because of the
commandment of the <145 and <15 <44 to be <122 murmurings <119
them <18 of <164 and his <174

22:25 But the king <68 <131 <18 them and administered unto <68
And they were pacified towards <25 and those who were with him.

22:26 And it came to pass that when the king saw that the people were
pacified, he caused that <30 and his <379 <192 stand <49 in
the midst of the multitude, and that they <13 preach the word unto
<60

22:27 And it came to pass that the king sent a proclamation throughout
all the land, amongst all his <54 who were in all his <10 who were
in all the regions round about, which was bordering even to the sea, on
the east and on the west, and <16 was divided from the land of
Zarahemla by a narrow strip of wilderness, <15 ran from the sea east
even to the sea <28 and <46 about on the borders of the seashore,
and the <7 of the wilderness <28 was on the north by the land of
Zarahemla, through the <17 of Manti, by the head of the river
Sidon, running from the east <181 the west—and thus were the
Lamanites and the Nephites divided.

22:28 Now, the more idle part of the <16 lived in the <84
and dwelt in tents; and they were spread <54 the <68 on the
<88 in the land of Nephi; yea, and also on the west of the land of
<78 in the <78 by the <102 and on the west in the land
of Nephi, in the place of their fathers’ first inheritance, and thus
<173 along by the seashore.

22:29 And also <315 were many <79 on the east by the <42
whither the <102 had driven <242 And thus the <7 were nearly
surrounded by the Lamanites; nevertheless the <10 had taken
possession of all the northern parts of the land <54 on the
<119 at the head of the <159 <158 from the east to the <116
<204 <204 on the <126 side; on the north, even until they came
to the land <206 they called Bountiful.

22:30 And it bordered upon the land <14 they <14 Desolation, it
being so far northward that it came into the land <16 had been
peopled and been destroyed, of whose bones we have spoken, <14 was
discovered by the <331 of <170 it <34 the <155 of <155
<155 landing.

22:31 And they came from <149 up into the south wilderness. Thus the
land on the <59 was <68 <68 and the land on the
southward was <10 Bountiful, it <43 the <112 <56 is filled
with all manner of wild animals of every kind, a part of <16 had come
from the land <41 for food.

22:32 And now, it was only the distance of a day and a half’s journey
for a Nephite, on the line Bountiful and the land <70 from the
east to the west sea; and thus the land of Nephi and the land of
<416 were <234 <233 by water, <111 <85 a small neck of
land between the land <69 and the land southward.

22:33 And it came to pass that the <257 had inhabited the land
<119 even from the east unto the west sea, and thus the <18
in <171 wisdom, with <3 guards and <3 armies, had hemmed in the
<318 on the south, that thereby they should have no more
<299 on the <266 that they might not overrun the land
northward.

22:34 Therefore the <31 could have no more possessions only in
the land of <387 and the <189 <306 about. Now this was wisdom
in the Nephites—as the <27 were an enemy to them, they would not
suffer <76 afflictions on <203 hand, and also that they <60 have a
country <393 they <7 flee, according to <20 desires.

22:35 And now I, after having said this, return again to the account of
Ammon and Aaron, Omner and Himni, and <27 brethren.

Alma Chapter 23

23:1 Behold, now it came to pass that the king of the <81 sent a
proclamation among all his people, that they <143 not lay <37 hands
on Ammon, or <48 or Omner, or <49 nor either of <14 brethren
who <21 go forth preaching the word of God, in whatsoever <367 they
<13 be, in any part of <23 land.

23:2 Yea, he sent a decree <57 <139 that they <21 not lay <18
<56 on them to bind <13 or to cast them into prison; neither <18
they spit upon <13 nor smite <3 nor cast them out of <29
synagogues, nor scourge them; <21 <21 they cast stones at <18
but that they <10 have free access to <22 houses, and also <4
temples, and <4 sanctuaries.

23:3 And thus they <191 go <105 and preach the word <196 to
<19 desires, for the king had been converted unto the Lord, and all
his household; therefore he sent his <163 throughout the land
unto his <166 that the word of God <43 have no obstruction, but
that it <8 go <51 <23 all the land, that his people <10
be convinced concerning the wicked traditions of <60 fathers, and
that they <15 be <14 that they were all brethren, and that they
ought not to murder, nor to plunder, nor to steal, nor to commit
adultery, nor to <5 any manner of wickedness.

23:4 And now it came to pass that when the king had sent <73 this
proclamation, that Aaron and his <242 went <10 from city to city,
and from one house of worship to another, establishing churches, and
consecrating priests and teachers <104 the land <236 the
Lamanites, to <162 and to teach the word of God <13 <209 and thus
they began to have great success.

23:5 And thousands were brought to the knowledge of the <178 yea,
<11 were <11 to believe in the <140 of the Nephites;
and they were taught the records and prophecies which were handed down
even to the present time.

23:6 And as sure as the Lord liveth, so sure as many as believed, or as
many as were <51 to the <62 of the truth, through the
<366 of <433 and his <186 <263 to the spirit of
revelation and of prophecy, and the power of God working miracles in
them—yea, I say unto you, as the Lord <56 as many of the <439
as believed in <237 preaching, and were <294 unto the <116 never
did fall away.

23:7 For they became a righteous people; they did lay down the weapons
of <31 rebellion, that they did not fight against God any more,
<383 <6 any of <16 brethren.

23:8 Now, these are they who were <55 unto the Lord:

23:9 The <315 of the <76 who were in the land of Ishmael;

23:10 And also of the <19 of the <19 who were in the land of
Middoni;

23:11 And also of the <20 of the <20 who were in the city of
Nephi;

23:12 And also of the <20 of the <20 who were in the land of
Shilom, and who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the city of Lemuel,
and in the city of Shimnilom.

23:13 And <111 are the names of the cities of the <44 <261 were
<119 unto the Lord; and <18 are they that laid down the <162
of <146 <162 yea, all <4 <8 of war; and they were all
Lamanites.

23:14 And the Amalekites were not converted, save only one; <177
were any of the Amulonites; but they did harden <34 hearts, and also
the hearts of the <66 in that part of the land wheresoever they
dwelt, yea, and all <23 villages and all <4 cities.

23:15 Therefore, we have named all the <99 of the <33 in <100
they did repent and come to the <334 of the <334 and were
converted.

23:16 And now it came to pass that the king and those who were
<132 were desirous that they might have a name, that thereby they
<8 be distinguished from <69 brethren; therefore the king
consulted with <511 and many of <12 priests, concerning the name
that they should take upon them, that they <30 be distinguished.

23:17 And it came to pass that they called <29 <201
Anti-Nephi-Lehies; and they were <8 by this name and were no more
<9 <179

23:18 And they began to be a very industrious <376 yea, and they
were friendly with the <503 therefore, they did open a
correspondence with <66 and the curse of God did no more follow them.

Alma Chapter 24

24:1 And it came to pass that the <231 and the Amulonites and the
<178 who were in the land of Amulon, and also in the land of
Helam, and who were in the land of Jerusalem, and in fine, in all the
land round about, who had not been <179 and had not taken upon
them the name of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, were stirred up by the <62 and
by the <64 to anger <470 <147 <468

24:2 And <7 hatred <505 exceedingly sore <13 <112 even
insomuch that they <142 to rebel <10 <16 king, <9 that
they would not that he <201 be <12 king; <144 they took up
arms <21 the <433 of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

24:3 Now the king conferred the kingdom upon his son, and he <194 his
name <20

24:4 And the king died in that selfsame year that the <146 <64
to make preparations for war <47 the <47 of God.

24:5 Now when Ammon and his brethren and all <316 who had come up with
him saw the <30 of the <38 to destroy <88 brethren,
they came forth to the land of Midian, and there <35 met all his
<328 and from thence they came to the land of Ishmael that they
<317 hold a council with Lamoni and also with his brother
<182 what they <137 do to defend themselves <85 the
<308

24:6 Now <49 was not one soul among all the <100 who had been
<223 unto the Lord that <173 take up arms <31 <84 <67
nay, they <10 not even make any <100 for war; yea, and also
<17 king commanded them that they <60 not.

24:7 Now, these are the words <481 he said unto the <54 <421
the matter: I thank my God, my beloved people, that our great God has
in goodness sent <30 our <145 the Nephites, unto us to preach
unto us, and to convince us of the traditions of our wicked fathers.

24:8 And behold, I <45 my <39 God that he has given us a portion of
his Spirit to soften our hearts, that we have opened a <422
with <57 <56 the Nephites.

24:9 And <38 I also <39 my God, that by opening this
<23 we have been convinced of our sins, and of the many
murders <117 we have committed.

24:10 And I also <33 my God, yea, my <75 God, that he hath granted
unto us that we <230 repent of <64 things, and also that he hath
forgiven us of <292 our many sins and <47 <47 we have committed,
and <433 away the guilt from our <102 through the merits of his
Son.

24:11 And now <98 my <108 since it has been all that we could
do, (as we were the most lost of all mankind) to <68 of all our sins
and the many <59 <59 we have <59 and to get God to take
them away from our <62 for it was all we <44 do to <34
sufficiently before God that he <283 take away our stain—

24:12 Now, my best <251 <75 <75 God hath <101 away our
stains, and our swords have become bright, then let us stain our <9
no more with the blood of our brethren.

24:13 Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let us retain our <24 that they
be not stained with the <27 of our <356 for perhaps, if we
<340 <45 our <21 again they can no more be washed bright <164
the <24 of the Son of our <217 God, <129 shall be shed for the
atonement of our sins.

24:14 And the <19 God has had mercy on us, and made <231 things
known unto us that we <242 not perish; yea, and he has made <16
<17 <16 unto us beforehand, because he loveth our souls as well as
he <8 our children; therefore, in his <44 he doth visit us by his
angels, that the plan of salvation <45 be made <37 unto us as well
as unto future generations.

24:15 Oh, how merciful is our God! And now <266 <189 it has been as
much as we <222 do to get our stains <201 away from us, and our
<147 are made <201 let us hide them away that they may be kept
<12 as a testimony to our God at the last day, or at the day that
we <159 be brought to stand <267 him to be judged, that we have not
<210 our <50 in the <188 of our brethren <79 he imparted his
word unto us and has made us clean thereby.

24:16 And now, my <290 if our <25 seek to destroy us, <109
we will hide away our swords, yea, even we will bury them deep in the
earth, that they may be kept <95 as a <95 that we have never
used them, at the last day; and if our <47 <45 us, <45 we
<101 go to our God and <6 be saved.

24:17 And now it came to pass that when the king had made an end of
<248 sayings, and all the people were assembled together, they took
their <83 and all the weapons <308 were used for the shedding of
man’s blood, and they did bury them up deep in the earth. Alma 24:18
And this they did, it being in <36 view a <101 to God, and also
to men, that they <107 <450 use <47 <374 for the <45 of
<45 blood; and this they did, vouching and covenanting with God, that
rather than shed the <198 of <42 <126 they <31 give up <6
own lives; and <17 than take away from a brother they <16 give
unto him; and <14 than spend <22 days in idleness they <14 labor
abundantly with <10 hands.

24:19 And thus we see that, when <140 Lamanites were <271 to
believe and to know the truth, they were firm, and <33 suffer even
unto death <47 than commit sin; and thus we see that they buried
<46 <111 of peace, or they <8 the <7 of war, for peace.

24:20 And it came to pass that <23 <283 the Lamanites, made
preparations for war, and came up to the land of Nephi for the purpose
of destroying the king, and to place another in his stead, and also of
<14 the <230 of Anti-Nephi-Lehi out of the land.

24:21 Now when the <14 saw that they were coming against them they
went out to meet <306 and prostrated themselves <392 them to the
<331 and began to call on the name of the Lord; and thus they were in
this attitude when the <152 <20 to fall upon <35 and <6 to
slay them with the sword.

24:22 And thus without meeting any resistance, they did slay a thousand
and five of them; and we know that they are blessed, for they have gone
to dwell with <146 God.

24:23 Now when the <59 saw that <12 <265 <201 not flee
from the sword, neither <8 they turn aside to the right hand or to
the left, but that they <16 lie down and perish, and praised God even
in the very act of perishing under the sword—

24:24 Now when the <55 saw this they did forbear from slaying
<89 and there were many whose hearts had swollen in them for those of
<76 <76 who had fallen <39 the <75 for they repented of the
things <428 they had done.

24:25 And it came to pass that they threw down <32 <282 of war,
and they <89 not take them again, for they were stung for the murders
<37 they had committed; and they came down even as <30 <296
relying upon the mercies of <73 <81 arms were lifted to slay them.

24:26 And it came to pass that the <271 of God were joined that day
by more than the number who had been slain; and <37 who had been
slain were righteous people, therefore we have no reason to doubt but
what they were saved.

24:27 And <147 was not a wicked man <28 among <157 but <10 were
more than a <259 <439 to the knowledge of the truth; thus we see
that the Lord worketh in many ways to the salvation of his people.

24:28 Now the greatest <81 of <77 of the <211 who slew so
many of <132 <194 were Amalekites and Amulonites, the <20
<21 of whom were after the order of the Nehors.

24:29 Now, <77 <35 who <128 the <134 of the Lord, <83 were
none who were <36 or <36 or who were of the <32 of
Nehor, but they were actual descendants of Laman and Lemuel.

24:30 And thus we can plainly discern, that <58 a <44 have been
once enlightened by the Spirit of God, and have had great <128 of
<271 pertaining to righteousness, and then have <288 away into sin
and transgression, they become more hardened, and thus <111 state
becomes worse than though they had never known these things.

Alma Chapter 25

25:1 And behold, now it came to pass that <117 <150 were more
angry because they had <205 <41 brethren; <232 they swore
vengeance upon the Nephites; and they did no more attempt to slay the
<99 of Anti-Nephi-Lehi at that time.

25:2 But they took <33 armies and went over into the borders of the
land of Zarahemla, and fell upon the <31 who were in the land of
Ammonihah, and destroyed <331

25:3 And <149 that, they had many battles with the Nephites, in the
<374 they were driven and slain.

25:4 And <219 the <102 who were <97 were almost all the seed of
Amulon and his <390 who were the priests of Noah, and they were
<22 by the hands of the <115

25:5 And the remainder, having fled into the east wilderness, and
<8 usurped the power and authority over the Lamanites, caused that
many of the <62 should perish by fire <164 of <129 belief—

25:6 For many of them, <104 <33 suffered much loss and so many
afflictions, began to be stirred up in remembrance of the words <112
Aaron and his <348 had preached to them in <41 land; <203
they <26 to disbelieve the traditions of <11 fathers, and to
believe in the <342 and that he gave <292 <85 unto the <107
and thus <354 were many of them converted in the wilderness.

25:7 And it came to pass that <264 rulers who were the remnant of the
children of <161 <117 that they <113 be put to death, yea, all
<23 that believed in <311 <311

25:8 Now this martyrdom <24 that many of <80 <98 <27 be
<114 up to anger; and <69 <97 to be contention in the
wilderness; and the <160 <11 to hunt the seed of <57 and his
<31 and <12 to slay them; and they fled into the east
<96

25:9 And behold they are hunted at this day by the Lamanites. Thus the
<167 of Abinadi were brought to pass, <173 he said concerning the
seed of the <263 who <86 that he <83 suffer death by fire.

25:10 For he said unto them: What ye shall do unto me <4 be a type
of <466 to come.

25:11 And now <54 was the first that <245 <39 by fire <263
of his belief in God; now this is what he meant, that many <59
<60 <21 by fire, according as he had suffered.

25:12 And he said unto the <84 of Noah that <168 seed <26 cause
many to be put to <199 in the like manner as he was, and that they
<20 be scattered abroad and slain, even as a sheep <321 no
shepherd is <416 and <383 by wild beasts; and now behold, <227
<152 were verified, for they were <17 by the <371 and they
were hunted, and they were smitten.

25:13 And it came to pass that when the <226 saw that they could
not overpower the Nephites they returned again to <93 own <353 and
many of them came over to dwell in the land of Ishmael and the land of
Nephi, and did join themselves to the people of God, who were the
<7 of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

25:14 And they did also bury <48 weapons of war, <163 as <6
<285 had, and they <287 to be a righteous people; and they did
walk in the ways of the <409 and did observe to keep his commandments
and his statutes.

25:15 Yea, and they did keep the law of Moses; for it was expedient
that they <179 keep the law of Moses as yet, for it was not all
fulfilled. But notwithstanding the law of Moses, they did look forward
to the coming of Christ, considering that the law of <31 was a type
of his coming, and believing that they must keep <436 outward
performances until the time that he <59 be revealed unto them.

25:16 Now they did not suppose that salvation came by the law of <88
but the law of <50 did serve to strengthen <145 faith in Christ; and
thus they did retain a hope through faith, unto eternal salvation,
relying upon the spirit of prophecy, <413 spake of <68 <377 to
<378

25:17 And now <285 Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni, and <47
<192 did rejoice exceedingly, for the success <32 they had had
among the <298 seeing that the Lord had granted unto them
<220 to <28 prayers, and that he had also verified his word unto
them in every particular.

Alma Chapter 26

26:1 And now, <349 are the <350 of Ammon to his brethren, <56 say
thus: My brothers and my <9 behold I say unto you, how great
reason have we to rejoice; for <344 we have supposed when we started
from the land of Zarahemla that God would have <83 unto us such
<30 blessings?

26:2 And now, I ask, what <11 blessings has he bestowed upon us? Can
ye tell?

26:3 Behold, I answer for you; for our <70 the <129 were in
darkness, yea, even in the darkest abyss, but <166 how many of them
are brought to <92 the marvelous light of God! And this is the
blessing <113 hath been <56 upon us, that we have been made
instruments in the hands of God to bring about this <79 work.

26:4 <70 thousands of them do rejoice, and have been <51 into
the fold of God.

26:5 <20 the field was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did thrust
in the sickle, and did reap with your might, yea, all the day long did
ye labor; and <93 the number of your sheaves! And they shall be
gathered into the garners, that they are not wasted.

26:6 Yea, they <18 not be beaten down by the storm at the last day;
yea, neither <15 they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the
<20 cometh they <15 be <47 together in <292 place, that the
<13 cannot penetrate to them; yea, <32 <17 they be driven with
fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry <421

26:7 But <195 they are in the <164 of the Lord of the harvest, and
they are his; and he will raise them up at the last day.

26:8 Blessed be the name of our God; let us sing to his praise, yea,
let us give thanks to his holy name, for he doth work righteousness
forever.

26:9 For if we had not come up out of the land of Zarahemla, <374 our
dearly beloved <292 who have so <6 <6 us, <339 still
have been racked with hatred against us, yea, and they <13 also have
been strangers to God.

26:10 And it came to pass that when <413 had said <47 words, his
brother Aaron rebuked him, saying: <494 I fear that thy joy doth
<149 thee away unto boasting.

26:11 But <30 said unto him: I do not boast in my own strength, nor
in my own wisdom; but <171 my joy is full, yea, my heart is brim
with joy, and I will rejoice in my God.

26:12 Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak;
therefore I will not <55 of myself, but I will <6 of my God, for
in his <23 I can do all things; yea, <64 many mighty miracles
we have wrought in this land, for <421 we will praise his name
<194

26:13 <385 how many <407 of our brethren has he loosed from the
pains of hell; and they are <415 to sing redeeming love, and this
because of the power of his word <46 is in us, <87 have we not
<454 reason to rejoice?

26:14 Yea, we have <10 to <65 him forever, for he is the Most
High God, and has <60 our <65 from the chains of hell.

26:15 Yea, they were encircled <498 with everlasting darkness and
destruction; but <117 he has <77 them into his <13
light, yea, into <5 salvation; and they are <26 <26
with the matchless bounty of his love; yea, and we have been
instruments in his <383 of doing this <90 and marvelous work.

26:16 Therefore, let us glory, yea, we will glory in the Lord; yea, we
will rejoice, for our joy is full; yea, we will <109 our God <173
<170 who can <25 too much in the Lord? Yea, who can say too much
of his <55 power, and of his mercy, and of his long-suffering towards
the children of men? <34 I say unto you, I <495 say the smallest
part <182 I feel.

26:17 Who could have supposed that our God <386 have been so merciful
as to have snatched us from our awful, sinful, and polluted state?

26:18 <48 we went forth even in wrath, with <282 threatenings to
destroy his church.

26:19 Oh then, why did he not consign us to an awful destruction, yea,
why did he not let the sword of his justice fall upon us, and doom us
to eternal despair?

26:20 Oh, my soul, almost as it were, fleeth at the thought. <68 he
did not exercise his <33 upon us, but in his <145 mercy hath
<241 us over that <236 gulf of death and misery, even to the
salvation of our souls.

26:21 And now <268 my brethren, what natural man is there that
knoweth <506 things? I say unto you, <10 is none that <11 <11
things, save it be the penitent.

26:22 Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth <149
good works, and prayeth continually without ceasing—unto such it is
given to know the mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be <13 to
reveal things <219 never have been revealed; yea, and it <15 be
<16 unto such to bring <448 of souls to repentance, even as it
has been <16 unto us to <16 <84 our <398 to repentance.

26:23 Now do ye remember, my <118 that we said unto our <18
in the land of Zarahemla, we go up to the land of Nephi, to preach unto
our <26 the Lamanites, and they laughed us to scorn?

26:24 For they said unto us: Do ye suppose that ye can <65 the
Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth? Do ye <16 that ye can
convince the <16 of the incorrectness of the traditions of their
fathers, as stiffnecked a people as they are; whose hearts delight in
the shedding of blood; <9 days have been spent in the grossest
iniquity; <10 ways have been the ways of a transgressor from the
beginning? Now my <95 ye remember that this was <50 language.

26:25 And moreover they did say: Let us take up arms against them, that
we <365 them and <24 iniquity out of the land, lest they overrun
us and <15 us.

26:26 But <290 my beloved <52 we came into the wilderness not
with the intent to <22 our <14 but with the <8 that
perhaps we might save some few of <50 <329

26:27 Now when our <122 were depressed, and we were about to turn
back, <51 the Lord comforted us, and said: Go amongst thy <44
the <206 and bear with patience thine afflictions, and I will
give unto you success.

26:28 And now <34 we have come, and been <338 <33 them; and we
have been patient in our sufferings, and we have suffered every
privation; yea, we have traveled from house to house, relying upon the
mercies of the world—not upon the <6 of the world alone but upon
the <9 of God.

26:29 And we have entered into <118 houses and taught <179 and we
have <6 them in <12 streets; yea, and we have <9 them upon
<10 hills; and we have also <30 into <8 temples and <3
synagogues and <19 <94 and we have been cast out, and mocked, and
spit upon, and smote upon our cheeks; and we have been stoned, and
taken and bound with strong cords, and cast into prison; and through
the power and wisdom of God we have been delivered again.

26:30 And we have <137 all manner of <177 and all this,
that <229 we <229 be the means of saving some soul; and we supposed
that our joy would be full if <21 we could be the <21 of <21
some.

26:31 Now <204 we can look <202 and see the fruits of our labors;
and are they few? I say unto you, Nay, they are many; yea, and we can
witness of <139 sincerity, because of <4 love towards <3
<494 and also <6 us.

26:32 For <51 they had rather sacrifice <17 lives than even to
take the life of <10 enemy; and they have buried <6 weapons of war
deep in the earth, <47 of <11 love <41 <3 brethren.

26:33 And now behold I say unto you, has there been so great love in
all the land? Behold, I say unto you, Nay, <16 has not, even among
the Nephites.

26:34 For <78 they <150 take up arms <451 <50 brethren; they
<9 not suffer themselves to be slain. But <54 how many of these
have laid down <21 lives; and we know that they have gone to <10
God, <89 of <5 love and of <4 hatred to sin.

26:35 Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, <80
never were men that had so <101 <17 to rejoice as we, since the
<371 began; yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my
God; for he has all power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he
comprehendeth all things, and he is a merciful Being, even unto
salvation, to those who will repent and believe on his name.

26:36 Now if this is boasting, even so will I boast; for this is my
life and my light, my joy and my <38 and my redemption from
everlasting wo. Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who has been
mindful of this people, who are a branch of the tree of Israel, and has
been lost from its body in a strange land; yea, I say, <39 be the
name of my God, who has been <39 of us, wanderers in a <22
land.

26:37 Now my brethren, we see that God is <21 of every <60
whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his <12 and his
bowels of mercy are over all the earth. Now this is my joy, and my
<202 thanksgiving; yea, and I will give thanks unto my God forever.
Amen.

Alma Chapter 27

27:1 Now it came to pass that when <182 Lamanites who had gone to war
<310 the Nephites had found, after <275 many struggles to destroy
them, that it was in vain to seek <14 destruction, they returned
again to the land of Nephi.

27:2 And it came to pass that the Amalekites, <318 of <25 loss,
were exceedingly angry. And when they saw that they could not seek
revenge from the Nephites, they began to stir up the people in anger
<75 <31 <157 the <8 of Anti-Nephi-Lehi; therefore they
<19 <61 to <78 them.

27:3 Now this <17 <11 refused to take <25 arms, and they
suffered <409 to be slain according to the desires of <15
enemies.

27:4 Now when Ammon and his brethren saw this work of destruction <459
<144 whom they so dearly beloved, and <9 <8 who had so <8
beloved them—for they were treated as though they were angels sent from
God to save them from <316 destruction—therefore, when <46 and
his <47 saw this <217 work of <160 they were moved with
compassion, and they said unto the king:

27:5 Let us gather together this <107 of the Lord, and let us go down
to the land of Zarahemla to our <45 the <158 and flee out of
the hands of our enemies, that we be not destroyed.

27:6 But the king said unto them: Behold, the <248 will <164 us,
<212 of the many murders and sins we have committed <190 <177

27:7 And <101 said: I will go and inquire of the <75 and if he say
unto us, go down unto our <216 will ye go?

27:8 And the king said unto him: Yea, if the Lord saith unto us go, we
will go down unto our <29 and we will be <211 slaves until we
repair unto them the many <78 and sins which we have <79
<80 <80

27:9 But <80 said unto him: It is <13 the law of our <41
<25 was established by my father, that there should be any <48
<235 them; <298 let us go down and rely upon the mercies of our
brethren.

27:10 But the king said unto him: Inquire of the <126 and if he <100
unto us go, we will go; otherwise we will perish in the <512

27:11 And it came to pass that <84 went and inquired of the <35 and
the Lord said unto him:

27:12 Get this <253 out of this land, that they <41 not; for Satan
has <291 hold on the hearts of the <434 who do stir up the
<490 to <412 <128 <160 <268 to slay <112 <112 get
thee out of this land; and blessed are this <48 in this generation,
for I will preserve <167

27:13 And now it came to pass that <89 went and told the king all the
words <170 the Lord had said unto him.

27:14 And they gathered <348 all <64 people, yea, all the <52
of the <118 and did <363 <15 all <15 flocks and herds, and
departed out of the <116 and came into the wilderness <47 divided
the land of Nephi from the land of Zarahemla, and came over near the
borders of the <178

27:15 And it came to pass that <89 said unto <370 <370 I and my
<135 will go forth into the land of <38 and ye shall remain
here <309 we return; and we will try the <173 of our <286
whether they will that ye <22 come into <93 <57

27:16 And it came to pass that as <58 was going <49 into the <102
that he and his <61 met Alma, over in the place of <110 has been
spoken; and behold, this was a joyful meeting.

27:17 Now the joy of <40 was so <246 even that he was full; yea, he
was swallowed up in the joy of his God, even to the exhausting of his
strength; and he fell again to the earth.

27:18 Now was not this exceeding joy? <140 this is joy <70 none
receiveth save it be the truly penitent and humble seeker of happiness.

27:19 Now the joy of Alma in meeting his <105 was <21 great, and
also the joy of Aaron, of Omner, and Himni; but behold <147 joy was
not that to exceed <8 strength.

27:20 And now it came to pass that Alma conducted his <41 back to
the land of Zarahemla; even to his own house. And they went and told
the chief judge all the things that had happened unto them in the land
of Nephi, <488 <53 <219 the Lamanites.

27:21 And it came to pass that the <32 <32 sent a proclamation
throughout all the <213 desiring the voice of the <341 concerning
the admitting <35 <35 who were the <10 of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

27:22 And it came to pass that the <27 of the <17 came, saying:
<170 we will give up the land of Jershon, <175 is on the east by
the sea, <9 joins the land Bountiful, <5 is on the south of the
land Bountiful; and this land Jershon is the land <17 we will give
unto our <145 for an inheritance.

27:23 And <286 we will set our armies between the land <29 and
the land <133 that we may protect our <29 in the land Jershon;
and this we do for our <113 on account of <118 fear to take up
arms against <8 <25 lest they should commit sin; and this <9
<324 fear came because of <7 sore repentance <79 they had, on
<34 of <10 many murders and <4 awful wickedness.

27:24 And now <83 this will we do unto our <58 that they may
inherit the land <74 and we will guard them from <31 enemies
with our armies, on condition that they will give us a portion of <16
substance to assist us that we may maintain our armies.

27:25 Now, it came to pass that when <416 had heard this, he returned
to the <213 of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, and also Alma with him, into the
wilderness, where they had pitched <48 tents, and made known unto
them all these things. And Alma also related unto them his conversion,
with <46 and <377 and his brethren.

27:26 And it came to pass that it did cause <154 joy <329 them. And
they went down into the land of <270 and took possession of the
land of <133 and they were called by the Nephites the <87 of
Ammon; therefore they were distinguished by that name ever after.

27:27 And they were <49 the <22 of <250 and also numbered <8
the <9 who were of the church of God. And they were also
<37 for <117 zeal towards God, and also <4 men; for
they were perfectly honest and upright in all things; and they were
firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end.

27:28 And they did look upon shedding the blood of <46 <288 with
the greatest abhorrence; and they never could be prevailed upon to take
up arms <308 <20 brethren; and they <15 did look upon death with
any degree of terror, for <16 hope and views of Christ and the
resurrection; therefore, <19 was swallowed up to them by the victory
of <17 over it.

27:29 Therefore, they would suffer <22 in the most aggravating and
distressing manner <347 <69 be inflicted by <47 <326 before
they <21 take the sword or cimeter to smite <216

27:30 And thus they were a zealous and beloved people, a highly favored
<175 of the Lord.

Alma Chapter 28

28:1 And now it came to pass that after the <23 of <281 were
established in the land of <257 and a <206 also <10 in
the land of <11 and the <488 of the <258 were set round
about the land of <15 yea, in all the borders <12 <11 the land
of Zarahemla; behold the <27 of the Lamanites had followed <111
<195 into the wilderness.

28:2 And thus there was a tremendous battle; yea, even such an one as
<194 had been <380 <286 all the <88 in the land from the time
Lehi left Jerusalem; yea, and tens of thousands of the <52 were
slain and scattered abroad.

28:3 Yea, and also <51 was a <51 slaughter <40 the <39 of
Nephi; nevertheless, the <27 were driven and scattered, and the
<14 of Nephi <464 again to <90 land.

28:4 And now this was a time that <40 was a <423 mourning and
lamentation <491 throughout all the land, <48 all the <35 of
Nephi—

28:5 Yea, the cry of widows <25 for <44 husbands, and also of
fathers <9 for <9 sons, and the daughter for the brother, yea,
the brother for the father; and thus the cry of <22 was <54
<51 all of them, <8 for <30 kindred who had been slain.

28:6 And now surely this was a sorrowful day; yea, a time of solemnity,
and a time of much fasting and prayer.

28:7 And thus endeth the fifteenth year of the reign of the judges over
the <105 of <153

28:8 And this is the account of <292 and his <350 <68
journeyings in the land of <510 <8 sufferings in the <138 <5
sorrows, and <4 afflictions, and <3 incomprehensible joy, and the
reception and safety of the <270 in the land of Jershon. And now
may the Lord, the Redeemer of all men, bless <29 souls forever.

28:9 And this is the <66 of the wars and contentions <140 the
Nephites, and also the wars between the <347 and the Lamanites; and
the <111 year of the <111 of the <111 is ended.

28:10 And from the first year to the <21 has brought to pass the
destruction of many thousand lives; yea, it has <13 to pass an
awful scene of bloodshed.

28:11 And the bodies of many <332 are laid low in the earth, while
the <13 of many <13 are moldering in heaps upon the face of
the earth; yea, and many <15 are <237 for the loss of <123
kindred, because they have reason to fear, according to the promises of
the <146 that they are consigned to a state of endless wo.

28:12 While many <40 of others truly mourn for the loss of <42
<42 yet they rejoice and exult in the hope, and even know,
<48 to the <48 of the <47 that they are raised to dwell at
the right hand of God, in a <56 of never-ending happiness.

28:13 And thus we see how <399 the inequality of man is <95 of sin
and transgression, and the power of the devil, which comes by the
cunning plans <7 he hath devised to ensnare the hearts of men.

28:14 And thus we see the <44 call of diligence of men to labor in
the vineyards of the Lord; and thus we see the <20 <151 of sorrow,
and also of rejoicing—sorrow <67 of death and <230 <276
men, and joy <10 of the light of Christ unto life.

Alma Chapter 29

29:1 O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart,
that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to
shake the <256 and cry repentance unto every people!

29:2 Yea, I would declare unto <11 soul, as with the <26 of
thunder, <22 and the plan of redemption, that they should repent
and come unto our God, that there <60 not be more sorrow upon all the
face of the earth.

29:3 But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to be
content with the things <192 the Lord hath allotted unto me.

29:4 I <20 not to harrow up in my desires, the firm decree of a just
God, for I know that he granteth unto men <288 to <305 desire,
whether it be unto <187 or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth
unto men, yea, decreeth unto them decrees <63 are unalterable,
<31 to <31 wills, <30 they be unto salvation or unto
destruction.

29:5 Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; he
that knoweth not good from evil is blameless; but he that <10 good
and evil, to him it is given <53 to his <104 <53 he
desireth good or <16 life or death, joy or remorse of conscience.

29:6 Now, seeing that I know these things, why <200 I desire more
than to perform the work to <99 I have been called?

29:7 Why <21 I <21 that I were an <290 that I <291 <278 unto
all the ends of the earth?

29:8 For <218 the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of <137 own
nation and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth
fit that they <55 have; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel
in <21 <120 to that <81 is just and true.

29:9 I know that <12 the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I
do not <7 of myself, but I <5 in that <23 the Lord hath
<24 me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an
instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and
this is my joy.

29:10 And <124 when I see many of my brethren truly penitent, and
coming to the Lord <131 God, then is my soul filled with joy; then do
I remember what the Lord has done for me, yea, even that he hath heard
my prayer; yea, then do I <21 his merciful arm <97 he extended
towards me.

29:11 Yea, and I also <18 the captivity of my fathers; for I
surely do know that the Lord did deliver them out of bondage, and by
this did establish his church; yea, the Lord God, the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, did <32 them out of
bondage.

29:12 Yea, I have always remembered the <62 of my <62 and
that same God who delivered them out of the <167 of the Egyptians did
<37 them out of <36

29:13 Yea, and that same God did <74 his church among them; yea,
and that same God hath called me by a holy calling, to preach the word
unto this people, and hath <398 me much success, in the <148 my joy
is full.

29:14 But I do not joy in my own success alone, but my joy is more full
because of the <12 of my brethren, who have been up to the land of
Nephi.

29:15 Behold, they have labored exceedingly, and have brought forth
much fruit; and how great shall be <251 reward!

29:16 Now, when I think of the <47 of <454 my <276 my soul is
carried away, even to the separation of it from the body, as it were,
so <40 is my joy.

29:17 And now may God <436 unto these, my <85 that they may sit
down in the kingdom of God; yea, and also all those who are the fruit
of <76 labors that they may go no more out, but that they may praise
him forever. And may God <47 that it may be done <450 to my
words, even as I have spoken. Amen.

Alma Chapter 30

30:1 <140 now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon were
established in the land of Jershon, yea, and also <16 the Lamanites
were driven out of the land, and <81 dead were buried by the <31
of the land—

30:2 Now <16 dead were not numbered <216 of the greatness of <10
numbers; neither were the dead of the Nephites numbered—but it came to
pass <53 they had <42 <20 dead, and also <8 the days of
fasting, and mourning, and prayer, (and it was in the sixteenth year of
the reign of the judges over the <70 of Nephi) there began to be
continual peace throughout all the land.

30:3 Yea, and the <21 did observe to keep the commandments of the
Lord; and they were strict in observing the ordinances of God,
<174 to the law of Moses; for they were taught to keep the law of
Moses until it should be fulfilled.

30:4 And thus the <51 did have no disturbance in all the <91
year of the <91 of the <91 over the <19 of <348

30:5 And it came to pass that in the commencement of the seventeenth
year of the <29 of the judges, <115 was <112 peace.

30:6 But it came to pass in the latter end of the <28 year,
<22 came a man into the land of Zarahemla, and he was Anti-Christ,
for he <152 to <471 unto the <70 against the prophecies <463 had
been spoken by the prophets, concerning the coming of Christ.

30:7 Now <43 was no law <25 a man’s belief; for it was strictly
contrary to the commands of God that <20 <142 be a law <43 <5
bring men on to unequal grounds.

30:8 For thus saith the scripture: Choose ye this day, whom ye will
serve.

30:9 Now if a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or
rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to <19 him; but if
he did not believe in him <72 was no law to punish him.

30:10 But if he murdered he was punished unto death; and if he robbed
he was also punished; and if he stole he was also <8 and if he
committed adultery he was also <10 yea, for all this wickedness
they were punished.

30:11 For <61 was a law that men <133 be judged <302 to <377
crimes. Nevertheless, <15 was no law <168 a <168 <168
therefore, a man was <72 only for the crimes <161 he had done;
therefore all men were on equal <164

30:12 And this <235 whose name was Korihor, (and the law could
have no hold upon him) <246 to <246 unto the <246 that <58
<69 be no <237 And <442 this manner did he preach, saying:

30:13 O ye that are bound down under a foolish and a vain hope, why do
ye yoke yourselves with such <13 things? Why do ye look for a
Christ? For no man can know of anything <96 is to come.

30:14 Behold, these things <11 ye call prophecies, <4 ye say are
handed down by holy <317 behold, they are <45 traditions of
your fathers.

30:15 How do ye know of <161 surety? <37 ye cannot know of <40
<37 ye do not see; <148 ye <12 know that <118 shall be a
<118

30:16 Ye look forward and say that ye see a remission of your sins. But
<62 it is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of
your minds comes because of the <78 of your fathers, <59 lead
you away into a belief of <70 <10 are not so.

30:17 And many more such <13 did he say unto them, telling them that
<81 <214 be no atonement made for the sins of men, but every man
fared in this life <282 to the management of the creature;
<113 <16 man prospered <12 to his genius, and that <9
man conquered <10 to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was
no crime.

30:18 And thus he did <266 unto <69 leading away the hearts of
many, causing them to lift up <177 heads in <3 wickedness, yea,
<19 away many women, and also men, to commit whoredoms—telling them
that when a man was dead, that was the end thereof.

30:19 Now this man went over to the land of Jershon also, to <61
<259 <136 among the <330 of Ammon, who were once the <7 of the
Lamanites.

30:20 But behold they were more wise than many of the Nephites; for
they took him, and <339 him, and carried him before <37 who was a
high priest over that people.

30:21 And it came to pass that he caused that he <389 be <29 out
of the land. And he came over into the land of Gideon, and <416 to
<90 unto them also; and here he did not have much success, for he
was taken and <69 and <39 <67 the high priest, and also the
chief judge over the <47

30:22 And it came to pass that the high <85 said unto him: Why do ye
go about perverting the ways of the Lord? Why do ye teach this <144
that <283 <364 be no Christ, to interrupt <210 rejoicings? Why do ye
speak against all the prophecies of the holy prophets?

30:23 Now the high priest’s name was Giddonah. And Korihor said unto
him: Because I do not <48 the <443 <365 of your <365 and
<374 I do not <13 this <61 to bind themselves down under the
<21 ordinances and performances <375 are laid down by ancient
priests, to usurp power and authority over <303 to keep them in
ignorance, that they may not lift up <90 heads, but be brought down
<346 to thy words.

30:24 Ye say that this <58 is a free <226 <502 I say they are
in bondage. Ye say that those <58 <117 are true. <16 I
say that ye do not know that they are <13

30:25 Ye say that this <42 is a guilty and a fallen people, <114
of the transgression of a parent. <37 I say that a child is not
<22 <18 of its parents.

30:26 And ye also say that Christ <197 come. But behold, I say that ye
do not know that <211 <14 be a Christ. And ye say also that he <10
be slain for the sins of the world—

30:27 And thus ye lead away this <84 after the <179 <200 of
your <201 and <148 to your own desires; and ye keep them down,
even as it were in bondage, that ye may glut yourselves with the labors
of <182 hands, that they durst not look up with boldness, and that
they <10 not enjoy <17 rights and privileges.

30:28 Yea, they <13 not make use of that <242 is <18 own lest they
<410 offend <7 <245 who do yoke them <75 to <8
desires, and have <233 them to believe, by <10 <94 and
<4 dreams and <3 whims and <3 visions and <3 pretended
mysteries, that they should, if they did not do <37 to <14
words, <49 some unknown being, who they say is God—a being who never
has been seen or known, who <8 was nor ever will be.

30:29 Now when the high <426 and the <446 <446 saw the hardness of
his heart, yea, when they saw that he would revile even <409 God,
they <7 not make any reply to his words; but they caused that he
<122 be bound; and they delivered him up into the hands of the
officers, and sent him to the land of Zarahemla, that he might be
<135 before Alma, and the <69 <69 who was governor over all the
land.

30:30 And it came to pass that when he was <28 <28 Alma and the
<29 judge, he did go on in the same manner as he did in the land of
Gideon; yea, he went on to blaspheme.

30:31 And he did rise up in great swelling words <43 <71 and did
<125 <124 the priests and teachers, accusing them of leading away
the <317 <317 the silly <223 of <199 <316 for the sake of
glutting on the <299 of the <458

30:32 Now Alma said unto him: Thou knowest that we do not glut
ourselves upon the <24 of this people; for behold I have labored
even from the commencement of the reign of the judges until now, with
mine own <174 for my support, notwithstanding my many travels round
about the land to declare the word of God unto my <68

30:33 And <23 the many <56 <344 I have performed in the
church, I have <278 received so much as even one senine for my labor;
neither has any of my brethren, save it were in the judgment-seat; and
then we have <28 only <333 to law for our time.

30:34 And now, if we do not receive anything for our <62 in the
<58 what doth it profit us to labor in the church save it were to
<98 the truth, that we may have rejoicings in the joy of our
brethren?

30:35 Then why sayest thou that we preach unto this <206 to get gain,
when thou, of thyself, <185 that we <64 no gain? And now,
believest thou that we deceive this people, that causes such joy in
<231 hearts?

30:36 And Korihor answered him, Yea.

30:37 And then Alma said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God?

30:38 And he answered, Nay.

30:39 Now Alma said unto him: Will ye deny again that <26 is a God,
and also deny the Christ? For behold, I say unto you, I know <18 is a
God, and also that Christ shall come.

30:40 And now what evidence have ye that <22 is no God, or that
<21 cometh not? I say unto you that ye have none, save it be your
word only.

30:41 But, <59 I have all things as a testimony that these <6
are true; and ye also have all <9 as a <15 unto you that they
are <16 and will ye deny them? <134 thou that <29 <20 are
true?

30:42 Behold, I know that thou believest, but thou art possessed with a
lying spirit, and ye have put off the Spirit of God that it may have no
place in you; but the devil has power over you, and he doth carry you
about, working devices that he may destroy the children of God.

30:43 And now <223 said unto Alma: If thou wilt show me a sign, that
I may be convinced that <158 is a God, yea, show unto me that he hath
power, and then will I be <20 of the truth of thy words.

30:44 But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt
your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a <60 when ye have the <163
of all <151 thy <424 and also all the holy prophets? The
scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all <169 denote <82 is a
God; yea, even the earth, and all <13 that are upon the face of it,
yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets <500 move in <363
regular form do witness that <40 is a Supreme Creator.

30:45 And yet do ye go <171 leading away the hearts of this <398
testifying unto them <26 is no God? And yet will ye deny against all
<99 witnesses? And he said: Yea, I will deny, except ye <342 show me
a sign.

30:46 And now it came to pass that Alma said unto him: <273 I am
grieved because of the hardness of your heart, yea, that ye will still
resist the spirit of the truth, that thy soul may be destroyed.

30:47 But <355 it is better that thy soul should be lost than that
thou shouldst be the means of bringing many souls down to destruction,
by thy <323 and by thy flattering words; therefore if thou shalt deny
again, behold God <99 smite <196 that thou <11 become dumb, that
thou <6 never open thy mouth any more, that thou <9 not deceive
this people any more.

30:48 Now <321 said unto him: I do not deny the existence of a God,
but I do not believe that <175 is a God; and I say also, that ye do
not know that <15 is a God; and <174 ye show me a <296 I will not
believe.

30:49 Now Alma said unto him: This will I give unto thee for a <23
that thou <85 be struck <101 according to my <122 and I say, that
in the name of God, ye <124 be <19 <19 that ye <6 no more have
utterance.

30:50 Now when Alma had said <255 words, <114 was <23 <23 that
he could not have utterance, <49 to the words of Alma.

30:51 And now when the chief judge saw this, he put forth his hand and
wrote unto Korihor, saying: Art thou <441 of the <506 of God? In
whom did ye desire that Alma <239 show <27 his sign? Would ye that
he <10 afflict others, to show unto thee a <14 <300 he has
showed unto you a sign; and now will ye dispute more?

30:52 And <95 put <39 his hand and wrote, <63 I know that I
am <106 for I cannot speak; and I know that nothing save it were the
<79 of God <120 bring this upon me; yea, and I always knew that
<218 was a God.

30:53 But <338 the devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me
in the form of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this <448
for they have all gone astray after an unknown God. And he said unto
me: There is no God; yea, and he taught me that <507 I <138 say. And
I have <11 his <247 and I <5 them <437 they were pleasing
unto the carnal mind; and I <13 them, even until I had much success,
insomuch that I verily believed that they were true; and for this cause
I withstood the <456 even <25 I have brought this great curse upon
me.

30:54 Now when he had said <247 he besought that Alma <76 pray unto
God, that the <25 might be taken from him.

30:55 But Alma said unto him: If this <17 <25 be <17 from thee
thou wouldst again lead away the hearts of this people; therefore, it
<341 be unto thee even as the Lord will.

30:56 And it came to pass that the <40 was not <40 off of Korihor;
but he was cast out, and went about from house to <2 begging for his
food.

30:57 Now the knowledge of what had happened unto <286 was
immediately published throughout all the land; yea, the proclamation
was sent <299 by the <374 <374 to all the people in the land,
declaring unto those who had <173 in the <403 of <38 that they
must speedily repent, lest the same judgments would come unto them.

30:58 And it came to pass that they were all <405 of the
wickedness of <103 therefore they were all converted <146 unto the
Lord; and this put an end to the iniquity <290 the manner of Korihor.
And <60 did go <123 from <121 to house, <123 food for his
support.

30:59 And it came to pass that as he went <110 among the <335 yea,
<5 a <110 who had separated themselves from the Nephites and
called <7 Zoramites, being led by a man whose name was
Zoram—and as he went <34 amongst <313 <395 he was run upon and
trodden down, even <297 he was dead.

30:60 And thus we see the end of him who perverteth the ways of the
<113 and thus we see that the <433 will not support his children at
the last day, but doth <172 drag them down to hell.

Alma Chapter 31

31:1 Now it came to pass that <146 the end of Korihor, Alma having
received tidings that the Zoramites were perverting the ways of the
Lord, and that Zoram, who was their leader, was leading the <332 of
the <139 to bow down to dumb idols, his heart <203 began to sicken
<450 of the <199 of the people.

31:2 For it was the <433 of <423 sorrow to Alma to know of <21
<181 his <375 <242 his <37 was exceedingly sorrowful <35
of the separation of the <79 from the Nephites.

31:3 Now the <10 had gathered <197 together in a land which
they <206 Antionum, <5 was east of the land of Zarahemla, <8
lay nearly bordering upon the seashore, <8 was south of the land of
Jershon, <9 also bordered upon the wilderness south, <7
<4 was full of the Lamanites.

31:4 Now the <257 greatly feared that the <64 <354 enter
into a correspondence with the Lamanites, and that it <12 be the
means of <118 loss on the part of the <97

31:5 And now, as the preaching of the word had a <22 tendency to lead
the <177 to do that <70 was just—yea, it had had more powerful
effect upon the minds of the <19 than the sword, or anything else,
<23 had <480 unto them—therefore Alma thought it was expedient
that they should try the virtue of the word of God.

31:6 Therefore he took Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner; and Himni he did
leave in the church in Zarahemla; but the former three he took with
him, and also Amulek and Zeezrom, who were at Melek; and he also took
two of his sons.

31:7 Now the eldest of his sons he took not with him, and his name was
Helaman; but the names of those whom he took with him were Shiblon and
Corianton; and these are the <17 of <17 who went with him <283 the
<453 to preach unto them the word.

31:8 Now the <209 were dissenters from the Nephites; <302
they had had the word of God preached unto them.

31:9 But they had fallen into <195 errors, for they <227 not observe
to keep the commandments of God, and his statutes, according to the law
of Moses.

31:10 Neither <25 they <25 the performances of the church, to
continue in prayer and supplication to God daily, that they might not
<286 into temptation.

31:11 Yea, in fine, they did pervert the ways of the Lord in very many
instances; therefore, for this cause, Alma and his brethren went into
the land to <127 the word unto <103

31:12 Now, when they had come into the land, behold, to <483
astonishment they found that the <142 had built synagogues, and
that they did gather <422 <422 on one day of the week, <295
day they did call the day of the Lord; and they did worship after a
manner <19 Alma and his <74 had never beheld;

31:13 For they had a place <52 up in the center of <67 synagogue, a
<11 for standing, <30 was high above the head, and the top thereof
<164 only admit one person.

31:14 Therefore, whosoever desired to <59 must go forth and stand
upon the top thereof, and stretch <10 his hands towards heaven, and
cry with a loud voice, saying:

31:15 Holy, holy God; we believe that thou art God, and we <7 that
thou art holy, and that thou wast a spirit, and that thou art a <6
and that thou wilt be a spirit forever.

31:16 Holy God, we <34 that thou hast separated us from our
brethren; and we do not <14 in the tradition of our brethren, <120
was handed down to them by the childishness of <138 fathers; but we
<23 that thou hast elected us to be thy holy children; and also
thou hast made it known unto us that there shall be no Christ.

31:17 But thou art the same yesterday, today, and forever; and thou
hast <40 us that we <25 be saved, whilst all around us are
<13 to be cast by thy wrath down to hell; for the <85 holiness, O
God, we thank thee; and we also <5 thee that thou hast <28 us,
that we may not be led away <265 the foolish traditions of our
<119 <34 doth bind them down to a belief of Christ, <10 doth
lead <122 hearts to wander far from thee, our God.

31:18 And again we <53 <11 O God, that we are a chosen and a holy
people. Amen.

31:19 Now it came to pass that <63 Alma and his <324 and his sons
had heard these prayers, they were astonished beyond all measure.

31:20 For <394 every man did go <286 and offer up <22 same
prayers.

31:21 Now the <340 was called by them Rameumptom, which, being
interpreted, is the holy stand.

31:22 Now, from this <329 they did <36 up, <44 man, the selfsame
<509 unto God, thanking <119 God that they were <100 of him, and
that he did not lead them away <95 the <275 of <21 <156
and that <5 <145 were not stolen away to <269 in things to
come, <162 they knew nothing about.

31:23 Now, <32 the people had all offered up thanks <8 this
manner, they returned to <38 homes, <462 speaking of <5 God <176
until they had assembled <506 <506 <8 to the holy stand,
to <97 up <32 <32 <21 manner.

31:24 Now when Alma saw this his heart was grieved; for he saw that
they were a wicked and a perverse people; yea, he saw that <32 <96
were set upon gold, and upon silver, and upon all manner of fine goods.

31:25 Yea, and he also saw that <27 <27 were lifted up unto great
boasting, in <10 pride.

31:26 And he <15 up his voice to <503 and cried, <498 O, how
long, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that thy servants <376 dwell here below
in the flesh, to behold such gross wickedness among the children of
men?

31:27 Behold, O God, they cry unto <319 and yet <61 <71 are
swallowed up in <7 <68 <18 O God, they cry unto thee with
<11 mouths, while they are puffed up, even to greatness, with the
vain <217 of the world.

31:28 <31 O my God, <26 costly apparel, and <4 ringlets, and
<4 bracelets, and <3 ornaments of <150 and all <6 precious
<32 <246 they are ornamented with; and <345 <11 <72 are set
upon them, and yet they cry unto thee and say—We <410 <91 O God, for
we are a <311 <266 unto <11 <80 others <134 perish.

31:29 Yea, and they say that thou hast made it known unto them that
there <21 be no Christ.

31:30 O Lord God, how long wilt thou <174 that such <161 and
infidelity <22 be <166 this people? O <190 wilt thou give me
strength, that I may bear with mine infirmities. For I am infirm, and
such <31 <26 this <78 doth pain my soul.

31:31 O <34 my <305 is exceedingly sorrowful; wilt thou comfort my
soul in <72 O <15 wilt thou grant unto me that I may have
<54 that I may <77 with patience <483 afflictions <155 <76
come upon me, because of the iniquity of this people.

31:32 O <38 wilt thou <48 my soul, and give unto me success, and
also my fellow laborers who are with me—yea, Ammon, and Aaron, and
Omner, and also Amulek and Zeezrom and also my two sons—yea, even all
<60 wilt thou comfort, O Lord. Yea, wilt thou <46 <216 souls in
<94

31:33 Wilt thou <96 unto them that they may have <95 that they
may bear <24 <94 <94 <94 come upon them <93 of the
iniquities of this <94

31:34 O <94 wilt thou <36 unto us that we may have success in
bringing them <488 unto thee in <59

31:35 <316 O <26 <47 <71 are precious, and many of them are
our brethren; therefore, give unto us, O <18 power and wisdom that we
may bring these, our brethren, <41 unto thee.

31:36 Now it came to pass that when Alma had said <127 words, that he
clapped his hands upon all them who were with him. And <350 as he
<15 his <15 upon <351 they were filled with the Holy Spirit.

31:37 And after that they did separate themselves one from another,
taking no thought for <9 what they should eat, or what they
<6 drink, or what they <5 put on.

31:38 And the Lord provided for them that they <15 hunger not,
neither <5 they thirst; yea, and he also gave them <193 that
they <13 <289 no manner of afflictions, save it were <508 up
in the joy of <168 Now this was according to the prayer of Alma; and
this <213 he prayed in faith.

Alma Chapter 32

32:1 And it came to pass that they did go forth, and began to preach
the word of God unto the people, entering into <212 synagogues, and
into <5 houses; yea, and even they did <23 the word in <11
streets.

32:2 And it came to pass that <158 much labor <430 <175 they <48
to have <268 <8 the poor class of people; for <197 they were
cast out of the synagogues <95 of the coarseness of <45 apparel—

32:3 Therefore they were not permitted to enter into <14 <21
to worship God, being esteemed as filthiness; therefore they were poor;
yea, they were <11 by <20 brethren as dross; <14 they were
poor as to things of the world; and also they were poor in heart.

32:4 Now, as Alma was teaching and speaking unto the people upon the
hill Onidah, there came a great multitude unto him, who were those of
whom we have been speaking, of whom were poor in heart, <103 of
<67 poverty as to the <61 of the world.

32:5 And they came unto <222 and the one who was the foremost <147
them said unto him: <408 what <451 <362 my <102 do, for they
are despised of all men <49 of <48 poverty, yea, and more
especially by our priests; for they have cast us out of our <152
<487 we have labored abundantly to build with our own hands; and they
have cast us out <40 of our exceeding poverty; and we have no place
to <181 our God; and <217 what <71 we do?

32:6 And now when Alma heard this, he turned him about, his face
immediately towards him, and he beheld with <154 joy; for he <6
that <90 afflictions had truly humbled them and that they were in a
preparation to hear the word.

32:7 <255 he did say no more to the other multitude; but he
stretched forth his hand, and cried unto <197 whom he beheld, who were
<46 penitent, and said unto them:

32:8 I behold that ye are lowly in heart; and if so, blessed are ye.

32:9 Behold thy brother hath said, What <117 we do?—for we are cast
out of our <392 that we cannot <137 our God.

32:10 <27 I say unto you, do ye suppose that ye <18 <18 God
save it be in your <195 only?

32:11 Moreover, I would ask, do ye <24 that ye must not <25 God
only once in a week?

32:12 I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your
<74 that ye may be humble, and that ye may learn wisdom; for it
is necessary that ye should <10 <10 for it is <244 that ye are
cast out, that ye are <298 of your <307 <14 of your
<259 <300 that ye are brought to a lowliness of <154 for ye
are necessarily <11 to be humble.

32:13 And now, <30 ye are compelled to be humble <173 are ye;
for a man sometimes, if he is <15 to be <85 seeketh
repentance; and now surely, whosoever repenteth <183 find mercy; and
he that findeth mercy and endureth to the end the same <16 be saved.

32:14 And now, as I said unto you, that <61 ye were <46 to be
<62 ye were blessed, do ye not <176 that they are more <73
who <270 <16 themselves <25 of the word?

32:15 Yea, he that <14 humbleth himself, and <72 of his sins,
and <67 to the end, the same <67 be blessed—yea, much more
<39 than they who are <60 to be <43 <42 of <366
<158 poverty.

32:16 Therefore, <20 are they who <16 <59 without being
<24 to be humble; or rather, in <361 words, <18 is he that
believeth in the word of God, and is baptized <26 stubbornness of
heart, yea, <6 <32 <189 to know the word, or even <38
to know, before they will believe.

32:17 Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign
from heaven, then we <105 know of a surety; then we <7 <33

32:18 Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a
man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he <11 it.

32:19 And now, how much more cursed is he that <15 the will of God
and doeth it not, than he that only believeth, or only hath <38 to
<39 and falleth into transgression?

32:20 Now of this <57 ye must judge. <74 I say unto you, that it
is on the one hand even as it is on the other; and it <108 be unto
every man according to his work.

32:21 And now as I said concerning faith—faith is not to have a perfect
knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things
which are not seen, <4 are true.

32:22 And now, behold, I say unto you, and I <499 that ye <447
remember, that God is merciful unto all who believe on his name;
<48 he desireth, in the first place, that ye <24 <127 yea,
even on his word.

32:23 And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only
men but women also. Now this is not all; little children do have words
given unto them many times <89 confound the wise and the learned.

32:24 And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have desired to know of me
what ye <161 do <368 ye are afflicted and cast out—now I do not
desire that ye <89 <436 that I mean to judge you only <180
to that <56 is true—

32:25 For I do not mean that ye all of you have been <356 to
<402 yourselves; for I verily <143 that <353 are some among you
who <165 <15 themselves, let them be in whatsoever circumstances
they might.

32:26 Now, as I said <227 faith—that it was not a <226
knowledge—even so it is with my words. Ye cannot know of <468 surety
at first, unto perfection, any more than <240 is a <26 knowledge.

32:27 But <231 if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to
an experiment upon my <478 and exercise a particle of faith, yea,
even if ye can no more than <143 to <230 let this <5 work in
you, even until ye <113 in a manner that ye can give place for a
portion of my <85

32:28 Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give <278
that a seed may be planted in your heart, <89 if it be a true seed,
or a good <5 if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will
resist the Spirit of the Lord, <32 it will begin to swell within
your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will <16
to say <17 yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good <54 or
that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it
<8 to enlighten my understanding, yea, it <7 to be
delicious to me.

32:29 Now <70 <251 not this increase your faith? I say unto you,
Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown up to a <219 <219

32:30 But <28 as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and <48 to
grow, then you must <87 say that the seed is good; for behold it
<22 and <22 and <22 to grow. And now <35 will
not this strengthen your <64 Yea, it will <6 your faith: for
ye will say I know that this is a good seed; for <40 it sprouteth
and <38 to <38

32:31 And now, <42 are ye sure that this is a good seed? I say unto
you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own likeness.

32:32 Therefore, if a seed groweth it is <171 but if it <7 not,
<57 it is not <11 therefore it is cast away.

32:33 And now, <59 <478 ye have tried the experiment, and
<279 the <212 and it swelleth and <124 and <86 to <145
ye must <145 know that the seed is good.

32:34 And now, <37 is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your <4
is <190 in that thing, and your <418 is dormant; and this <57
ye know, for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also
know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth <301 to be
enlightened, and your mind doth <9 to expand.

32:35 O then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, <55 it is
light; and whatsoever is light, is <135 <11 it is discernible,
<140 ye must know that it is <251 and now <102 after ye have
tasted this light is your <105 <109

32:36 Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay aside your <500
for ye have only exercised your <122 to plant the seed that ye might
try the experiment to know if the seed was <163

32:37 And <60 as the tree <185 to <185 ye will say: Let us
nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up,
and bring <269 fruit unto us. And now <37 if ye <27 it with
much care it will get <27 and grow up, and <24 <24 fruit.

32:38 But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its
nourishment, <290 it will not get any root; and when the heat of the
sun cometh and scorcheth it, <169 it hath no root it withers away,
and ye pluck it up and cast it out.

32:39 Now, this is not <26 the seed was not <201 <164 is it
<10 the <100 thereof <496 not be desirable; but it is <11
your ground is barren, and ye will not <111 the <87 <224 ye
cannot have the <28 thereof.

32:40 And thus, if ye will not <21 the word, looking forward with
an eye of <206 to the <25 thereof, ye can never <85 of the <8
of the tree of life.

32:41 But if ye will <36 the <36 yea, <4 the tree as it
<214 to <214 by your <41 with <209 diligence, and with
patience, <56 <56 to the <42 <50 it shall take <159 and
<168 it <7 be a tree springing up unto everlasting <54

32:42 And <118 of your diligence and your <42 and your patience
with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, <246
by and by ye <44 <100 the <57 <57 which is most precious,
<5 is sweet above all that is sweet, and <9 is white <9 all
that is white, yea, and pure <9 all that is pure; and ye shall feast
upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither
<17 ye thirst.

32:43 Then, my brethren, ye <11 reap the rewards of your faith, and
your diligence, and patience, and long-suffering, waiting for the tree
to bring forth <46 unto you.

Alma Chapter 33

33:1 Now after Alma had spoken these words, they sent <23 unto him
desiring to know whether they should believe in one God, that they
might obtain this <42 of which he had spoken, or how they <20
plant the seed, or the word of <16 he had <16 <4 he said must
be planted in their hearts; or in what manner they <28 begin to
exercise <12 faith.

33:2 And Alma said unto them: Behold, ye have said that ye could not
worship your God because ye are cast out of your synagogues. But
behold, I say unto you, if ye suppose that ye cannot <24 God, ye do
greatly err, and ye ought to search the scriptures; if ye <20 that
they have taught you this, ye do not understand them.

33:3 Do ye remember to have read what Zenos, the prophet of old, has
said concerning prayer or worship?

33:4 For he said: Thou art merciful, O God, for thou hast heard my
prayer, even when I was in the wilderness; yea, thou wast merciful when
I prayed <38 those who were mine enemies, and thou didst turn
them to me.

33:5 Yea, O God, and thou wast <29 unto me when I did cry unto
thee in my field; when I did cry unto thee in my <61 and thou <40
hear me.

33:6 And again, O God, when I did turn to my house thou <20 hear me
in my prayer.

33:7 And when I did turn unto my closet, O Lord, and <91 unto thee,
thou <27 hear me.

33:8 Yea, thou art <81 unto thy children when they cry unto <21
to be <136 of thee and not of men, and thou wilt hear <186

33:9 Yea, O God, thou hast been <34 unto me, and <26 my cries in
the midst of thy congregations.

33:10 Yea, and thou hast also <19 me when I have been cast out and
have been despised by mine enemies; yea, thou <85 hear my cries, and
wast angry with mine <185 and thou <13 visit them in thine anger
with speedy destruction.

33:11 And thou <16 hear me <319 of mine afflictions and my
sincerity; and it is <11 of thy Son that thou hast been thus
<94 unto me, therefore I will cry unto thee in all mine
afflictions, for in thee is my joy; for thou hast turned thy judgments
away from me, <40 of thy Son.

33:12 And now Alma said unto <396 Do ye <461 <279 scriptures <432
have been written by them of old?

33:13 <414 if ye do, ye must <22 what Zenos said; for, behold he
<337 Thou hast <56 away thy <57 <53 of thy Son.

33:14 Now <422 my brethren, I would ask if ye have read the
scriptures? If ye have, how can ye disbelieve on the Son of God?

33:15 For it is not <72 that <57 alone spake of these things, but
Zenock also <8 of <8 things—

33:16 For <54 he <72 Thou art angry, O <298 with this people,
<75 they will not <454 thy mercies <116 thou hast bestowed
upon them <14 of thy Son.

33:17 And now, my <89 ye see that a second <466 of old has
testified of the Son of God, and <29 the people <108 not
<45 his words they stoned him to death.

33:18 But <74 this is not all; <86 are not the only ones who have
spoken <468 the Son of God.

33:19 <182 he was <13 of by Moses; yea, and <180 a type was
raised up in the wilderness, that whosoever <61 look upon it might
live. And many did look and <6

33:20 But few understood the meaning of <241 <157 and this <91
of the hardness of their hearts. But there were many who were so
hardened that they <46 not look, <311 they perished. Now the
reason they <11 not look is <34 they did not <262 that it
<12 heal <441

33:21 O my <160 if ye could be healed by merely casting about your
eyes that ye <89 be healed, <27 ye not <111 quickly, or <6 ye
rather harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful, that ye <14
not cast <33 your eyes, that ye <32 perish?

33:22 If so, wo shall come upon you; but if not so, then cast <24
your eyes and begin to <86 in the Son of God, that he will come to
redeem his <274 and that he <35 suffer and die to atone for <143
sins; and that he <13 rise again from the dead, <288 <7 bring to
pass the resurrection, that all men <10 stand before him, to be
judged at the last and judgment day, according to <39 works.

33:23 And now, my <146 I desire that ye <30 plant this word in
your hearts, and as it beginneth to swell even so nourish it by your
faith. And <297 it will become a tree, springing up in you unto
everlasting life. And then may God grant unto you that your burdens may
be light, through the joy of his Son. And even all this can ye do if ye
will. Amen.

Alma Chapter 34

34:1 And now it came to pass that after Alma had <336 <359 <376
unto them he sat down upon the ground, and Amulek arose and began to
teach them, saying:

34:2 My <121 I think that it is impossible that ye should be
ignorant of the things <173 have been <46 <395 the coming of
Christ, who is taught by us to be the Son of God; yea, I know that
<68 <28 were <17 unto you bountifully <193 your dissension
from among us.

34:3 And as ye have desired of my beloved brother that he <62 make
known unto you what ye <8 do, <365 of your afflictions; and he
hath <70 somewhat unto you to prepare your minds; yea, and he hath
exhorted you unto faith and to patience—

34:4 Yea, even that ye <346 have so much <16 as even to <240 the
word in your <240 that ye may try the experiment of its goodness.

34:5 And we have beheld that the great question <137 is in your minds
is whether the word be in the Son of God, or <10 <480 <288 be no
Christ.

34:6 And ye also <36 that my <119 has proved unto you, in many
instances, that the word is in Christ unto salvation.

34:7 My <22 has called upon the <239 of Zenos, that redemption
cometh <286 the Son of God, and also upon the <16 of Zenock; and
also he has appealed unto Moses, to prove that <202 <202 are true.

34:8 And now, <347 I will testify unto you of myself that <19
<20 are <20 Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that <77
<108 come <228 the children of men, to take upon him the
transgressions of his <476 and that he <20 <472 for the sins of
the world; for the Lord God hath <225 it.

34:9 For it is expedient that an atonement <248 be made; for
<464 to the <184 plan of the Eternal God <170 must be an
<20 made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all
are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except
it be <153 the <30 <224 it is <57 <54 be made.

34:10 For it is <11 that <52 <13 be a <62 and last
sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, <3 of
any manner of fowl; for it <120 not be a human <24 but it must
be an infinite and eternal sacrifice.

34:11 Now <48 is not any man that can <43 his own blood <75
will <154 for the sins of another. Now, if a man murdereth, behold
will our law, <19 is just, take the life of his brother? I say unto
you, Nay.

34:12 But the law requireth the life of him who hath murdered;
therefore <62 can be nothing <36 is short of an <80 <137
<8 will suffice for the sins of the world.

34:13 Therefore, it is <140 that <30 <140 be a <140 and last
<116 and then <124 <12 be, or it is <19 <6 <18 be,
a stop to the shedding of blood; then <19 the law of Moses be
fulfilled; yea, it <10 be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and
none <11 have passed away.

34:14 And <339 this is the whole meaning of the law, <25 whit
pointing to that <71 and last <70 and that <6 and last
<170 will be the Son of God, yea, <114 and eternal.

34:15 And thus he <52 bring salvation to all those who <7 believe
on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to <21
about the bowels of mercy, <150 overpowereth justice, and bringeth
<11 means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.

34:16 And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of <27 and encircles
them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no <30 unto
repentance is exposed to the <120 law of the <29 of justice;
<223 only unto him that has <22 unto <21 is brought <65
the <125 and <307 plan of redemption.

34:17 Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin
to exercise your <34 unto repentance, that ye <10 to call upon his
holy name, that he would have <94 upon you;

34:18 Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save.

34:19 Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.

34:20 Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your
flocks.

34:21 Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both
morning, mid-day, and evening.

34:22 Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies.

34:23 Yea, cry unto him <14 the devil, who is an enemy to all
righteousness.

34:24 Cry unto him over the crops of your <73 that ye may prosper
in them.

34:25 Cry over the flocks of your <18 that they may increase.

34:26 But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets,
and your secret places, and in your wilderness.

34:27 Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be
full, drawn out in <161 unto him continually for your welfare, and
also for the welfare of <345 who are around you.

34:28 And now <404 my beloved <244 I say unto you, do not
suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if
ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and
afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to <62 who stand
in need—I say unto you, if ye do not any of <44 <44 <68 your
<96 is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who
do deny the faith.

34:29 Therefore, if ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as
dross, <439 the refiners do cast out, (it <461 of no worth) and is
trodden under foot of men.

34:30 And now, my <130 I <352 that, <120 ye have received so
many witnesses, seeing that the holy scriptures testify of <86
<87 ye come forth and <498 fruit unto <478

34:31 Yea, I <34 that ye <3 come <17 and harden not your <211
any longer; for <116 now is the time and the day of your salvation;
and therefore, if ye will repent and <27 not your hearts,
immediately shall the <469 plan of redemption be <478 <478 unto
you.

34:32 For <42 this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God;
yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their
labors.

34:33 And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many
<132 <80 I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the
day of your repentance until the end; for <160 this day of life, <195
is given us to <73 for eternity, <85 if we do not improve our
time while in this <22 then cometh the night of darkness wherein
there can be no labor performed.

34:34 Ye cannot say, when ye are <132 to that awful crisis, that I
will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye <24 say this; for
that same spirit <73 doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go
out of this <67 that same <19 will have power to <21 your body
in that eternal world.

34:35 For <100 if ye have procrastinated the day of your <128
even <130 death, <14 ye have become subjected to the <39 of the
devil, and he doth seal you his; <166 the Spirit of the Lord hath
withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all
<70 over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.

34:36 And this I know, because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not in
unholy temples, but in the <322 of the righteous doth he dwell; yea,
and he has also said that the <13 <309 sit down in his kingdom,
to go no more out; but <277 garments should be made white through the
blood of the Lamb.

34:37 And now, my beloved <419 I desire that ye <24 <460
<408 <407 and that ye <8 work out your salvation with fear
before God, and that ye <13 no more deny the coming of Christ;

34:38 That ye contend no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye
receive it, and take upon you the name of <27 that ye humble
yourselves even to the dust, and worship God, in whatsoever <170 ye
may be in, in <202 and in truth; and that ye live in thanksgiving
daily, for the many mercies and blessings <277 he doth bestow upon
you.

34:39 Yea, and I also exhort you, my <118 that ye be watchful unto
prayer continually, that ye may not be led away by the temptations of
the <256 that he may not overpower you, that ye may not <275 his
subjects at the last day; for <287 he rewardeth you no good thing.

34:40 And now my <175 <57 I would <63 you to have patience,
and that ye bear with all manner of afflictions; that ye do not revile
<156 those who do cast you out <272 of your exceeding poverty,
lest ye <63 sinners like unto them;

34:41 But that ye have <45 and bear with <31 afflictions, with
a firm hope that ye <274 one day rest from all your afflictions.

Alma Chapter 35

35:1 Now it came to pass that after Amulek had made an end of <263
words, they withdrew themselves from the multitude and came over into
the land of Jershon.

35:2 Yea, and the rest of the <124 <36 they had preached the
word unto the Zoramites, also came over into the land of <29

35:3 And it came to pass that <28 the more popular part of the
Zoramites had consulted together concerning the words <243 had been
<44 unto them, they were angry <147 of the word, for it did
destroy <383 craft; therefore they <189 not hearken unto the words.

35:4 And they sent and gathered <42 throughout all the land all
the people, and <53 with them <54 the <54 <54 had been
spoken.

35:5 Now <45 rulers and <3 priests and <3 teachers did not let
the people know <28 <10 desires; <61 they found out
privily the minds of all the people.

35:6 And it came to pass that <119 they had <23 out the <21 of all
the <69 <228 who were in favor of the <70 <70 had been spoken
by Alma and his brethren were cast out of the land; and they were many;
and they came over also into the land of <180

35:7 And it came to pass that Alma and his <35 did minister unto
them.

35:8 Now the <103 of the <190 were <176 with the <8 of
Ammon who were in Jershon, and the chief ruler of the <236 being
a very wicked man, sent over unto the <25 of <24 desiring them
that they should cast out of <145 land all <112 who came over from
them into <11 land.

35:9 And he breathed out many threatenings <392 <76 And now the
<41 of <41 did not fear <24 words; <180 they did not cast
them out, but they did receive all the poor of the <96 that came
over unto <410 and they did nourish <284 and did clothe <4 and did
give unto them lands for <43 inheritance; and they did administer
unto them according to <11 wants.

35:10 Now this did stir up the <47 to anger <81 the <77 of
Ammon, and they began to mix with the Lamanites and to stir them up
also to <23 <23 <104

35:11 And thus the <35 and the <22 <28 to make
preparations for war <20 the <43 of <42 and also <7 the
Nephites.

35:12 And thus ended the seventeenth year of the reign of the judges
over the <28 of Nephi.

35:13 And the <9 of <157 departed out of the land of <225 and
came over into the land of Melek, and gave place in the land of Jershon
for the armies of the Nephites, that they might contend with the <10
of the <91 and the <7 of the Zoramites; and thus commenced a
war betwixt the <15 and the <29 in the eighteenth year of
the <86 of the judges; and an account shall be given of <178 wars
hereafter.

35:14 And Alma, and <127 and <13 brethren, and also the two sons of
Alma returned to the land of Zarahemla, <417 having been instruments
in the hands of God of bringing many of the <175 to repentance;
and as many as were brought to repentance were driven out of <47
<415 but they have <257 for <8 inheritance in the land of <146
and they have taken up arms to defend themselves, and <18 wives, and
children, and <6 lands.

35:15 Now <90 <389 grieved for the iniquity of his <484 yea for
the wars, and the bloodsheds, and the contentions <487 were among
<330 and <95 been to declare the word, or sent to <6 the <6
<17 all the <222 in every city; and seeing that the hearts of the
<12 <281 to wax hard, and that they <7 to be offended because of
the strictness of the <36 his heart was exceedingly sorrowful.

35:16 Therefore, he caused that his sons <459 be gathered together,
that he <240 give unto them <56 one his charge, separately,
concerning the things pertaining unto righteousness. And we have an
<221 of his commandments, <101 he gave unto them <405 to his
own record.

Alma Chapter 36

36:1 My son, give ear to my <478 for I swear unto you, that inasmuch
as ye <262 keep the commandments of God ye <7 prosper in the land.

36:2 I would that ye <90 do as I have done, in remembering the
captivity of our fathers; for they were in bondage, and none could
deliver them except it was the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob; and he surely did <24 them in <236
afflictions.

36:3 And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and
therefore, I beseech of thee that thou wilt hear my words and learn of
me; for I do know that whosoever <106 put <45 trust in God <6 be
supported in <9 trials, and <3 troubles, and <3 afflictions,
and <15 be lifted up at the last day.

36:4 And I <131 not that ye think that I know of myself—not of the
temporal but of the spiritual, not of the carnal mind but of God.

36:5 Now, <96 I say unto you, if I had not been born of God I
<174 not have known these things; but God has, by the mouth of his
holy angel, made <14 <264 <17 unto me, not of any worthiness of
myself.

36:6 For I went about with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to destroy the
church of God; but <67 God sent his holy angel to stop us by the
way.

36:7 And <18 he spake unto us, as it were the voice of thunder, and
the whole earth did tremble beneath our feet; and we all fell to the
earth, for the fear of the Lord came upon us.

36:8 But <44 the <37 said unto me: Arise. And I arose and stood
up, and beheld the angel.

36:9 And he said unto me: If thou wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no
more to <108 the <107 of God.

36:10 And it came to pass that I fell to the earth; and it was for the
space of three days and <3 nights that I <341 not open my mouth,
neither had I the use of my limbs.

36:11 And the <151 <137 more <192 unto me, <446 were heard by my
brethren, but I did not hear them; for when I <14 the words—If thou
wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to <91 the <91 of
God—I was struck with such great fear and amazement lest perhaps I
<262 be <117 that I fell to the <184 and I did hear no more.

36:12 But I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed
up to the greatest degree and <16 with all my sins.

36:13 Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for <105 I was
tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled
against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments.

36:14 Yea, and I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them
away unto destruction; yea, and in fine so <121 had been my
<63 that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God
did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.

36:15 Oh, <22 I, that I <222 be banished and become extinct both
soul and body, that I might not be brought to stand in the <42 of
my God, to be judged of my deeds.

36:16 And now, for <265 days and for <4 <269 was I racked, even
with the <136 of a damned soul.

36:17 And it came to pass that as I was thus <181 with <196 while
I was <196 up by the memory of my many sins, <383 I remembered
also to have <274 my father prophesy unto the people concerning the
<128 of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the
world.

36:18 Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my
heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall
of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of
death.

36:19 And now, <89 when I <183 this, I <182 <281 my <133
no more; yea, I was <114 up by the <114 of my sins no <335

36:20 And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my
soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!

36:21 Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there <62 be nothing so
exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto
you, my son, that on the other hand, <29 can be <29 so <28
and sweet as was my joy.

36:22 Yea, methought I saw, even as our <200 Lehi saw, God sitting
upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in
the attitude of singing and praising their God; yea, and my soul did
long to be there.

36:23 But <160 my limbs did receive <22 strength again, and I
stood upon my feet, and did manifest unto the <256 that I had been
born of God.

36:24 Yea, and from that time even until now, I have labored without
ceasing, that I <372 bring souls unto repentance; that I <7 <7
them to taste of the <174 joy of <494 I did taste; that they
<18 also be born of God, and be <196 with the Holy Ghost.

36:25 Yea, and now <94 O my son, the Lord doth give me exceedingly
<476 joy in the fruit of my labors;

36:26 For because of the word <55 he has imparted unto me, <34
many have been born of God, and have tasted as I have tasted, and have
seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore they do know of these things
of <41 I have spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge <11 I have is
of God.

36:27 And I have been supported under trials and troubles of every
kind, yea, and in all manner of afflictions; yea, God has delivered me
from prison, and from bonds, and from death; yea, and I do put my trust
in him, and he will still deliver me.

36:28 And I know that he will raise me up at the last day, to dwell
with him in glory; yea, and I will praise him forever, for he has
brought our fathers out of Egypt, and he has swallowed up the Egyptians
in the Red Sea; and he led them by his power into the promised land;
yea, and he has <96 them out of bondage and captivity from time
to time.

36:29 Yea, and he has also <55 our <55 out of the land of
Jerusalem; and he has also, by his <512 power, <39 them
out of <40 and captivity, from time to time even down to the
present day; and I have always retained in remembrance <364 captivity;
yea, and ye also ought to retain in remembrance, as I have done, <16
captivity.

36:30 But <265 my son, this is not all; for ye <26 to know as I do
know, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye <7
prosper in the <128 and ye <27 to know <94 that <23 as ye
will not keep the <25 of God ye <25 be cut off from his
presence. Now this is according to his word.

Alma Chapter 37

37:1 And now, my son Helaman, I command you that ye take the records
<311 have been entrusted with me;

37:2 And I also <21 you that ye keep a record of this people,
<52 as I have <129 upon the plates of Nephi, and keep all <363
<364 sacred <41 I have kept, even as I have kept them; for it is
for a wise purpose that they are kept.

37:3 And <31 <38 of brass, <31 contain <6 engravings, <4
have the <82 of the holy scriptures upon them, <11 have the
genealogy of our forefathers, even from the beginning—

37:4 Behold, it has been prophesied by our fathers, that they should be
kept and handed down from one generation to another, and be kept and
preserved by the hand of the Lord until they <26 go forth unto <433
nation, kindred, tongue, and <127 that they <191 know of the
mysteries contained thereon.

37:5 And now <258 if they are kept they must <280 <274
brightness; yea, and they will <8 <8 <7 yea, and also
<36 all the <122 <105 do <121 that <4 is holy writ.

37:6 Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I
say unto you, that by small and simple <187 are great <3 <390
to pass; and <12 means in many instances doth confound the wise.

37:7 And the Lord God doth work by <19 to bring about his <32 and
eternal purposes; and by very <33 <14 the Lord doth <32 the
wise and bringeth <21 the salvation of many souls.

37:8 And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in God that <225 <71
<163 be preserved; for <140 they have enlarged the memory of this
<166 yea, and convinced many of the error of <142 ways, and <97
them to the knowledge of <10 God unto the <57 of <6 <57

37:9 Yea, I say unto you, were it not for <56 <56 that <3
<280 do contain, <167 are on <8 plates, Ammon and his brethren
could not have <58 so many thousands of the Lamanites of the
incorrect tradition of <49 fathers; yea, <26 <33 and <6
words <71 them unto repentance; that is, they <7 them to the
<78 of the Lord <19 God, and to rejoice in Jesus Christ <8
Redeemer.

37:10 And who knoweth but what they will be the <169 of bringing many
<64 of <359 yea, and also many <7 of our stiffnecked
brethren, the Nephites, who are now hardening <40 hearts in sin and
iniquities, to the <61 of <11 Redeemer?

37:11 Now <88 <324 are not yet fully made known unto me;
therefore I <305 forbear.

37:12 And it may suffice if I only say they are <379 for a wise
purpose, <152 <458 is <31 unto God; for he doth counsel in <231
over all his works, and his paths are straight, and his course is one
<280 round.

37:13 O remember, <1 my son Helaman, how strict are the
commandments of God. And he said: If ye will keep my <11 ye
<81 prosper in the land—but if ye keep not his <13 ye <12
be cut off from his presence.

37:14 And now <49 my son, that God has entrusted you with <129
things, <97 are sacred, <3 he has kept <5 and also <7 he
will keep and preserve for a wise <116 in him, that he may show
<499 his power unto future generations.

37:15 And now <346 I tell you by the spirit of prophecy, that if ye
transgress the <83 of God, <18 <62 <316 <51 are
sacred <91 be taken away from you by the <43 of God, and ye <13
be delivered up unto Satan, that he may sift you as chaff before the
wind.

37:16 But if ye keep the <50 of God, and do with <52 <52
<53 are <52 according to that <6 the Lord doth command you,
(for you must appeal unto the Lord for all <24 whatsoever ye must do
with them) <86 no <73 of earth or hell can take them from you,
for God is powerful to the fulfilling of all his words.

37:17 For he will fulfil all his promises <59 he <103 make unto you,
for he has fulfilled his <13 <13 he has made unto our fathers.

37:18 For he promised unto them that he would <195 <101 <77 for
a wise <198 in him, that he might show <197 his <81 unto <197
<198

37:19 And now <94 one <22 hath he fulfilled, even to the
restoration of many <413 of the <484 to the <398 of the
truth; and he hath shown <41 his <41 in <437 and he will also
still show <12 his <12 in them unto <55 generations; <407
they <108 be preserved.

37:20 Therefore I <174 you, my son <360 that ye be diligent in
<146 all my words, and that ye be <11 in keeping the
<217 of God as they are written.

37:21 And now, I will speak unto you concerning those twenty-four
plates, that ye keep <78 that the <482 and the works of
darkness, and <498 secret <442 or the <4 <11 of <26 people
who have been destroyed, may be made manifest unto this people; yea,
all <25 murders, and robbings, and <5 plunderings, and all <4
wickedness and abominations, may be made <24 unto this <24
yea, and that ye <199 <199 interpreters.

37:22 For <180 the Lord saw that his <56 began to work in
<73 yea, work <69 murders and abominations; <151 the Lord
said, if they did not repent they should be destroyed from off the face
of the earth.

37:23 And the Lord said: I will prepare unto my servant Gazelem, a
stone, <285 <189 shine <202 in darkness unto light, that I may
discover unto my <68 who serve me, that I may <10 unto them the
<139 of <113 brethren, yea, <3 <77 <150 <3 <9 of
<86 and <6 <124 and abominations.

37:24 And now, my son, <119 interpreters were prepared that the word
of God <317 be <299 <66 he spake, saying:

37:25 I will bring <74 out of <75 unto light all <43 <52
<51 and <5 <131 and except they <125 I will destroy
them from off the face of the earth; and I will <34 to <30 all
<26 secrets and <198 unto every nation that <122 hereafter
possess the land.

37:26 And now, my son, we see that they did not repent; <184 they
have been <253 and thus far the word of God has been fulfilled;
yea, <47 <78 abominations have been brought out of <90 and
made known unto us.

37:27 And now, my son, I <365 you that ye retain all <30 oaths,
and <4 covenants, and <3 agreements in <3 <40 <114
yea, and all <7 signs and <3 wonders ye <92 keep from this
people, that they know them not, lest peradventure they <258 fall
into <63 also and be destroyed.

37:28 For <302 there is a curse upon all this land, that destruction
<40 come upon all <369 workers of <223 according to the <463
of God, when they are fully ripe; <131 I desire that this <265
<219 not be <48

37:29 <471 ye <37 keep <241 <92 plans of <86 oaths and
<4 covenants from this <86 and only <7 <268 and <3
<357 and <4 <153 <26 ye make <147 unto them; and ye
<9 teach them to abhor such <23 and <18 and murders;
and ye <14 also <15 them that <52 <67 were <376 on
account of <38 <22 and <22 and <5 murders.

37:30 For <123 they murdered all the prophets of the Lord who came
among them to declare unto them concerning <26 iniquities; and the
blood of <133 whom they <27 did cry unto the Lord <16 God for
vengeance upon <15 who were <9 murderers; and thus the judgments
of God did come upon <76 <163 of <192 and <132 combinations.

37:31 Yea, and cursed be the land forever and ever unto <36 <21
of <22 and <22 combinations, even unto destruction, <362 they
<363 before they are <188 ripe.

37:32 And now, my son, remember the words <408 I have spoken unto you;
trust not <40 <35 <189 unto this <182 but <147 them an
everlasting hatred against sin and iniquity.

37:33 Preach unto them repentance, and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ;
<26 them to humble themselves and to be meek and lowly in heart;
<14 them to withstand <414 temptation of the devil, with <130 <32
on the Lord <33 Christ.

37:34 Teach them to never be weary of good works, but to be meek and
<41 in <41 for such <231 find rest to <36 souls.

37:35 O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, <6 in
thy youth to keep the commandments of God.

37:36 Yea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy
doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the
Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the <10 yea, let the
affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever.

37:37 Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee
for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the <67
that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the
morning let thy <59 be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do <303
things, ye <157 be lifted up at the last day.

37:38 And now, my son, I have somewhat to say <366 the thing
<280 our fathers call a ball, or director—or our <7 called it
Liahona, <14 is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared
it.

37:39 And <419 there cannot any man work after the manner of so
curious a workmanship. And <16 it was <27 to show unto our
<47 the course <45 they should travel in the wilderness.

37:40 And it did work for them according to <256 <292 in God;
therefore, if they had <8 to believe that God could cause that <366
spindles <37 point the way they <5 go, <58 it was done;
therefore they had this miracle, and also many other miracles wrought
by the power of God, day by day.

37:41 Nevertheless, because <41 <18 were worked by small means
it did show unto them marvelous works. They were slothful, and forgot
to exercise <81 <73 and diligence and then <29 <17 works
ceased, and they did not progress in <17 journey;

37:42 Therefore, they tarried in the wilderness, or did not <129 a
<271 course, and were afflicted with hunger and thirst, <68 of
<30 transgressions.

37:43 And now, my son, I would that ye <117 understand that <252
things are not without a shadow; for as our <178 were slothful to
give heed to this compass (now <22 <21 were temporal) they did not
prosper; even so it is with <13 <201 are spiritual.

37:44 For <163 it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ,
<22 will <185 to you a straight <231 to eternal bliss, as it was
for our <65 to give heed to this compass, <24 <90 <24 unto
them a <25 <25 to the promised land.

37:45 And now I say, is <296 not a type in this thing? For just as
surely as this director did bring our fathers, by following its <155
to the <37 land, <381 the words of <80 if we follow <158
<16 carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of
promise.

37:46 O my son, do not let us be <158 <192 of the easiness of
the way; for so was it with our fathers; for so was it <364 for
them, that if they <114 look they might live; even so it is with us.
The way is prepared, and if we will look we may live forever.

37:47 And now, my son, see that ye take care of <215 sacred <489
yea, see that ye look to God and live. Go unto this people and declare
the word, and be sober. My son, farewell.

Alma Chapter 38

38:1 My son, give ear to my words, for I say unto you, even as I said
unto Helaman, that inasmuch as ye <165 keep the commandments of God ye
<8 prosper in the land; and <17 as ye will not keep the
<19 of God ye <18 be cut off from his presence.

38:2 And now, my son, I trust that I <19 have great joy in you,
<178 of your steadiness and your faithfulness unto God; for as you
have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so I
hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments; for blessed is
he that endureth to the end.

38:3 I say unto you, my son, that I have had <67 joy in thee already,
<68 of thy <65 and thy diligence, and thy patience and thy
long-suffering among the <181 of the Zoramites.

38:4 For I know that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I also know that thou
wast stoned for the word’s sake; and thou didst bear all <232 <434
with <46 <56 the Lord was with thee; and now thou knowest that
the Lord did deliver thee.

38:5 And now my son, Shiblon, I <303 that ye <507 remember, that as
much as ye <169 put your <175 in God even so much ye <10 be
delivered out of your trials, and your troubles, and your afflictions,
and ye <17 be lifted up at the last day.

38:6 Now, my son, I <54 not that ye <55 think that I know <95
<96 of myself, but it is the Spirit of God <493 is in me <4
maketh <19 <18 known unto me; for if I had not been born of God I
<40 not have <17 <20 things.

38:7 But behold, the Lord in his <203 mercy sent his angel to <366
unto me that I must stop the work of destruction <201 his people; yea,
and I have seen an <24 face to face, and he spake with me, and his
voice was as thunder, and it shook the whole earth.

38:8 And it came to pass that I was three days and <3 nights in the
most bitter pain and anguish of soul; and never, until I did cry out
unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a remission of my
sins. But <107 I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul.

38:9 And now, my son, I have told you this that ye may learn wisdom,
that ye may <6 of me that there is no other way or means whereby man
can be saved, only in and through Christ. Behold, he is the life and
the light of the world. <12 he is the word of truth and
righteousness.

38:10 And now, as ye have begun to teach the word even so I <259 that
ye <219 <436 to teach; and I <10 that ye <3 be diligent and
temperate in all <231

38:11 See that ye are not <304 up unto pride; yea, see that ye do not
boast in your own <112 nor of your much strength.

38:12 Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle
all your passions, that ye may be filled with love; see that ye refrain
from idleness.

38:13 Do not pray as the Zoramites do, for ye have seen that they pray
to be heard of men, and to be praised for their wisdom.

38:14 Do not say: O God, I thank thee that we are better than our
brethren; but rather say: O Lord, forgive my unworthiness, and remember
my brethren in mercy—yea, acknowledge your unworthiness before God at
all times.

38:15 And may the Lord bless your soul, and <277 you at the last day
into his kingdom, to sit down in peace. Now go, my son, and <198 the
word unto this people. Be sober. My son, farewell.

Alma Chapter 39

39:1 And now, my son, I have somewhat more to say unto thee than what I
said unto thy brother; for <332 have ye not observed the steadiness
of thy brother, his faithfulness, and his diligence in keeping the
commandments of God? <285 has he not set a good example for thee?

39:2 For thou didst not give so much heed unto my words as did thy
<42 <469 the people of the Zoramites. Now this is what I have
against thee; thou <30 go on unto boasting in thy strength and thy
<200

39:3 And this is not all, my son. Thou <24 do that which was grievous
unto me; for thou <11 forsake the ministry, and did go over into the
land of Siron, <65 the borders of the Lamanites, after the harlot
Isabel.

39:4 Yea, she did steal away the hearts of many; but this was no excuse
for thee, my son. Thou shouldst have tended to the ministry wherewith
thou wast entrusted.

39:5 Know ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in the
sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins save it be the
shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?

39:6 For <211 if ye deny the Holy Ghost when it once has had place
in you, and ye know that ye deny it, <23 this is a sin <143 is
unpardonable; yea, and whosoever murdereth <181 the light and
knowledge of God, it is not easy for him to obtain forgiveness; yea, I
say unto you, my son, that it is not easy for him to <18 a
forgiveness.

39:7 And now, my son, I would to God that ye had not been guilty of so
great a crime. I <16 not dwell upon your crimes, to harrow up your
<385 if it were not for your good.

39:8 But <99 ye cannot hide your crimes from God; and except ye
repent they will stand as a testimony <105 you at the last day.

39:9 Now my son, I <57 that ye should <25 and <267 your sins,
and go no more <256 the lusts of your eyes, but cross yourself in all
<218 things; for <53 ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the
kingdom of God. Oh, remember, and take it upon you, and <30 <30
in <29 things.

39:10 And I command you to take it upon you to counsel with your elder
brothers in your undertakings; for <114 thou art in thy youth, and
ye <108 in need to be nourished by your brothers. And give heed to
their counsel.

39:11 Suffer not <60 to be led away by any vain or foolish thing;
suffer not the devil to lead away your heart again <120 those wicked
harlots. <482 O my son, how <205 iniquity ye brought upon the
Zoramites; for when they saw your conduct they <159 not believe in my
words.

39:12 And now the Spirit of the Lord doth say unto me: Command thy
children to do good, lest they lead away the <420 of many <507 to
destruction; therefore I <139 you, my son, in the fear of God, that
ye refrain from your iniquities;

39:13 That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength;
that ye lead away the <48 of no more to do wickedly; but rather
return unto them, and acknowledge your faults and that wrong <388 ye
have done.

39:14 Seek not <138 riches nor the vain <468 of this world; for
<202 you <316 carry them with you.

39:15 And now, my son, I <140 say somewhat unto you concerning the
coming of Christ. <171 I say unto you, that it is he that surely
shall come to take away the sins of the <51 yea, he cometh to
declare glad tidings of salvation unto his people.

39:16 And now, my son, this was the ministry unto <97 ye were called,
to <27 <310 glad <28 unto this <174 to prepare <269 minds;
or <128 that <38 might come unto <130 that they may <15
the minds of <19 <209 to hear the word at the time of his coming.

39:17 And now I will ease your mind <114 on this subject. <109
you marvel why <59 <148 <423 be known so long beforehand. <13
I say unto you, is not a soul at this time as precious unto God as a
soul will be at the time of his coming?

39:18 Is it not as necessary that the plan of redemption <49 be made
<51 unto this <112 as well as unto <95 children?

39:19 Is it not as easy at this time for the Lord to send his angel to
<146 <87 glad <146 unto us as unto our children, or as <250
the time of his <68

Alma Chapter 40

40:1 Now my son, here is <129 more I <248 say unto thee; for I
perceive that thy mind is worried <256 the resurrection of the
dead.

40:2 <139 I say unto you, that there is no resurrection—or, I <35
say, in other words, that this mortal does not put on immortality, this
corruption does not put on incorruption—until <82 the <299 of
<300

40:3 <43 he bringeth to pass the <58 of the <57 But
<343 my son, the <10 is not yet. Now, I unfold unto you a
mystery; nevertheless, <66 are many mysteries <289 are kept, that no
one knoweth them save God himself. But I show unto you one thing <19
I have inquired diligently of God that I <296 know—that is <119
the resurrection.

40:4 <73 <45 is a time appointed that all <373 come forth from
the <78 Now when this time <372 no one knows; but God <58 the
time <50 is appointed.

40:5 Now, whether <37 <31 be one time, or a second <4 or a third
<5 that men <15 come <46 from the dead, it mattereth not; for
God <41 all <244 things; and it sufficeth me to know that this is
the case—that <44 is a time <81 that all <35 rise from the
<80

40:6 Now <18 must needs be a space betwixt the time of death and the
time of the <122

40:7 And now I <230 inquire what becometh of the souls of men from
this time of <29 to the time <57 for the resurrection?

40:8 Now <115 <53 is more than one time <16 for men to rise
it <105 not; for all do not die at once, and this <11 not;
all is as one day with God, and time only is measured unto men.

40:9 Therefore, <46 is a time <44 unto men that they <119 rise
from the dead; and <16 is a <113 between the time of <84 and the
<110 And now, <238 this <14 of <183 what <108 of
the <109 of men is the <267 <217 I have <266 <266 of the
Lord to know; and this is the <16 of <17 I do know.

40:10 And when the time <256 when all <70 rise, then <3 they
know that God <221 all the times <28 are <90 unto man.

40:11 Now, <71 the state of the soul <88 <85 and the
resurrection—Behold, it has been made known unto me by an angel, that
the spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this <435
body, yea, the <17 of all men, <195 they be good or evil, are
taken home to that God who gave them life.

40:12 And then <89 it come to pass, that the <34 of those who are
righteous are received into a <85 of happiness, <100 is called
paradise, a <9 of rest, a <4 of peace, where they <36 rest from
all their troubles and from all care, and sorrow.

40:13 And then <19 it come to <55 that the <55 of the wicked,
yea, who are evil—for <502 they have no part nor portion of the
Spirit of the Lord; for <15 they chose evil works rather than good;
therefore the spirit of the devil did enter into them, and take
possession of <69 house—and <414 <58 be cast out into outer
darkness; <276 <9 be weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth,
and this because of <26 own iniquity, being led captive by the will
of the devil.

40:14 Now this is the <126 of the <290 of the <98 yea, in
darkness, and a <13 of awful, fearful looking for the fiery
indignation of the wrath of God upon them; thus they remain in this
state, as well as the <185 in <175 until the time of <69
<350

40:15 Now, <92 are some that have understood that this <51 of
happiness and this <6 of misery of the soul, before the
resurrection, was a first <33 Yea, I admit it may be termed a
<14 the raising of the <158 or the soul and <55
consignation to <40 or misery, according to the words <250 have
been spoken.

40:16 And <195 again it hath been spoken, that <75 is a <52
<43 a resurrection of all <289 who have been, or who are, or
who <186 be, down to the <18 of Christ from the dead.

40:17 Now, we do not suppose that this <39 <38 <61 is
spoken of in this manner, can be the <30 of the <186 and
<89 <88 to <88 or misery. Ye cannot <30 that this
is what it meaneth.

40:18 Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but it meaneth the reuniting of the
soul with the <416 of <90 from the days of Adam down to the
<55 of Christ.

40:19 Now, <429 the <62 and the bodies of <25 of whom has been
<84 <112 all be reunited at once, the wicked as well as the
righteous, I do not say; let it suffice; that I say that they all come
forth; or in other words, <105 <57 cometh to pass <226 the
<7 of <51 who die after the <7 of <71

40:20 Now, my son, I do not say that <30 <16 <30 at the
<5 of Christ; but <213 I give it as my opinion, that the
<96 and the <96 are reunited, of the <79 at the
<26 of Christ, and his ascension into heaven.

40:21 But <123 it be at his <18 or after, I do not say; but
this much I say, that <260 is a space between death and the
<23 of the <174 and a <336 of the soul in <216 or in
<343 <372 the time <244 is appointed of God that the dead <164
come forth, and be <81 both soul and <34 and be brought to
stand <142 God, and be judged <339 to <124 works.

40:22 Yea, this bringeth about the restoration of <157 things of <48
has been <209 by the mouths of the prophets.

40:23 The soul <57 be restored to the <52 and the body to the soul;
yea, and every limb and joint <19 be <19 to its body; yea, even
a hair of the head <14 not be lost; but all <58 <7 be <21
to <78 proper and perfect frame.

40:24 And now, my son, this is the <83 of <80 has been <79
by the <80 of the prophets—

40:25 And then <40 the righteous shine forth in the kingdom of God.

40:26 But <242 an awful <186 <254 upon the wicked; for they die
as to <70 pertaining to <3 of righteousness; for they are
unclean, and no unclean thing can inherit the <40 of God; but they
are cast out, and consigned to partake of the fruits of <99 labors or
<4 works, <87 have been evil; and they drink the dregs of a bitter
cup.

Alma Chapter 41

41:1 And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the <124
of <38 has been spoken; for <98 some have wrested the scriptures,
and have gone far astray because of this thing. And I perceive that thy
mind has been worried also <37 this <14 But <31 I will
explain it unto thee.

41:2 I say unto thee, my son, that the plan of <61 is requisite
with the justice of God; for it is <10 that all <149 should be
<223 to <119 <222 order. Behold, it is <15 and just,
<312 to the power and <366 of <407 that the soul of man
<29 be <28 to its <291 and that <284 part of the body <13
be <14 to itself.

41:3 And it is <44 with the <68 of God that men <21 be
<364 <52 to <64 works; and if <4 works were good in this
life, and the desires of <12 hearts were good, that they <28 also,
at the last day, be <54 unto that <176 is good.

41:4 And if <26 <38 are evil they <298 be <19 unto them for
evil. Therefore, all <127 <11 be <11 to <20 <126 order,
<98 <275 to its natural frame—mortality raised to immortality,
corruption to incorruption—raised to endless <485 to <289 the
<290 of God, or to <11 <492 to <11 the <10 of the
devil, the one on one hand, the other on the other—

41:5 The one <45 to <38 <122 to his <109 of happiness,
or good <9 to his <9 of good; and the <30 to evil
<12 to his <12 of <324 for as he has desired to do evil all
the day long even so <104 he have his reward of evil when the night
cometh.

41:6 And so it is on the <47 hand. If he hath repented of his sins,
and <44 righteousness until the end of his days, even so he <44
be rewarded unto righteousness.

41:7 These are they that are redeemed of the Lord; yea, these are they
that are taken out, that are delivered from that <148 <69 of
darkness; and thus they stand or fall; for <358 they are <192 own
judges, whether to do good or do <210

41:8 Now, the decrees of God are unalterable; therefore, the way is
prepared that whosoever will may walk therein and be saved.

41:9 And now <46 my son, do not risk one more offense against your
God upon those points of doctrine, <282 ye have hitherto risked to
commit sin.

41:10 Do not suppose, <457 it has been spoken <447
restoration, that ye <135 be <283 from sin to happiness. <409 I
say unto you, wickedness never was <10

41:11 And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I
would say, in a carnal state, are in the gall of bitterness and in the
bonds of iniquity; they are without God in the world, and they have
gone contrary to the nature of God; <139 they are in a <48
<13 to the <13 of <70

41:12 And now <137 is the meaning of the word restoration to take a
<379 of a <379 <30 and place it in an unnatural <74 or to
<9 it in a <15 opposite to its nature?

41:13 O, my son, this is not the case; but the <47 of the word
<48 is to bring back again evil for evil, or <117 for carnal,
or devilish for devilish—good for that <194 is <377 righteous for
that <7 is righteous; just for that <6 is just; merciful for that
<7 is merciful.

41:14 <481 my son, see that you are <18 unto your brethren;
deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do
all <336 <506 then <224 ye receive your reward; yea, ye <7 have
mercy <233 unto you again; ye <9 have justice <8 unto you
<9 ye <9 have a <81 judgment <11 unto you <10 and
ye <12 have good <396 unto you again.

41:15 For that <86 ye do send out <18 return unto you again, and be
restored; <214 the word <143 more fully condemneth the
sinner, and justifieth him not at all.

Alma Chapter 42

42:1 And now, my son, I perceive there is somewhat more <50 doth
worry your mind, <6 ye cannot understand—which is <340 the
<96 of God in the punishment of the sinner; for ye do try to
suppose that it is injustice that the sinner should be consigned to a
<243 of misery.

42:2 Now <282 my son, I will explain this <277 unto thee. For
<12 after the Lord God sent our first parents forth from the garden
of Eden, to till the ground, from whence they were taken—yea, he drew
out the man, and he placed at the east end of the <28 of <27
cherubim, and a flaming sword <106 turned every way, to keep the tree
of life—

42:3 Now, we see that the man had become as God, knowing good and evil;
and lest he <108 put <75 his hand, and take also of the tree of
life, and eat and live forever, the Lord God <71 cherubim and the
<62 sword, that he <31 not partake of the fruit—

42:4 And thus we see, that <195 was a time granted unto man to repent,
yea, a probationary time, a time to repent and serve God.

42:5 For <154 if Adam had put <75 his hand immediately, and
partaken of the tree of <75 he would have lived <75 according to
the word of God, having no space for repentance; yea, and also the word
of God <24 have been void, and the great plan of salvation <10 have
been frustrated.

42:6 But <62 it was appointed unto man to die—therefore, as they
were cut off from the tree of life they <123 be cut off from the face
of the earth—and man became lost <75 yea, they <5 fallen man.

42:7 And now, ye see by this that our <261 <261 were cut off both
temporally and spiritually from the presence of the Lord; and thus we
see they <37 subjects to follow <293 their own will.

42:8 Now <87 it was not expedient that man <74 be reclaimed from
this temporal death, for that <114 destroy the <121 plan of
happiness.

42:9 Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the fall had brought
upon all mankind a spiritual death as well as a temporal, that is, they
were cut off from the <85 of the Lord, it was <64 that
<27 <65 be <65 from this <31 death.

42:10 <54 as they had <319 carnal, sensual, and devilish, by
nature, this <259 <420 <111 a <3 for them to prepare; it
<9 a preparatory state.

42:11 And now remember, my son, if it were not for the plan of
redemption, (laying it aside) as soon as they were dead <147 souls
were miserable, being cut off from the <87 of the Lord.

42:12 And now, <334 was no means to reclaim men from this <217
state, <425 man had <134 upon himself because of his own
disobedience;

42:13 <104 <315 to justice, the plan of redemption <162 not
be <25 about, only on conditions of repentance of men in this
<115 <42 yea, this <106 state; for except it were for
these conditions, mercy <31 not take effect <12 it <160 <215
the work of justice. Now the work of justice <18 not be destroyed; if
so, God <235 cease to be God.

42:14 And thus we see that all <196 were fallen, and they were in
the grasp of justice; yea, the <38 of God, <113 consigned them
forever to be cut off from his presence.

42:15 And now, the plan of <80 <62 not be <110 about <81 an
atonement <83 be made; therefore God <144 atoneth for the sins of
the world, to bring <21 the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of
<152 that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God
also.

42:16 Now, <157 <57 not come unto men <57 <210 were a
punishment, <90 also was eternal as the life of the soul <69 be,
affixed opposite to the plan of happiness, <20 was as <20 also as
the life of the soul.

42:17 Now, how <49 a man repent <48 he <34 sin? How <9 he
sin if <57 was no law? How <10 <6 be a law save <5 was a
punishment?

42:18 Now, <10 was a punishment affixed, and a just law given, <63
<150 remorse of conscience unto man.

42:19 Now, if <24 was no law given—if a man murdered he <62
die—would he be afraid he <235 die if he <11 murder?

42:20 And also, if <29 was no law given against sin men <21 not be
<27 to sin.

42:21 And if <21 was no law <69 if men sinned what <99 <250
do, or <230 either, for they <31 have no claim upon the creature?

42:22 But <30 is a law <30 and a <108 <108 and a
<201 granted; <108 <3 <32 claimeth; otherwise, <39
claimeth the creature and executeth the law, and the law inflicteth the
punishment; if not so, the works of <22 <54 be destroyed, and God
<6 <347 to be God.

42:23 But God ceaseth not to be God, and <49 <45 the penitent,
and <6 cometh <447 of the atonement; and the <316 bringeth
to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the <6 of the dead
<16 back men into the <503 of God; and thus they are restored
into his presence, to be judged <479 to their works, <4 to
the law and <439

42:24 For behold, <92 exerciseth all his demands, and also <69
<76 all <130 is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent
are saved.

42:25 What, do ye suppose that <27 can rob justice? I say unto you,
Nay; not one whit. If so, God <135 <135 to be God.

42:26 And thus God <99 <416 his great and <354 purposes, <58
were prepared from the foundation of the world. And thus <142 <19
the salvation and the redemption of men, and also <108 destruction and
misery.

42:27 Therefore, O my son, whosoever will come may come and partake of
the waters of life freely; and <15 will not come the same is not
compelled to come; but in the last day it shall be <166 unto him
<158 to his deeds.

42:28 If he has desired to do evil, and has not repented in his days,
<169 evil <31 be done unto him, <30 to the restoration of
God.

42:29 And now, my son, I desire that ye <387 let these things trouble
you no more, and only let your sins <10 you, with that <4
<145 <45 bring you down unto repentance.

42:30 O my son, I <38 that ye <38 deny the <235 of God no
more. Do not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point <311 of
your sins, by denying the <24 of God; but do you let the <8 of
God, and his mercy, and his long-suffering have full sway in your
heart; and let it <71 you down to the dust in humility.

42:31 And now, O my son, ye are called of God to preach the word unto
this people. And now, my son, go thy way, declare the word with truth
and soberness, that thou mayest <48 souls unto repentance, that the
<277 plan of <311 may have <490 upon them. And may God grant unto
you even <184 to my words. Amen.

Alma Chapter 43

43:1 And now it came to pass that the sons of Alma did go forth among
the people, to <69 the word unto <47 And Alma, also, himself,
could not rest, and he also went forth.

43:2 Now we <202 say no more concerning <329 preaching, except that
they preached the word, and the truth, <75 to the spirit of
prophecy and revelation; and they <17 after the holy order of God
by <240 they were called.

43:3 And now I return to an account of the wars between the Nephites
and the Lamanites, in the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges.

43:4 For <326 it came to pass that the Zoramites became Lamanites;
therefore, in the commencement of the <30 year the people of the
<44 saw that the Lamanites were coming upon them; therefore they
made preparations for war; yea, they gathered together <116 armies in
the land of Jershon.

43:5 And it came to pass that the <35 came with <22 thousands;
and they came into the land of Antionum, <117 is the land of the
Zoramites; and a man by the name of Zerahemnah was <28 leader.

43:6 And now, as the Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous
disposition than the <53 were, in and of themselves, <111
<32 appointed chief captains over the <146 and they were
all <32 and Zoramites.

43:7 Now this he did that he might preserve <57 hatred towards the
Nephites, that he <10 <319 them into subjection to the
accomplishment of his designs.

43:8 For <176 his designs were to stir up the <68 to anger
against the Nephites; this he did that he <37 usurp <350 power over
them, and also that he <11 gain <10 over the <188 by bringing
them into bondage.

43:9 And now the design of the <17 was to support <82 lands, and
<4 houses, and <3 wives, and <3 children, that they <40
<99 them from the hands of <12 enemies; and also that they <14
<14 <9 rights and <3 privileges, yea, and also <5
liberty, that they <16 worship God <340 to <10 desires.

43:10 For they knew that if they should fall into the <45 of the
<172 that whosoever <11 <28 God in <366 and in <373
the true and the living God, the <137 would destroy.

43:11 Yea, and they also knew the extreme <183 of the <17
<187 <59 brethren, who were the <326 of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, who
were called the <8 of Ammon—and they <36 not take up arms, yea,
they had entered into a covenant and they <15 not break it—therefore,
if they <75 fall into the <86 of the <49 they <16 be
destroyed.

43:12 And the <170 <11 not suffer that they <25 be destroyed;
<376 they gave them lands for <74 inheritance.

43:13 And the <69 of Ammon did give unto the <31 a large
portion of <21 substance to <207 <4 armies; and thus the
<16 were compelled, alone, to withstand <264 the <152 who
were a compound of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, and all
those who had dissented from the <322 who were <345 and
Zoramites, and the descendants of the priests of Noah.

43:14 Now <26 <12 were as numerous, nearly, as were the
<318 and thus the <66 were obliged to contend with <78
<178 even unto bloodshed.

43:15 And it came to pass as the <490 of the <151 had <498
<499 in the land of <471 <372 the <15 of the <41
were prepared to meet them in the land of Jershon.

43:16 Now, the leader of the <96 or the man who had been
<457 to be the <460 captain over the Nephites—now the <6
<7 took the command of all the <51 of the Nephites—and his name
was Moroni;

43:17 And Moroni took all the command, and the government of <106
wars. And he was only twenty and five years old when he was <57
<49 <48 over the <44 of the Nephites.

43:18 And it came to pass that he met the <124 in the borders of
Jershon, and his <248 were armed with swords, and with cimeters, and
all manner of weapons of war.

43:19 And when the <49 of the <35 saw that the <30 of
Nephi, or that Moroni, had <153 his <10 with breastplates and
with arm-shields, yea, and also shields to defend <100 heads, and also
they were dressed with thick clothing—

43:20 Now the army of Zerahemnah was not <37 with any such thing;
they had only <31 swords and <3 <81 <2 bows and <3
arrows, <3 stones and <3 slings; and they were naked, save it
were a skin which was girded about <16 loins; yea, all were <16
save it were the Zoramites and the Amalekites;

43:21 But they were not <135 with breastplates, nor shields—therefore,
they were exceedingly afraid of the <126 of the <270 because of
<42 armor, notwithstanding <3 number being so much greater than
the <191

43:22 Behold, now it came to pass that they durst not come <403 the
<35 in the <196 of Jershon; <455 they departed out of the
land of Antionum into the wilderness, and took <49 journey round
<99 in the <10 away by the head of the river Sidon, that they
might come into the land of Manti and take possession of the land; for
they did not suppose that the <99 of <306 would know whither they
had gone.

43:23 But it came to pass, as soon as they had <77 into the
wilderness <27 sent spies into the <6 to watch <77 camp;
and <253 also, knowing of the prophecies of Alma, sent certain men
unto him, desiring him that he should inquire of the Lord <59 the
<67 of the <131 <12 go to <270 themselves <140 the
Lamanites.

43:24 And it came to pass that the word of the Lord came unto <49 and
Alma informed the messengers of <64 that the <41 of the
<334 were marching <153 <152 in the <152 that they <143
come over into the land of Manti, that they <11 commence an attack
upon the weaker part of the people. And those <44 went and
delivered the message unto Moroni.

43:25 Now <56 leaving a part of his army in the land of <423
lest by any means a part of the <70 <112 come into that land
and take <203 of the city, took the remaining part of his army
and marched over into the land of Manti.

43:26 And he caused that all the <429 in that quarter of the land
<46 gather <156 together to battle <159 the Lamanites, to
<166 <204 lands and <3 country, <2 rights and <3 liberties;
<307 they were <428 <21 the time of the coming of the
<186

43:27 And it came to pass that <247 <60 that his army <52 be
secreted in the valley <426 was near the bank of the <321 <321
<10 was on the west of the <10 Sidon in the wilderness.

43:28 And <39 placed <286 <203 about, that he <189 know when the
camp of the <148 <50 come.

43:29 And now, as <25 knew the intention of the <109 that it
was <102 <9 to destroy <4 brethren, or to subject them and
bring them into bondage that they <47 establish a kingdom unto
<144 over all the <388

43:30 And he also <344 that it was the only desire of the <326
to preserve <45 lands, and <3 liberty, and <3 church, <156
he thought it no sin that he <86 <178 them by stratagem;
therefore, he found by his <111 <131 course the <102 were to
take.

43:31 Therefore, he divided his army and brought a part over into the
valley, and concealed them on the east, and on the south of the hill
Riplah;

43:32 And the remainder he <22 in the west <28 on the west of
the <184 <194 and so down into the borders of the land <290

43:33 And thus having <192 his army according to his desire, he was
<263 to meet them.

43:34 And it came to pass that the <101 came up on the north of
the hill, where a part of the army of <210 was concealed.

43:35 And as the <27 had passed the hill Riplah, and came into
the <89 and began to cross the <88 <88 the army <152 was
<106 on the <123 of the <48 <10 was led by a man whose name
was Lehi, and he led his army forth and encircled the <51 <496
on the east in <212 rear.

43:36 And it came to pass that the <285 when they saw the
<241 <377 upon them in <24 rear, turned them <34 and <75 to
contend with the army of Lehi.

43:37 And the work of death commenced on both sides, but it was more
dreadful on the part of the <50 for <41 nakedness was exposed
to the heavy blows of the <57 with <13 swords and <3
cimeters, <111 <256 <39 almost at every stroke.

43:38 While on the other hand, there was now and then a man fell among
the Nephites, by <32 <35 and the loss of blood, they being
shielded from the more vital parts of the body, or the more <8 <8
of the body <20 <19 from the strokes of the <85 by <37
breastplates, and <4 arm-shields, and <3 head-plates; and thus
the <87 did carry on the work of <84 <63 the Lamanites.

43:39 And it came to pass that the <192 became frightened, because
of the great destruction <23 them, even until they <169 to flee
towards the <246 Sidon.

43:40 And they were pursued by Lehi and his men; and they were driven
by Lehi into the waters of <271 and they crossed the <7 of <32
And Lehi retained his armies upon the bank of the <45 Sidon that they
<456 not cross.

43:41 And it came to pass that <336 and his army met the <89 in
the <325 on the <183 side of the <35 <55 and <89 to fall
upon them and to slay <394

43:42 And the <30 did flee again before <114 <107 the land of
Manti; and they were met <13 by the <79 of Moroni.

43:43 Now in this case the <31 did fight exceedingly; yea, never
had the <9 been known to <11 with such exceedingly <160
strength and courage, no, not even from the beginning.

43:44 And they were inspired by the Zoramites and the Amalekites, who
were <223 chief captains and leaders, and by Zerahemnah, who was <10
<11 captain, or <5 <4 leader and commander; yea, they did <55
like dragons, and many of the <248 were slain by <20 hands, yea,
for they did smite in two many of <12 head-plates, and they did
pierce many of <9 <285 and they did <19 off many of <9
arms; and thus the <107 did <12 in <10 fierce anger.

43:45 Nevertheless, the <53 were <96 by a better cause, for
they were not fighting for monarchy nor power but they were <8
for <32 homes and <3 liberties, <2 wives and <3 children,
and <4 all, yea, for <4 rites of worship and <5 church.

43:46 And they were doing that <435 they felt was the duty <6 they
owed to <22 God; for the Lord had said unto <229 and also unto <12
fathers, that: Inasmuch as ye are not guilty of the first offense,
neither the second, ye shall not suffer yourselves to be <154 by the
hands of your enemies.

43:47 And again, the Lord has said <40 Ye <26 defend your families
even unto bloodshed. Therefore for this cause were the <137
contending with the <458 to <20 themselves, and <69
families, and <4 lands, <2 country, and <3 rights, and <3
religion.

43:48 And it came to pass that when the men of <372 saw the
fierceness and the anger of the <44 they were about to shrink
and flee from <363 And Moroni, perceiving <41 intent, sent forth and
<204 <7 hearts with these thoughts—yea, the thoughts of <8
<65 <3 liberty, yea, <3 freedom from bondage.

43:49 And it came to pass that they turned upon the <53 and they
cried with one voice unto the Lord <29 God, for <3 liberty and
<4 <36 from <36

43:50 And they <443 to stand against the <285 with power; and in
that selfsame hour that they <40 unto the Lord for <31 freedom, the
<20 <26 to flee <452 them; and they fled even to the waters
of Sidon.

43:51 Now, the <22 were more numerous, yea, by more than double
the number of the Nephites; nevertheless, they were driven insomuch
that they were gathered together in one body in the valley, upon the
bank by the river <46

43:52 <227 the <501 of <186 encircled them about, yea, even on
both sides of the river, for behold, on the east were the men of Lehi.

43:53 <31 when Zerahemnah saw the men of Lehi on the east of the
<51 Sidon, and the <47 of <47 on the west of the <12 <12
that they were <58 <233 by the Nephites, they were struck with
terror.

43:54 Now <239 when he saw <153 terror, commanded his men that they
should stop shedding <11 blood.

Alma Chapter 44

44:1 And it came to pass that they did stop and withdrew a pace from
<283 And <72 said unto Zerahemnah: Behold, Zerahemnah, that we do
not desire to be men of <44 Ye know that ye are in our hands, yet we
do not <19 to slay you.

44:2 <34 we have not come out to battle <257 you that we might
shed your blood for <263 <445 do we <30 to bring any one to the
yoke of <291 But this is the very <423 for <498 ye have come
<37 us; yea, and ye are angry with us because of our <415

44:3 But now, ye behold that the Lord is with us; and ye <9 that he
has delivered you into our hands. And now I would that ye <160
understand that this is done unto us <45 of our religion and our
faith in Christ. And now ye see that ye cannot destroy this our faith.

44:4 Now ye see that this is the true <26 of God; yea, ye see that
God will support, and keep, and preserve us, so long as we are faithful
unto him, and unto our faith, and our religion; and never will the Lord
suffer that we shall be destroyed except we <88 fall into
transgression and deny our <67

44:5 And now, <226 I command you, in the name of that
all-powerful God, who has strengthened our arms that we have gained
power over you, by our <60 by our religion, and by our rites of
worship, and by our church, and by the sacred support <200 we owe to
our wives and our children, by that liberty <13 binds us to our lands
and our country; yea, and also by the maintenance of the <33 word of
God, to <24 we owe all our happiness; and by all that is most dear
unto us—

44:6 Yea, and this is not all; I <109 you by all the desires <33
ye have for life, that ye deliver up your weapons of war unto us, and
we will seek not your blood, but we will spare your lives, if ye will
go your way and come not again to war <308 us.

44:7 And now, if ye do not this, <509 ye are in our <385 and I
will <72 my men that they <208 fall upon you, and inflict the
wounds of death in your bodies, that ye may become extinct; and then we
will see who <26 have <194 over this people; yea, we will see who
<12 be brought into <391

44:8 And now it came to pass that when Zerahemnah had heard these
sayings he came forth and <367 up his sword and his cimeter, and
his bow into the hands of Moroni, and said unto him: <466 here are
our <150 of war; we will <158 them up unto you, but we will not
<316 ourselves to take an oath unto you, <184 we know that we <80
break, and also our children; but take our <38 of war, and <27
that we may depart into the wilderness; otherwise we will retain our
swords, and we will perish or conquer.

44:9 <73 we are not of your faith; we do not believe that it is God
that has <111 us into your hands; but we <15 that it is your
cunning that has preserved you from our swords. <39 it is your
breastplates and your shields that have <16 you.

44:10 And now when <162 had made an end of speaking <166 words,
Moroni returned the <162 and the <105 of war, <123 he had
received, unto <430 saying: <47 we will end the conflict.

44:11 Now I cannot recall the words <24 I have spoken, therefore as
the Lord liveth, ye <153 not <136 <479 ye <3 with an oath that
ye will not return <317 <315 us to war. Now as ye are in our <219
we will spill your blood upon the ground, or ye <38 submit to the
conditions <55 I have proposed.

44:12 And now when <99 had said <105 <105 <114 retained his
sword, and he was angry with <261 and he rushed forward that he
might slay Moroni; but as he raised his <22 <373 one of Moroni’s
soldiers smote it even to the earth, and it broke by the hilt; and he
also <16 <50 that he took off his scalp and it fell to the
earth. And <15 withdrew from before them into the midst of his
soldiers.

44:13 And it came to pass that the soldier who stood by, who <44 off
the <41 of <188 took up the <6 from off the ground by the
hair, and laid it upon the point of his <94 and stretched it <392
unto them, saying unto them with a loud voice:

44:14 Even as this <39 has fallen to the <109 <164 is the <9 of
your chief, so <179 ye fall to the earth <220 ye will <402 up
your <268 of war and <229 with a covenant of peace.

44:15 Now there were many, when they <464 <193 <264 and saw the
<46 <50 was upon the <82 that were struck with fear; and many
came <88 and threw down their <47 of war at the feet of <214
and entered into a <53 of <53 And as many as <10 into a
<11 they suffered to <71 into the wilderness.

44:16 Now it came to pass that <194 was exceedingly wroth, and he
did stir up the remainder of his <241 to anger, to contend more
powerfully <325 the Nephites.

44:17 And now <295 was angry, because of the stubbornness of the
Lamanites; <368 he commanded his people that they should fall upon
them and slay them. And it came to pass that they began to slay them;
yea, and the Lamanites did <56 with <119 swords and <3 might.

44:18 But <318 <8 naked skins and <4 bare heads were exposed
to the sharp <23 of the Nephites; yea, behold they were pierced and
smitten, yea, and did fall <114 fast <309 the <20 of the
<21 and they <63 to be swept down, even as the <306 of
<107 had prophesied.

44:19 Now <306 when he saw that they were all about to be
destroyed, cried mightily unto <197 promising that he would <185
and also his <126 with <306 if they <11 spare the <169 of
<92 lives, that they never <11 come to war <496 <171 <138

44:20 And it came to pass that <67 caused that the work of death
<164 cease <23 among the people. And he took the <265 of war
from the <188 and after they had <256 into a <70 with him
of peace they were <261 to <261 into the <261

44:21 Now the number of <76 dead was not numbered <230 of the
greatness of the number; yea, the <17 of <17 dead was <163
great, both on the Nephites and on the Lamanites.

44:22 And it came to pass that they did cast <27 dead into the waters
of Sidon, and they have gone <362 and are buried in the depths of the
sea.

44:23 And the armies of the Nephites, or of <176 returned and came
to <41 houses and <3 lands.

44:24 And thus ended the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges
over the <196 of Nephi. And thus <18 the record of Alma, <439 was
written upon the plates of <16

Alma Chapter 45

45:1 Behold, now it came to pass that the <37 of Nephi were
<131 rejoiced, <148 the Lord had <201 delivered them out of
the hands of <78 enemies; <385 they gave thanks unto the Lord
<10 God; yea, and they did fast much and pray much, and they did
worship God with <43 great joy.

45:2 And it came to pass in the nineteenth year of the <110 of the
<111 over the <73 of Nephi, that Alma came unto his son Helaman
and said unto him: Believest thou the words <119 I spake unto thee
concerning those records <9 have been kept?

45:3 And <28 said unto him: Yea, I believe.

45:4 And Alma said again: <37 thou in Jesus Christ, who shall
come?

45:5 And he said: Yea, I believe all the <55 <46 thou hast spoken.

45:6 And Alma said unto him <36 Will ye keep my commandments?

45:7 And he <32 Yea, I will keep thy commandments with all my heart.

45:8 Then Alma said unto him: Blessed art thou; and the Lord <67
prosper thee in this land.

45:9 But behold, I have somewhat to prophesy unto thee; but what I
<7 unto thee ye <28 not make known; yea, what I <11 unto
thee <11 not be made known, even until the prophecy is fulfilled;
<227 write the <106 <106 I <18 say.

45:10 And these are the words: <274 I perceive that this very
people, the <345 according to the spirit of revelation <29 is in
me, in four hundred years from the time that <167 Christ <42
manifest himself unto them, <6 dwindle in unbelief.

45:11 Yea, and then <11 they see wars and pestilences, yea, famines
and bloodshed, even <83 the <255 of <328 <17 become extinct—

45:12 Yea, and this <334 they <12 <40 in unbelief and fall
into the works of darkness, and lasciviousness, and all manner of
iniquities; yea, I say unto you, that <28 they <28 sin against so
<327 light and knowledge, yea, I say unto you, that from that day,
even the fourth generation <23 not all pass away before this <25
iniquity <10 come.

45:13 And when that <12 day cometh, <206 the time very soon cometh
that <325 who are now, or the seed of <8 who are now numbered among
the <112 of <367 <39 no more be <11 <11 the <10 of
<472

45:14 But whosoever remaineth, and is not destroyed in that <54 and
dreadful day, <29 be <27 <27 the Lamanites, and <7 <148
like unto <182 all, save it be a few who <13 be called the disciples
of the Lord; and them <11 the Lamanites pursue even <182 they <7
<32 extinct. And now, <147 of iniquity, this <275 <11 be
fulfilled.

45:15 And now it came to pass that after Alma had said <278 things to
Helaman, he blessed him, and also his other sons; and he also <10
the earth for the righteous’ sake.

45:16 And he <398 Thus saith the Lord God—Cursed <55 be the land,
yea, this <4 unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and <317 unto
destruction, <312 do wickedly, when they are fully ripe; and as I have
said so <33 it be; for this is the cursing and the blessing of God
upon the <42 for the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree
of allowance.

45:17 And now, when Alma had said <110 <399 he <97 the church,
yea, all <227 who should stand fast in the faith from that time
henceforth.

45:18 And when Alma had done this he departed out of the land of
Zarahemla, as if to go into the land of Melek. And it came to pass that
he was never heard of more; as to his death or burial we know not of.

45:19 <461 this we know, that he was a righteous man; and the saying
went abroad in the church that he was taken up by the Spirit, or buried
by the hand of the Lord, even as Moses. But <351 the scriptures
<199 the Lord took Moses unto himself; and we suppose that he has also
received Alma in the spirit, unto <15 therefore, for this cause we
know nothing concerning his <87 and burial.

45:20 And now it came to pass in the commencement of the nineteenth
year of the reign of the judges over the <382 of <392 that Helaman
went forth <365 the <10 to declare the word unto them.

45:21 For <87 <339 of their wars with the <356 and the many
little dissensions and disturbances <276 had been <33 the <285 it
became expedient that the word of God <224 be declared <15 <405
yea, and that a regulation <11 be made throughout the church.

45:22 Therefore, <71 and his brethren went <73 to establish the
<172 again in all the <297 yea, in <340 city <28 all the
land <62 was possessed by the <95 of <486 And it came to pass
that they did appoint priests and teachers <26 all the <34
over all the churches.

45:23 And now it came to pass that <437 <67 and his <67 had
appointed <31 and <31 over the churches that there arose a
dissension <105 <105 and they would not give heed to the <352 of
<32 and his brethren;

45:24 But they grew proud, being lifted up in <165 hearts, <169 of
<5 exceedingly great riches; therefore they grew rich in <9 own
eyes, and <44 not give heed to <10 words, to walk uprightly before
God.

Alma Chapter 46

46:1 And it came to pass that as many as <32 not hearken to the <75
of <75 and his <107 were gathered together against <43
brethren.

46:2 And now <244 they were <73 wroth, insomuch that they
were determined to slay <263

46:3 Now the leader of <461 who were wroth <36 <36 <42 was
a large and a strong man; and his name was Amalickiah.

46:4 And Amalickiah was desirous to be a king; and <33 <217 who
were <35 were also <14 that he <268 be <41 <16 and they
were the greater part of them the lower <350 of the <226 and they
were seeking for power.

46:5 And they had been led by the flatteries of Amalickiah, that if
they <135 support him and <298 him to be <50 king that he <12
make them rulers over the people.

46:6 Thus they were led away by <93 to dissensions,
notwithstanding the preaching of <165 and his brethren, yea,
<10 <37 <153 <226 care over the church, for they
were high <284 over the <367

46:7 And <286 were many in the <362 who believed in the flattering
<208 of <85 <258 they dissented even from the church; and
thus were the affairs of the <150 of Nephi <53 precarious and
dangerous, <60 <60 <59 victory <384 they had had over
the Lamanites, and <12 <12 rejoicings <12 they had had <308 of
<10 deliverance by the hand of the Lord.

46:8 Thus we see how quick the children of men do forget the Lord <25
God, yea, how <14 to do iniquity, and to be led away by the evil one.

46:9 Yea, and we also see the <62 wickedness one very wicked man can
cause to take place <407 the <49 of men.

46:10 Yea, we see that <125 <82 he was a man of cunning
device and a man of many <144 <382 that he led away the hearts
of many <135 to do wickedly; yea, and to seek to destroy the <171
of God, and to <8 the foundation of liberty <133 God had granted
unto <473 or <8 blessing God had sent upon the face of the land for
the righteous’ sake.

46:11 And now it came to pass that when Moroni, who was the chief
commander of the armies of the Nephites, had heard of these
<275 he was angry with <381

46:12 And it came to pass that he rent his coat; and he took a piece
thereof, and wrote upon it—In memory of our God, our religion, and
freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children—and he fastened it
upon the end of a pole.

46:13 And he <15 on his head-plate, and his breastplate, and his
shields, and girded on his armor about his loins; and he took the pole,
<135 had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he called it the title
of liberty) and he bowed himself to the earth, and he prayed mightily
unto his God for the blessings of <181 to rest upon his <397 so
long as <377 <488 a band of Christians remain to possess the land—

46:14 For thus were all the true believers of Christ, who belonged to
the <230 of God, <68 by those who did not belong to the <424

46:15 And <13 who did <12 to the <24 were faithful; yea, all
<12 who were true <42 in Christ took upon <252 gladly, the
name of <51 or <71 as they were called, <318 of <374
belief in <22 who <88 come.

46:16 And therefore, at this time, Moroni <121 that the <359 of the
Christians, and the freedom of the land might be favored.

46:17 And it came to pass that when he had poured out his soul to God,
he named all the land <190 was south of the land Desolation, yea, and
in fine, all the land, both on the north and on the south—A chosen
<11 and the land of liberty.

46:18 And he said: Surely God shall not suffer that we, who are
despised <111 we take upon us the name of <126 <18 be trodden
down and destroyed, until we bring it upon us by our own
transgressions.

46:19 And when <125 had said <366 <451 he went forth <484 the
people, waving the rent part of his garment in the air, that all <134
see the writing <111 he had written upon the rent part, and crying
with a loud voice, saying:

46:20 Behold, whosoever will maintain this <312 upon the <114 let
them come <55 in the strength of the Lord, and enter into a covenant
that they will <26 <221 rights, and <3 <408 that the Lord
God may bless them.

46:21 And it came to pass that when <103 had proclaimed <103 <103
behold, the people came running together with <34 <399 <403 <400
<5 loins, rending <3 garments in token, or as a covenant, that
they would not forsake the Lord <16 God; or, in other <38 if they
<285 transgress the commandments of God, or fall into transgression,
and be ashamed to take upon them the name of <195 the Lord <24
rend them even as they had rent <42 garments.

46:22 Now this was the <119 <164 they made, and they cast <17
<76 at the feet of Moroni, <163 We <17 with our God, that
we <240 be <236 even as our brethren in the land northward, if
we <14 fall into transgression; yea, he may cast us at the feet of
our enemies, even as we have cast our <51 at thy feet to be
<281 under foot, if we <34 fall into transgression.

46:23 <169 said unto them: <227 we are a remnant of the seed of
Jacob; yea, we are a <11 of the seed of Joseph, whose coat was rent
by his <82 into many pieces; yea, and now <202 let us remember
to keep the <167 of God, or our <72 <61 be rent by our
brethren, and we be cast into prison, or be sold, or be slain.

46:24 Yea, let us preserve our liberty as a <65 of Joseph; yea, let
us <49 the words of Jacob, before his death, for <61 he saw
that a part of the <25 of the coat of Joseph was preserved and had
not decayed. And he said—Even as this <18 of <383 of my son hath
been preserved, so <85 a <13 of the seed of my son be <32
by the hand of God, and be taken unto himself, while the remainder of
the seed of <54 <31 perish, even as the <34 of his garment.

46:25 Now <83 this giveth my soul sorrow; nevertheless, my soul
hath joy in my son, <503 of that part of his seed <284 <37 be
<52 unto God.

46:26 Now <34 this was the language of Jacob.

46:27 And now who knoweth but what the <61 of the seed of <216
<37 <37 perish as his garment, are those who have dissented from
us? Yea, and even it <17 be ourselves if we do not stand fast in the
faith of Christ.

46:28 And now it came to pass that when <287 had said <456 <198 he
went forth, and also sent <509 in all the parts of the land where
there were dissensions, and gathered <472 all the <478 who were
desirous to maintain <397 liberty, to <60 against Amalickiah and
<83 who had dissented, who were called Amalickiahites.

46:29 And it came to pass that when <22 saw that the <38 of
<71 were more numerous than the Amalickiahites—and he also saw that
his <16 were doubtful concerning the justice of the cause in <139
they had undertaken—therefore, fearing that he <488 not gain the
point, he took <65 of his <29 who would and departed into the land
of Nephi.

46:30 Now <58 thought it was not expedient that the Lamanites <36
have any more strength; therefore he <16 to cut off the <38 of
Amalickiah, or to take them and bring them back, and put <101 to
death; yea, for he knew that he <60 stir up the <42 to anger
<142 them, and <94 them to come to battle <9 them; and this
he knew that <35 <26 do that he might obtain his purposes.

46:31 Therefore <85 <69 it was <84 that he <83 take his
armies, who had <202 themselves together, and armed themselves, and
entered into a covenant to keep the peace—and it came to pass that he
took his army and marched out with his tents into the wilderness, to
cut off the course of <70 in the wilderness.

46:32 And it came to pass that he did according to his desires, and
<37 <281 into the <34 and headed the armies of Amalickiah.

46:33 And it came to pass that <43 fled with a small number of
his men, and the <450 were delivered up into the hands of <119
and were <415 back into the land of Zarahemla.

46:34 Now, <16 being a man who was appointed by the chief judges and
the voice of the people, <223 he had power <85 to his will
with the <78 of the Nephites, to establish and to exercise authority
over them.

46:35 And it came to pass that whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that
<206 not enter into a <173 to support the <230 of freedom, that
they <217 <387 a free government, he caused to be put to <265
and <414 were but few who denied the <31 of freedom.

46:36 And it came to pass also, that he <30 the title of liberty to
be hoisted upon every tower <376 was in all the land, <6 was
possessed by the Nephites; and thus <136 planted the standard of
<29 among the Nephites.

46:37 And they began to have peace again in the land; and thus they did
<91 <11 in the land until nearly the end of the nineteenth year
of the reign of the judges.

46:38 And Helaman and the high priests did also <32 order in the
church; yea, even for the space of four years did they have much <49
and rejoicing in the church.

46:39 And it came to pass that <145 were many who died, firmly
believing that their souls were redeemed by the Lord Jesus Christ; thus
they went out of the world rejoicing.

46:40 And <32 were some who died with fevers, <144 at some seasons
of the year were very frequent in the land—but not so much so with
<21 because of the excellent qualities of the many plants and roots
<33 God had prepared to remove the <244 of diseases, to <11 men
were subject by the nature of the climate—

46:41 But <67 were many who died with old age; and those who died in
the faith of Christ are happy in him, as we must needs suppose.

Alma Chapter 47

47:1 Now we will return in our record to <412 and <38 who had
fled with him into the wilderness; for, behold, he had <404 <15 who
went with him, and went up in the land of Nephi <264 the Lamanites,
and did stir up the Lamanites to anger against the people of Nephi,
insomuch that the king of the <15 sent a proclamation throughout
all his <313 <33 all his <426 that they should gather themselves
together <295 to go to battle <37 the <313

47:2 And it came to pass that when the <37 had gone forth
<36 them they were exceedingly afraid; yea, they feared to displease
the king, and they also <9 to go to <42 <42 the Nephites
lest they <58 lose <265 lives. And it came to pass that they <457
not, or the more part of them <9 not, obey the commandments of the
king.

47:3 And now it came to pass that the king was wroth <256 of <44
disobedience; therefore he gave <180 the command of that part of
his army <251 was obedient unto his commands, and commanded him that
he <74 go <106 and compel them to arms.

47:4 Now <202 this was the desire of Amalickiah; for he being a very
subtle man to do evil <56 he laid the plan in his heart to
dethrone the king of the Lamanites.

47:5 And now he had got the <77 of <244 parts of the <210 who
were in favor of the king; and he sought to gain <9 of <20 who
were not obedient; <54 he went forward to the place <104 was
called Onidah, for thither had all the <39 fled; for they
discovered the army coming, and, supposing that they were coming to
destroy them, <36 they fled to <29 to the <37 of <123

47:6 And they had appointed a man to be a king and a leader over <29
<129 fixed in <182 minds with a determined resolution that they <216
not be subjected to go <249 the <291

47:7 And it came to pass that they had gathered <315 <314
upon the top of the mount <102 was <101 Antipas, in preparation to
battle.

47:8 Now it was not Amalickiah’s intention to give them <297
according to the <271 of the <153 but <213 it was his
<19 to gain <157 with the armies of the <409 that he might
<117 himself at <94 head and <210 the king and take possession
of the kingdom.

47:9 And <40 it came to pass that he caused his army to pitch <30
tents in the valley <90 was near the <95 Antipas.

47:10 And it came to pass that when it was night he sent a secret
embassy into the <24 <116 desiring that the <170 of <240 who
were upon the mount, whose name was Lehonti, that he <332 come down
to the foot of the <16 for he desired to speak with him.

47:11 And it came to pass that when Lehonti received the message he
durst not go down to the foot of the mount. And it came to pass that
<405 sent <512 the second time, <75 him to come down. And
it came to pass that <41 <240 not; and he sent <22 the third
time.

47:12 And it came to pass that when <40 found that he could not
get <30 to come down off from the <97 he went up into the <6
nearly to Lehonti’s camp; and he sent <46 the fourth time his <95
unto <132 <73 that he <63 come down, and that he <6 bring
his guards with him.

47:13 And it came to pass that when <58 had come down with his
<21 to Amalickiah, that <77 <157 him to come down with his
army in the night-time, and surround <196 men in <240 camps over whom
the king had given him command, and that he <61 deliver them up into
<90 hands, if he <10 make him (Amalickiah) a <160 <231 over
the whole army.

47:14 And it came to pass that <75 came down with his men and
surrounded the men of <78 so that before they awoke at the dawn
of day they were <18 by the <356 of Lehonti.

47:15 And it came to pass that when they saw that they were surrounded,
they plead with <117 that he <78 suffer them to fall in with
<110 brethren, that they <389 not be destroyed. Now this was the very
thing <359 <27 desired.

47:16 And it came to pass that he delivered his men, contrary to the
commands of the king. Now this was the <30 that <30 desired,
that he <47 accomplish his designs in dethroning the <19

47:17 Now it was the custom among the <458 if <72 chief <154
was killed, to appoint the <162 <8 to be <13 <13 leader.

47:18 And it came to pass that <52 <454 that one of his
servants <402 administer poison by degrees to <279 that he died.

47:19 Now, when <186 was dead, the Lamanites appointed <30 to
be <47 <51 and <3 <50 commander.

47:20 And it came to pass that <20 marched with his <187 (for
he had gained his desires) to the land of Nephi, to the city of <5
<156 was the <38 city.

47:21 And the king came out to meet him with his guards, for he
supposed that <48 had fulfilled his commands, and that
<8 had gathered together so great an army to go against the
Nephites to battle.

47:22 But behold, as the king came out to meet him <30 <136
that his <134 <134 go forth to meet the <188 And they went and
bowed themselves <303 the king, as if to reverence him because of his
greatness.

47:23 And it came to pass that the king put <38 his hand to raise
them, as was the <223 with the <223 as a token of peace, <128
<11 they had taken from the Nephites.

47:24 And it came to pass that when he had raised the first from the
ground, behold he stabbed the king to the heart; and he fell to the
earth.

47:25 Now the <110 of the king fled; and the <7 of <124
<39 a cry, saying:

47:26 Behold, the <14 of the king have <45 him to the heart,
and he has fallen and they have <35 <164 come and see.

47:27 And it came to pass that <45 commanded that his <255
<169 march <131 and see what had happened to the king; and when they
had come to the spot, and found the king lying in his gore, <34
pretended to be wroth, and said: Whosoever loved the <192 let him go
forth, and pursue his <87 that they may be slain.

47:28 And it came to pass that all they who <30 the <30 when they
heard these words, came <75 and pursued after the <34 of the
<249

47:29 Now when the <12 of the king saw an army pursuing <22
<227 they were frightened again, and fled into the wilderness, and
came over into the land of Zarahemla and joined the people of Ammon.

47:30 And the army <246 <58 <36 them returned, having <5
<6 them in vain; and thus Amalickiah, by his fraud, <406 the
hearts of the people.

47:31 And it came to pass on the morrow he entered the city Nephi with
his armies, and took possession of the <421

47:32 And now it came to pass that the queen, when she had <131 that
the king was slain—for <183 had sent an embassy to the queen
informing her that the king had been slain by his servants, that he had
<93 them with his army, but it was in vain, and they had made their
escape—

47:33 Therefore, when the <41 had received this message she sent unto
<118 desiring him that he would spare the <150 of the city;
and she also desired him that he <288 come in unto her; and she also
<13 him that he <13 bring witnesses with him to testify
concerning the death of the <228

47:34 And it came to pass that <114 took the same servant that
slew the <265 and all them who were with him, and went in unto the
<148 unto the place where she sat; and they all testified unto her
that the king was <139 by his own servants; and they said also: They
have <399 does not this <75 against them?  And thus they satisfied
the <133 <84 the <84 of the <84

47:35 And it came to pass that <84 sought the favor of the
<68 and took her unto him to wife; and thus by his <275 and by the
assistance of his cunning <207 he obtained the kingdom; yea, he
was acknowledged king throughout all the land, among all the <179 of
the Lamanites, who were composed of the Lamanites and the Lemuelites
and the Ishmaelites, and all the dissenters of the Nephites, from the
reign of <308 down to the present time.

47:36 Now <422 dissenters, <357 the same instruction and the same
information of the <30 yea, <13 been instructed in the same
knowledge of the Lord, nevertheless, it is strange to relate, not long
<387 <283 dissensions they became more hardened and impenitent, and
more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites—drinking in with the
traditions of the Lamanites; giving way to indolence, and all manner of
lasciviousness; yea, entirely forgetting the Lord <41 God.

Alma Chapter 48

48:1 And now it came to pass that, as soon as <186 had <158
the kingdom he began to inspire the <449 of the <144 <227 the
<158 of Nephi; yea, he did appoint men to speak unto the <16
from <55 towers, <20 the Nephites.

48:2 And thus he did <37 <14 <37 <14 the <137
insomuch that in the latter end of the nineteenth year of the <177 of
the judges, he <155 accomplished his designs thus far, yea, <7
been made king over the <221 he <272 also to <25 over all the
<239 yea, and all the <82 who were in the <10 the Nephites as
well as the Lamanites.

48:3 Therefore he had <49 his design, for he had <185 the
<82 of the <103 and blinded <89 minds, and stirred them up to
anger, <92 that he had gathered together a numerous host to go to
battle <110 the <124

48:4 For he was determined, because of the greatness of the number of
his people, to overpower the <77 and to <480 them into bondage.

48:5 And thus he did <175 chief captains of the Zoramites, they
being the most acquainted with the strength of the <165 and <82
places of resort, and the weakest parts of <10 cities; therefore he
appointed them to be <37 <37 over his armies.

48:6 And it came to pass that they took <26 camp, and moved forth
toward the land of Zarahemla in the wilderness.

48:7 Now it came to pass that while <279 had thus been obtaining
power by fraud and deceit, Moroni, on the other hand, had been
preparing the minds of the <203 to be faithful unto the Lord <56
God.

48:8 Yea, he had been strengthening the armies of the <110 and
erecting small forts, or <113 of resort; throwing up banks of earth
round about to enclose his armies, and also building walls of stone to
encircle them about, <17 <17 <51 cities and the borders of <6
lands; yea, all <13 <13 the land.

48:9 And in <15 <158 fortifications he did place the greater
<215 of men; and thus he did fortify and strengthen the land which
was possessed by the <248

48:10 And thus he was <120 to support <39 liberty, <2 lands,
<3 wives, and <3 children, and <3 peace, and that they might
live unto the Lord <11 God, and that they <11 maintain that <48
was called by <13 enemies the cause of Christians.

48:11 And Moroni was a strong and a mighty man; he was a man of a
perfect understanding; yea, a man that did not delight in bloodshed; a
man whose soul did joy in the liberty and the freedom of his country,
and his brethren from bondage and slavery;

48:12 Yea, a man <28 heart did swell with thanksgiving to his God,
for the many privileges and blessings <89 he bestowed upon his
people; a man who did labor exceedingly for the welfare and safety of
his people.

48:13 Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ, and he
had sworn with an oath to defend his <411 his rights, and his
<89 and his religion, even to the loss of his blood.

48:14 Now the <430 were taught to <29 themselves <461 <165
enemies, even to the shedding of blood if it were necessary; yea, and
they were also <24 never to give an offense, yea, and <7 to raise
the sword except it were <37 an enemy, <6 it were to preserve
<45 lives.

48:15 And this was <9 faith, that by so doing God would prosper them
in the land, or in <398 words, if they were <390 in keeping the
commandments of God that he <24 <24 them in the land; yea, warn
them to flee, or to prepare for war, according to <50 danger;

48:16 And also, that God <29 make it known unto them whither they
should go to <129 <129 <92 <25 <128 and by so doing,
the Lord <24 deliver them; and this was the <189 of <478 and his
<247 did glory in it; not in the <153 of <153 but in <105 good,
in preserving his <200 yea, in <96 the <95 of God, yea,
and resisting iniquity.

48:17 Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and
were, and ever <66 be, like unto <61 behold, the very powers of
hell <12 have been shaken forever; yea, the devil <8 <198 have
power over the hearts of the children of men.

48:18 Behold, he was a man like unto Ammon, the son of Mosiah, yea, and
even the <188 sons of <9 yea, and also Alma and his sons, for
they were all men of God.

48:19 Now <73 Helaman and his <395 were no less serviceable
unto the people than was Moroni; for they did preach the word of God,
and they did baptize unto repentance all men whosoever <92 hearken
unto <191 words.

48:20 And thus they went forth, and the <39 did humble <209
because of <20 <270 insomuch that they were highly favored of the
Lord, and thus they were free from wars and contentions among
themselves, yea, even for the space of four years.

48:21 But, as I have said, in the latter end of the nineteenth year,
yea, notwithstanding <52 peace amongst <32 they were
compelled reluctantly to contend with <12 brethren, the Lamanites.

48:22 Yea, and in fine, <12 wars <193 did cease for the <55 of
many years with the Lamanites, <40 <16 much reluctance.

48:23 Now, they were sorry to take up arms <319 the <19
<113 they did not delight in the <299 of blood; yea, and this
was not all—they were <27 to be the means of sending so many of <47
<195 out of this world into an eternal world, unprepared to meet
<15 God.

48:24 Nevertheless, they could not suffer to lay down <14 lives, that
<4 wives and <3 <282 <394 be massacred by the barbarous
cruelty of those who were once <15 <126 yea, and had dissented
from <8 church, and had left them and had gone to destroy them by
joining the <147

48:25 Yea, they <59 not bear that <27 <85 <50 rejoice over
the <411 of the Nephites, so long as there were any who <16 keep
the <412 of God, for the promise of the Lord was, if they
<17 keep his <16 they <5 prosper in the land.

Alma Chapter 49

49:1 And now it came to pass in the eleventh month of the <245
<246 on the tenth day of the month, the armies of the Lamanites were
seen approaching towards the land of Ammonihah.

49:2 And <379 the city had been rebuilt, and Moroni had stationed an
army by the borders of the city, and they had cast up dirt around about
to shield them from the arrows and the stones of the Lamanites; for
<42 they fought with <10 and with arrows.

49:3 <474 I said that the city of Ammonihah had been rebuilt. I say
unto you, yea, that it was in part rebuilt; and <288 the <95
had destroyed it once <8 of the iniquity of the people, they
supposed that it <443 again become an easy prey for them.

49:4 But <69 how great was <211 disappointment; for <7 the
Nephites had dug up a ridge of earth round <104 them, which was so
high that the <59 <240 not cast <28 <98 and <3 <114 at
them that they might take effect, neither <17 they come upon them
save it was by <21 place of entrance.

49:5 Now at this time the chief captains of the <45 were
astonished exceedingly, <103 of the wisdom of the <74 in
preparing <32 places of security.

49:6 Now the leaders of the <28 had supposed, <26 of the
greatness of <22 numbers, yea, they <130 that they <284 be
privileged to come upon them as they had hitherto done; yea, and they
had also prepared themselves with shields, and with breastplates; and
they had also <12 <12 with garments of skins, yea, very
thick <7 to cover <51 nakedness.

49:7 And being thus <22 they <58 that they <58 easily
overpower and subject <20 <388 to the yoke of bondage, or slay
and massacre them according to <15 pleasure.

49:8 But <196 to <9 uttermost astonishment, they were <40
for <193 in a manner <196 never had been known among the <480 of
Lehi. Now they were <21 for the Lamanites, to battle after the
<24 of the instructions of Moroni.

49:9 And it came to pass that the <23 or the Amalickiahites,
were exceedingly <188 at <61 <27 of preparation for war.

49:10 Now, if king Amalickiah had come down out of the land of Nephi,
at the head of his army, perhaps he <311 have caused the <201 to
have attacked the <224 at the city of Ammonihah; for <112 he did
care not for the blood of his people.

49:11 But <17 <54 did not come down himself to battle. And
<11 his <276 <276 durst not attack the <43 at the city of
Ammonihah, for <463 had altered the management of affairs <144 the
Nephites, insomuch that the <71 were disappointed in <111 <289
of retreat and they <338 not come upon <394

49:12 Therefore they retreated into the wilderness, and took <24 camp
and marched towards the land of Noah, supposing that to be the next
best <362 for them to come against the Nephites.

49:13 For they knew not that <77 had fortified, or had built forts
of security, for every city in all the land <435 about; therefore,
they <53 forward to the land of Noah with a firm determination;
yea, <70 <127 <127 came <16 and took an oath that they <184
destroy the people of that city.

49:14 But <152 to <26 <291 the city of <92 <286 had
<378 been a weak place, had now, by the means of Moroni, become
strong, yea, even to exceed the strength of the city Ammonihah.

49:15 And now, <42 this was <459 in Moroni; for he had <374
that they <68 be frightened at the city <243 and as the city of
Noah had <59 been the weakest part of the land, therefore they
<26 march thither to battle; and thus it was <391 to his
desires.

49:16 And <58 <160 had appointed Lehi to be <130 captain over
the men of that city; and it was that same Lehi who fought with the
<249 in the valley on the east of the river Sidon.

49:17 And now behold it came to pass, that when the <25 had found
that Lehi commanded the city they were again disappointed, for they
feared Lehi exceedingly; nevertheless <170 <66 <196 had sworn
with an oath to <328 the <69 <225 they brought up <17
armies.

49:18 Now <97 the <47 <311 not get into <15 <258 of
security by any other way save by the entrance, because of the highness
of the bank <217 had been thrown up, and the depth of the ditch <11
had been dug <283 about, save it were by the entrance.

49:19 And thus were the <401 prepared to <271 all such as should
attempt to climb up to enter the fort by any <65 way, by casting over
stones and arrows at <393

49:20 Thus they were prepared, yea, a body of <95 strongest men, with
<5 swords and <3 slings, to smite down all who <50 <49 to
come into <13 <397 of <115 by the <5 of entrance; and thus
were they <76 to defend themselves <409 the Lamanites.

49:21 And it came to pass that the <178 of the <156 <169 up
<39 armies before the <37 of <149 and began to contend with
the <499 to get into <18 <15 of security; but <185 they
were driven back from time to time, insomuch that they were slain with
an immense slaughter.

49:22 Now when they <255 that they <212 not obtain power over the
<162 by the <274 they <57 to dig down <51 banks of earth that
they might <22 a pass to <12 armies, that they <9 have an equal
chance to fight; but <71 in these attempts they were swept off by
the <182 and <182 <231 were <241 at them; and instead of filling
up <38 ditches by pulling down the <55 of earth, they were filled
up in a measure with <18 dead and wounded bodies.

49:23 Thus the <88 had all <95 over <16 enemies; and thus the
<163 did <205 to <262 the <17 until <14 <354
<177 were all slain; yea, and more than a thousand of the <23
were <12 while, on the <272 hand, there was not a single soul of
the <35 <93 was slain.

49:24 There were about fifty who were wounded, who had been exposed to
the <115 of the <43 through the <165 but they were shielded by
<68 shields, and <3 breastplates, and <3 head-plates, <210
that <5 wounds were upon <4 legs, many of <53 were very severe.

49:25 And it came to <38 that when the <45 saw that <23 <106
<106 were all <242 they fled into the wilderness. And it came to
pass that they returned to the land of Nephi, to inform <28 king,
Amalickiah, who was a Nephite by birth, concerning <11 great loss.

49:26 And it came to pass that he was exceedingly angry with his
people, <475 he had not obtained his desire over the Nephites; he
had not subjected them to the yoke of bondage.

49:27 Yea, he was <34 wroth, and he did curse God, and also
Moroni, swearing with an oath that he would drink his blood; and this
<52 Moroni had kept the commandments of God in preparing for the
safety of his people.

49:28 And it came to <144 that on the <225 <225 the people of Nephi
did thank the Lord <113 God, <42 of his matchless <280 in
delivering them from the hands of <15 enemies.

49:29 And thus ended the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges
over the <44 of Nephi.

49:30 Yea, and <279 was continual peace among them, and <116
<166 prosperity in the church <57 of <46 heed and diligence
<237 they gave unto the word of God, <8 was declared unto them by
Helaman, and Shiblon, and Corianton, and Ammon and his brethren, yea,
and by all those who had been ordained by the holy order of God, being
baptized unto repentance, and sent forth to preach <68 the <143

Alma Chapter 50

50:1 And now it came to pass that <176 did not stop making
preparations for war, or to defend his <114 against the Lamanites;
for he caused that his armies should commence in the commencement of
the twentieth year of the <144 of the judges, that they <18
<19 in digging up heaps of earth round <404 all the cities,
throughout all the land <124 was possessed by the Nephites.

50:2 And upon the top of these ridges of <29 he <61 that <175
<43 be timbers, yea, works of timbers built up to the height of a
man, <50 <50 the cities.

50:3 And he <30 that upon <155 <26 of <26 <35 <34 be a
frame of pickets <34 upon the <12 <29 about; and they were
strong and high.

50:4 And he <34 towers to be erected that overlooked <38 <38 of
pickets, and he <14 places of security to be <39 upon <15
towers, that the stones and the arrows of the <470 could not hurt
them.

50:5 And they were prepared that they <15 cast <24 from the top
thereof, according to <280 pleasure and <3 strength, and slay him
who <95 attempt to approach near the walls of the city.

50:6 Thus <229 did prepare strongholds <219 the coming of <30
enemies, <110 <139 every city in all the land.

50:7 And it came to pass that <29 <100 that his <239 <49 go
<289 into the east wilderness; yea, and they went <9 and drove all
the <103 who were in the east wilderness into <52 own lands,
<232 were south of the land of Zarahemla.

50:8 And the land of <452 did run in a straight course from the east
sea to the west.

50:9 And it came to pass that when <77 had driven all the <59
out of the east wilderness, <54 was north of the lands of <65 own
possessions, he <100 that the inhabitants who were in the land of
Zarahemla and in the land <135 <135 <114 go <104 into the east
<38 even to the borders by the seashore, and possess the <148

50:10 And he also placed <142 on the south, in the <22 of <58
<57 and <57 them to erect fortifications that they might
secure <14 <23 and <3 <417 from the hands of <6 enemies.

50:11 And thus he cut off all the <216 of the <111 in the
east <72 yea, and also on the west, fortifying the line between
the Nephites and the Lamanites, <7 the land of <107 and the
land of Nephi, from the west sea, running by the head of the river
Sidon—the <28 possessing all the land northward, yea, even all the
land <162 was northward of the land Bountiful, <314 to <83
pleasure.

50:12 Thus Moroni, with his armies, <21 did increase daily because of
the assurance of protection <11 his <390 did bring <167 unto them,
did seek to cut off the strength and the power of the <111 from
off the <215 of <51 <156 that they <196 have no <17 upon
the <13 of <13 possession.

50:13 And it came to pass that the <98 began the foundation of a
city, and they called the name of the city Moroni; and it was by the
east sea; and it was on the <330 by the line of the possessions of the
Lamanites.

50:14 And they also <47 a <47 for a city <176 the city of
<319 and the city of Aaron, joining the <252 of Aaron and <55
and they <65 the name of the <73 or the land, Nephihah.

50:15 And they also <44 in that same year to build many cities on the
north, one in a particular manner <164 they <37 Lehi, <4 was in
the <365 by the <55 of the seashore.

50:16 And thus ended the twentieth year.

50:17 And in these prosperous circumstances were the <312 of <435 in
the commencement of the twenty and first year of the reign of the
judges over the <22 of Nephi.

50:18 And they did prosper exceedingly, and they became exceedingly
rich; yea, and they did multiply and wax strong in the <397

50:19 And thus we see how merciful and just are all the dealings of the
Lord, to the fulfilling of all his words unto the children of men; yea,
we can behold that his <13 are verified, even at this time, <130 he
spake unto <136 saying:

50:20 Blessed art thou and thy children; and they shall be blessed,
inasmuch as they <7 keep my commandments they <5 <97 in the
<83 But remember, <16 as they will not keep my <17 they
<18 be cut off from the presence of the Lord.

50:21 And we see that <169 promises have been verified to the <149
of Nephi; for it has been <339 quarrelings and <3 contentions, yea,
<4 murderings, and <3 plunderings, <2 idolatry, <2
whoredoms, and <4 abominations, <102 were among themselves, <4
brought upon them <11 wars and <3 destructions.

50:22 And those who were faithful in keeping the <82 of the
Lord were delivered at all times, whilst thousands of <27 wicked
brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or
to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the <370

50:23 But <182 there never was a happier time <75 the <107 of
Nephi, since the days of <5 than in the days of <508 yea, even
at this <202 in the <292 and <292 year of the <292 of the judges.

50:24 And it came to pass that the <21 and second year of the <21
of the <313 also <349 in peace; yea, and also the <19 and third
<357

50:25 And it came to pass that in the <352 of the <20 and
fourth year of the <40 of the judges, <102 would also have been
peace <103 the <103 of <381 had it not been for a contention <188
took place <16 them concerning the land of <299 and the land of
Morianton, <17 joined upon the <437 of Lehi; both of <9 were on
the <10 by the <447

50:26 For behold, the <52 who possessed the land of Morianton did
claim a part of the land of <35 therefore <79 <507 to be a warm
<68 between them, insomuch that the <31 of <27 took up
arms against <234 brethren, and they were determined by the sword to
slay them.

50:27 But <59 the <28 who <59 the land of Lehi fled to the
camp of <213 and appealed unto him for assistance; for <244 they
were not in the wrong.

50:28 And it came to pass that when the <41 of <128 who were
led by a man whose name was <11 found that the <17 of Lehi
had fled to the camp of <55 they were exceedingly fearful lest the
army of Moroni should come upon them and destroy <93

50:29 Therefore, <117 put it into <115 hearts that they <20
flee to the land <180 was northward, <3 was covered with large
bodies of water, and take possession of the land <15 was northward.

50:30 And <133 they <252 have carried this plan into effect, (which
<9 have been a cause to have been lamented) but <21 <62
being a man of much passion, <203 he was angry with one of his
maid servants, and he fell upon her and beat her much.

50:31 And it came to pass that she fled, and came over to the camp of
<133 and told <126 all things <302 the matter, and also
<6 <119 intentions to flee into the land <96

50:32 Now <75 the <171 who were in the land Bountiful, or rather
<38 feared that they <101 hearken to the words of <96 and
unite with his people, and thus he <16 obtain <142 of those
parts of the land, <146 <11 lay a foundation for serious
consequences <375 the <51 of <488 yea, <15 <8 <16
lead to the overthrow of <79 liberty.

50:33 Therefore <96 sent an army, with <12 camp, to head the
<31 of <259 to stop <11 flight into the land <100

50:34 And it came to pass that they did not head them until they had
come to the <414 of the land Desolation; and <391 they did head
<387 by the narrow pass <76 led by the sea into the land <261
yea, by the sea, on the west and on the east.

50:35 And it came to pass that the army <33 was sent by <158 <5
was led by a man <354 name was Teancum, did meet the <101 of
Morianton; and so stubborn were the <9 of <110 (being
inspired by his wickedness and his flattering words) that a battle
commenced <472 <85 in the <45 Teancum did slay <198 and
defeat his <149 and took them prisoners, and returned to the camp of
Moroni. And thus ended the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the
judges over the <61 of Nephi.

50:36 And thus were the <11 of <48 brought back. And upon
<185 covenanting to keep the peace they were restored to the land of
<92 and a union took place <82 them and the <32 of Lehi;
and they were also <24 to <34 lands.

50:37 And it came to pass that in the same year that the <28 of
Nephi had <52 <26 unto <121 that Nephihah, the second chief
judge, died, having filled the judgment-seat with perfect uprightness
before God.

50:38 Nevertheless, he had refused Alma to take <330 of <330
records and <4 <392 <156 were esteemed by Alma and his fathers to
be most sacred; <451 Alma had conferred them upon his son,
Helaman.

50:39 Behold, it came to pass that the son of Nephihah was appointed to
fill the judgment-seat, in the stead of his father; yea, he was
<16 <88 judge and governor over the <405 with an oath and
sacred ordinance to <14 righteously, and to keep the <117 and the
freedom of the <22 and to grant unto them <153 <23 privileges
to worship the Lord <8 God, yea, to support and maintain the cause
of God all his days, and to bring the wicked to justice according to
<25 crime.

50:40 Now <501 his name was Pahoran. And Pahoran did fill the seat
of his father, and did commence his <272 in the end of the <284 and
<285 year, over the <207 of <278

Alma Chapter 51

51:1 And now it came to pass in the commencement of the <31 and
fifth year of the <44 of the <315 over the <37 of Nephi, they
<232 established <129 <284 the <10 of Lehi and the <5 of
<320 concerning <96 lands, and <18 <383 the <39 and
<39 year in peace;

51:2 <250 they did not long <137 an entire <38 in the
land, for <498 began to be a contention among the <44 <41
the <206 <192 Pahoran; for <136 <17 were a part of the <15
who desired that a few particular points of the law should be altered.

51:3 But <27 <158 would not alter nor suffer the law to be
altered; therefore, he did not hearken to <313 who had sent in <98
voices with <4 petitions <64 the altering of the law.

51:4 Therefore, <22 who were desirous that the law <56 be altered
were angry with him, and <74 that he <12 no longer be <95
<96 over the land; <349 <97 arose a warm dispute <46
the matter, but not unto bloodshed.

51:5 And it came to pass that <53 who were <53 that <98
<41 be dethroned from the <424 were called king-men, for
they were <17 that the law <17 be <70 in a manner to
overthrow the free government and to establish a king over the land.

51:6 And <49 who were <32 that <49 <31 remain <87 <86
over the land took upon them the name of freemen; and thus was the
division <207 <501 for the freemen had sworn or covenanted to
<233 <154 rights and the <387 of <6 religion by a free
government.

51:7 And it came to pass that this matter of <20 <247 was
settled by the voice of the people. And it came to pass that the <11
of the <250 came in favor of the freemen, and <90 retained the
<491 which caused much rejoicing <77 the brethren of
<14 and also many of the <28 of liberty, who also put the
king-men to silence, that they durst not oppose but were obliged to
<98 the <468 of freedom.

51:8 Now <146 who were in <60 of kings were <8 of high birth, and
they sought to be kings; and they were supported by <16 who <11
power and authority over the <104

51:9 But <328 this was a critical time for such contentions to be
<93 the <84 of Nephi; for <18 Amalickiah had again stirred up
the hearts of the <15 of the Lamanites against the <6 of the
Nephites, and he was gathering together soldiers from all parts of his
<425 and arming <212 and preparing for war with all diligence; for he
had <219 to drink the blood of Moroni.

51:10 But <61 we shall see that his promise <171 he made was rash;
nevertheless, he did prepare himself and his armies to come to battle
<72 the Nephites.

51:11 Now his <15 were not so great as they had hitherto been,
because of the many thousands who had been slain by the hand of the
Nephites; but notwithstanding <263 <26 loss, <127 had gathered
<106 a wonderfully <9 army, insomuch that he feared not to come
down to the land of Zarahemla.

51:12 Yea, even <29 did <81 come down, at the head of the
Lamanites. And it was in the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the
judges; and it was at the same time that they had begun to settle the
affairs of <77 <213 <474 the <401 judge, Pahoran.

51:13 And it came to pass that when the men who were <462 <305
had heard that the <217 were coming down to <151 <150 <201
they were glad in <42 hearts; and they refused to take up arms, for
they were so wroth with the <55 <55 and also with the <250 of
<356 that they would not take up arms to defend <36 country.

51:14 And it came to pass that when Moroni saw this, and also saw that
the <71 were <71 into the borders of the <276 he was
exceedingly <57 <209 of the stubbornness of <354 <55 whom he
had labored with so much diligence to preserve; yea, he was <23
wroth; his soul was filled with anger <109 them.

51:15 And it came to pass that he sent a petition, with the <484 of
the people, unto the governor of the <64 desiring that he should read
it, and give him (Moroni) <415 to compel <68 dissenters to <113
<114 country or to put them to death.

51:16 For it was his first care to put an end to such <215 and
dissensions <428 the people; for <365 this had been <326 a
<498 of all <42 destruction. And it came to pass that it was granted
according to the <87 of the <478

51:17 And it came to pass that <172 commanded that his army <92 go
<127 <85 king-men, to pull down <43 pride and <3 nobility and
level them with the earth, or they <23 take up arms and support the
<68 of liberty.

51:18 And it came to pass that the <419 did march forth <46 them;
and they did pull down <45 <48 and <3 nobility, <395 that as
they did lift <9 weapons of war to fight <26 the men of <84
they were hewn down and leveled to the earth.

51:19 And it came to pass that there were four thousand of <101
<187 who were hewn down by the sword; and <11 of <49 leaders
who were not <479 in <360 were taken and cast into prison, for <34
was no time for <22 trials at this period.

51:20 And the remainder of <37 dissenters, rather than be smitten
down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of <372 and
were compelled to hoist the title of liberty upon <44 towers, and in
<5 cities, and to take up arms in defence of <10 <389

51:21 And thus <128 put an end to <59 <208 that <81 were not
any known by the appellation of king-men; and thus he put an end to the
<386 and the <180 of <28 <389 who professed the blood of
nobility; but they were brought down to humble themselves like unto
<61 brethren, and to <190 valiantly for <7 freedom from bondage.

51:22 Behold, it came to pass that while <75 was thus breaking down
the wars and <343 <340 his own <397 and subjecting them to
peace and civilization, and making regulations to prepare for war
<237 the Lamanites, <359 the <485 had come into the land of
Moroni, which was in the <493 by the seashore.

51:23 And it came to pass that the Nephites were not sufficiently
strong in the city of Moroni; therefore Amalickiah did drive them,
slaying many. And it came to pass that <13 took possession of
the city, yea, <6 of all <114 fortifications.

51:24 And <148 who fled out of the city of <114 came to the city of
Nephihah; and also the <166 of the city of Lehi gathered <158
together, and made preparations and were ready to receive the <109
to battle.

51:25 But it came to pass that <70 would not suffer the
<20 to go <137 the city of Nephihah to battle, but kept them
down by the seashore, leaving men in every city to maintain and defend
it.

51:26 And thus he went on, taking <107 of many <298 the city
of Nephihah, and the city of Lehi, and the city of Morianton, and the
city of Omner, and the city of Gid, and the city of Mulek, all of <196
were on the east <198 by the <198

51:27 And thus had the <94 obtained, by the cunning of
Amalickiah, so many <62 by <171 numberless hosts, all of <35
were strongly fortified after the manner of the fortifications of
<215 all of <16 afforded strongholds for the Lamanites.

51:28 And it came to pass that they marched to the <65 of the land
Bountiful, driving the <256 before them and <243 <243

51:29 But it came to pass that they were met by Teancum, who had <500
Morianton and had headed his <224 in his flight.

51:30 And it came to pass that he <17 <207 also, as he was
marching forth with his numerous army that he might take <178 of
the land <70 and also the land northward.

51:31 But behold he met with a disappointment by being repulsed by
Teancum and his men, for they were great warriors; for <233 man of
<14 did exceed the <168 in <158 strength and in <4 skill
of war, insomuch that they did gain advantage over the <149

51:32 And it came to pass that they did harass <381 <23 that they
did slay them even until it was dark. And it came to pass that <56
and his men did pitch <53 tents in the <178 of the land Bountiful;
and <131 did <14 his <14 in the <14 on the beach by the
<329 and <232 this <232 were they driven.

51:33 And it came to pass that when the night had come, <55 and his
servant stole <167 and went out by night, and went into the camp of
Amalickiah; and behold, sleep had overpowered them because of <76
much fatigue, <274 was caused by the labors and heat of the day.

51:34 And it came to pass that <53 <49 privily into the tent of
the king, and put a javelin to his heart; and he did cause the death of
the king immediately that he did not awake his servants.

51:35 And he returned again <41 to his own camp, and <81 his
men were asleep, and he awoke them and told them all the things that he
had done.

51:36 And he <95 that his armies should stand in readiness, lest the
<247 had awakened and <11 come upon them.

51:37 And thus endeth the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the
judges over the <353 of Nephi; and thus <20 the days of
Amalickiah.

Alma Chapter 52

52:1 And now, it came to pass in the <42 and sixth year of the <42
of the <42 over the <42 of Nephi, <112 when the <77
<109 on the first morning of the <4 month, <14 they found
<269 was dead in his own tent; and they also saw that <191 was
ready to give them battle on that day.

52:2 And now, when the <46 saw this they were affrighted; and
they abandoned <245 design in <438 into the land northward, and
retreated with all <13 army into the city of Mulek, and sought
protection in <12 fortifications.

52:3 And it came to pass that the brother of <81 was appointed
king over the people; and his name was Ammoron; thus king Ammoron, the
<20 of king Amalickiah, was <21 to <134 in his stead.

52:4 And it came to pass that he did command that his <146 <214
maintain those cities, <331 they had taken by the shedding of blood;
for they had not <11 any cities save they had lost much blood.

52:5 And now, <148 saw that the <133 were determined to
<41 <41 <24 <41 they had taken, and <7 parts of the land
<11 they had obtained possession of; and also seeing the enormity of
<130 number, <38 thought it was not expedient that he <80
attempt to attack them in <17 forts.

52:6 But he kept his men round about, as if making preparations for
war; yea, and truly he was preparing to defend himself against them, by
casting up walls <25 about and <14 places of resort.

52:7 And it came to pass that he kept thus <17 for war until
Moroni had sent a large number of men to strengthen his army.

52:8 And <17 also sent orders unto him that he <93 retain all the
prisoners who fell into his hands; for as the <149 had <170 many
prisoners, that he <22 <22 all the <21 of the <15 as
a ransom for <157 whom the <9 had taken.

52:9 And he also sent <54 unto him that he <32 fortify the land
Bountiful, and secure the narrow pass <181 led into the land
<322 lest the <36 <21 obtain that point and <5 have
power to harass them on every side.

52:10 And <103 also sent unto him, desiring him that he would be
faithful in maintaining that quarter of the land, and that he <14
seek <33 opportunity to scourge the <52 in that quarter, as
much as was in his power, that perhaps he might take again by stratagem
or some other way <116 <280 <88 had been <140 out of <245 <150
and that he also <48 <112 and <185 the <19 <222 <247
<22 had not fallen into the hands of the Lamanites.

52:11 And he also said unto him, I <30 come unto you, but <504 the
<78 are upon us in the borders of the land by the west sea; and
<19 I go <280 <280 therefore I cannot come unto you.

52:12 Now, the king (Ammoron) had departed out of the land of
Zarahemla, and had made known unto the queen concerning the death of
his brother, and had gathered together a <288 <288 of men, and had
marched forth <53 the Nephites on the <71 by the west sea.

52:13 And thus he was endeavoring to <211 the Nephites, and to draw
away a part of <148 forces to that part of the <200 while he had
commanded <169 whom he had left to possess the <157 <154 he had
<457 that they <256 also <42 the <62 on the <62 by the
east sea, and <14 take <464 of <47 lands as much as it was
in <9 <227 according to the <285 of <7 armies.

52:14 And thus were the <40 in <62 dangerous circumstances in
the ending of the twenty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi.

52:15 But <192 it came to pass in the <28 and seventh year of the
<29 of the judges, that Teancum, by the command of Moroni—who had
established armies to protect the south and the west <105 of the
<138 and had begun his march towards the land <402 that he <323
assist Teancum with his men in retaking the <146 <146 they had lost—

52:16 And it came to pass that <22 had received <443 to make an
attack upon the city of Mulek, and retake it if it were possible.

52:17 And it came to pass that <31 made preparations to make an
<30 upon the city of <30 and <77 <260 with his army <263
the Lamanites; but he saw that it was impossible that he could
overpower them <241 they were in <190 fortifications; <337 he
abandoned his designs and returned <427 to the city <113 to wait
for the coming of Moroni, that he <121 receive strength to his army.

52:18 And it came to pass that <506 did arrive with his army at the
land of <38 in the latter end of the <200 and <200 year of
the <200 of the <229 over the <228 of <228

52:19 And in the commencement of the <26 and eighth year, <48 and
<132 and many of the chief captains held a council of war—what they
<316 do to cause the <467 to come out <136 them to battle; or
that they <98 by some means flatter them out of <131 strongholds,
that they <13 gain advantage over them and take <133 the city of
Mulek.

52:20 And it came to pass they sent embassies to the army of the
Lamanites, <253 protected the city of <201 to <44 leader, whose
name was Jacob, desiring him that he would come out with his <311 to
meet them upon the plains between the two cities. But <352 <24
who was a Zoramite, <25 not come out with his army to meet them upon
the plains.

52:21 And it came to pass that <213 having no hopes of meeting them
upon fair grounds, therefore, he resolved upon a plan that he <118
decoy the <147 out of <86 strongholds.

52:22 Therefore he caused that <179 <166 take a small number of
men and <307 down near the seashore; and <198 and his army, by
night, marched in the wilderness, on the west of the city Mulek; and
thus, on the morrow, when the guards of the <58 had discovered
<449 they ran and told it unto <122 <67 leader.

52:23 And it came to pass that the <150 of the <28 did <65
<373 <234 <30 supposing by <25 numbers to <362 <86
because of the smallness of his numbers. And as <11 saw the <30
of the <31 <356 out <29 him he began to retreat down by the
seashore, northward.

52:24 And it came to pass that when the <27 saw that he <25 to
flee, they took courage and pursued them with vigor. And <423 <52
was thus leading away the <25 who were pursuing them in vain,
<231 <149 commanded that a part of his army who were with him
<177 <104 <103 into the city, and take possession of it.

52:25 And thus they did, and slew all those who had been left to
protect the <26 yea, all <12 who <274 not yield up <136 weapons
of war.

52:26 And thus <64 had obtained <46 of the city Mulek with a
part of his <224 <96 he <223 with the remainder to meet the
<98 when they <79 return from the pursuit of Teancum.

52:27 And it came to pass that the <21 did pursue <129 until
they came near the city <505 and then they were met by Lehi and a
<293 <55 <402 had been left to <97 the city Bountiful.

52:28 And now <150 when the <491 <491 of the <46 had
beheld Lehi with his army <224 <223 them, they fled in much
confusion, lest perhaps they <84 not obtain the city <110 before
Lehi <9 overtake them; for they were wearied <269 of <141
march, and the men of Lehi were fresh.

52:29 Now the <54 did not know that <151 had been in <25 rear
with his army; and all they feared was Lehi and his men.

52:30 Now Lehi was not desirous to <58 them till they <63 meet
<36 and his army.

52:31 And it came to pass that <83 the <57 had retreated far
they were surrounded by the Nephites, by the men of <31 on one hand,
and the men of Lehi on the other, all of whom were fresh and full of
strength; but the <40 were <118 <118 of <93 long march.

52:32 And <38 <320 his men that they <78 fall upon them
<217 they had given up <24 <283 of war.

52:33 And it came to pass that <459 being <16 leader, <3 also a
Zoramite, and having an unconquerable spirit, he led the <60
<354 to battle with exceeding fury <210 Moroni.

52:34 <61 <28 in <32 course of <191 therefore Jacob was
determined to slay them and cut his way through to the city of Mulek.
But <259 <28 and his men were more powerful; <28 they did
not give way <158 the Lamanites.

52:35 And it came to pass that they fought on both hands with <69
fury; and there were many slain on both sides; yea, and <46 was
wounded and <71 was killed.

52:36 And Lehi pressed upon <87 rear with such fury with his strong
men, that the <116 in the rear delivered up <18 <153 of war;
and the <412 of <332 <117 much confused, knew not whither to go
or to strike.

52:37 Now <61 seeing <29 <347 he said unto them: If ye will
bring <160 your <41 of war and deliver them up, behold we will
forbear shedding your blood.

52:38 And it came to pass that when the <75 had heard these
words, <46 <413 captains, all those who were not slain, came <45
and threw down <15 <49 of war at the feet of Moroni, and also
<270 <13 men that they <270 do the same.

52:39 But <197 <160 were many that would not; and <45 who <5
not <83 up <28 swords were taken and bound, and <7 <48 of
war were <10 from <137 and they were compelled to march with <16
brethren <72 into the land <508

52:40 And now the number of prisoners who were <30 exceeded more than
the <11 of <58 who had been <103 yea, more than <8 who had
been <235 on both sides.

Alma Chapter 53

53:1 And it came to pass that they did set guards over the <50 of
the Lamanites, and did compel them to go <75 and bury <81 dead,
yea, and also the dead of the Nephites who were slain; and <223
placed men over them to guard them while they <154 perform <28
labors.

53:2 And <21 went to the city of Mulek with Lehi, and took command
of the city and gave it unto Lehi. Now <177 this Lehi was a man who
had been with <33 in the more part of all his battles; and he was a
man like unto <223 and they rejoiced in each other’s safety; yea,
they were beloved by each other, and also <6 by all the people of
Nephi.

53:3 And it came to pass that after the <290 had finished burying
<101 dead and also the dead of the Nephites, they were marched back
into the land Bountiful; and Teancum, by the orders of <67 caused
that they <132 commence laboring in digging a ditch round about the
land, or the city, <247

53:4 And he <26 that they <25 build a breastwork of timbers upon
the inner bank of the ditch; and they cast up dirt out of the <41
against the <23 of timbers; and thus they did cause the
<95 to labor until they had encircled the city of Bountiful <65
<66 with a <481 wall of <50 and earth, to an exceeding height.

53:5 And this city became an <11 stronghold ever after; and in
this city they did <243 the <281 of the Lamanites; yea, even
within a wall which they had <100 them to <99 with <156 own hands.
Now <221 was <377 to <78 the <77 to labor, because it
was easy to <40 them <283 at <24 labor; and he desired all his
forces when he <137 make an attack upon the Lamanites.

53:6 And it came to pass that <47 had thus gained a victory over one
of the greatest of the armies of the <364 and had obtained
possession of the city of Mulek, <88 was one of the strongest holds
of the <79 in the land of Nephi; and thus he had also built a
<134 to retain his prisoners.

53:7 And it came to pass that he did no more attempt a battle with the
<39 in that year, but he did employ his men in preparing for war,
yea, and in making fortifications to <130 <229 the <84 yea,
and also delivering <135 women and <3 children from famine and
affliction, and providing food for <11 armies.

53:8 And now it came to pass that the <121 of the <37 on the
west sea, south, <175 in the absence of <150 on account of some
intrigue amongst the <359 <132 <218 dissensions <6 them,
had <164 some ground over the <13 yea, insomuch that they had
<159 <158 of a number of <64 cities in that part of the
land.

53:9 And thus <238 of iniquity <40 themselves, yea, <6 of
<47 and <55 among themselves they were placed in the most
dangerous circumstances.

53:10 And now <508 I have somewhat to say concerning the <466 of
Ammon, who in the beginning, were <313 but by Ammon and his
brethren, or rather by the power and word of God, they had been
converted unto the Lord; and they had been brought down into the land
of Zarahemla, and had ever since been protected by the Nephites.

53:11 And <91 of <114 oath they had been kept from taking up arms
<211 <12 brethren; for they had taken an oath that they never
would shed blood more; and according to <19 oath they <10 have
perished; yea, they <6 have suffered <129 to have fallen into
the hands of <21 <99 had it not been for the pity and the
<446 love <205 <117 and his brethren had had for them.

53:12 And for this <424 they were <109 down into the land of
Zarahemla; and they ever had been <109 by the <109

53:13 But it came to pass that when they saw the danger, and the many
afflictions and tribulations <58 the Nephites bore for <264 they
were moved with compassion and were desirous to take up arms in the
defence of <96 country.

53:14 But <225 as they were about to take <14 weapons of war, they
were overpowered by the persuasions of Helaman and his <124 for
they were <23 to break the oath <63 they had made.

53:15 And <22 feared lest by so doing they should lose <43 souls;
therefore all those who had entered into this covenant were compelled
to behold <17 <153 wade through <4 afflictions, in <3
<309 circumstances at this time.

53:16 But <86 it came to pass they had many sons, who had not
<41 into a <41 that they <220 not take <34 <101 of war
to defend <227 <260 <9 enemies; <66 they did assemble
<9 together at this time, as many as were able to take up arms,
and they called <18 <197

53:17 And they <51 into a <51 to fight for the liberty of the
<444 yea, to protect the land unto the laying down of <56 lives;
yea, even they covenanted that they <315 <78 give up <13 liberty,
but they <8 <37 in all cases to <32 the <228 and
<60 from bondage.

53:18 Now <124 there were two thousand of <161 young men, who
<71 into this <71 and took <41 <119 of war to <118
<7 <241

53:19 And now <32 as they <63 had hitherto been a disadvantage to
the <92 they became now at this period of time also a great
support; for they took <37 <44 of war, and they <86 that
<239 <233 be <12 leader.

53:20 And they were all <76 men, and they were exceedingly valiant
for courage, and also for strength and activity; but <68 this was
not all—they were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing
they were entrusted.

53:21 Yea, they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been
taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before
him.

53:22 And now it came to pass that <93 did march at the head of his
two <169 stripling soldiers, to the support of the people in the
borders of the land on the south by the west sea.

53:23 And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the
judges over the <36 of Nephi.

Alma Chapter 54

54:1 And now it came to pass in the commencement of the <37 and
ninth year of the judges, that Ammoron sent unto Moroni desiring that
he <191 exchange prisoners.

54:2 And it came to pass that <18 felt to rejoice <187 at
this request, for he desired the provisions <463 were imparted for the
<113 of the Lamanite prisoners for the <7 of his own people;
and he also <25 his own <93 for the strengthening of his army.

54:3 Now the Lamanites had taken many women and children, and <330 was
not a woman nor a child among all the <48 of Moroni, or the
<6 whom <80 had taken; <445 <4 resolved upon a
stratagem to obtain as many <16 of the <379 from the
<49 as it were possible.

54:4 Therefore he wrote an epistle, and sent it by the servant of
Ammoron, the same who had brought an epistle to Moroni. Now these are
the words <125 he <29 unto <20 saying:

54:5 Behold, <7 I have written unto you somewhat concerning this
war <22 ye have waged against my people, or rather <9 thy brother
hath <11 <11 them, and <9 ye are still determined to carry on
after his death.

54:6 <46 I <210 tell you <44 <44 the justice of God,
and the sword of his almighty wrath, <35 doth hang over you except ye
repent and withdraw your armies into your own lands, or the land of
your possessions, <24 is the land of <295

54:7 Yea, I <53 tell you <119 things if ye were capable of
hearkening unto them; yea, I <16 tell you <68 that awful hell
that awaits to receive such murderers as thou and thy <112 have
been, <69 ye <68 and <68 your murderous purposes, and return
with your <75 to your own lands.

54:8 But as ye have once rejected <63 things, and have fought <145
the <285 of the Lord, even so I may expect you will do it again.

54:9 And now behold, we are prepared to <72 you; yea, and <65
you <64 your <63 <15 ye will pull down the wrath of that
God whom you have <58 upon you, even to your utter destruction.

54:10 But, as the Lord liveth, our <90 shall come upon you <43 ye
withdraw, and ye <10 soon be visited with death, for we will retain
our cities and our lands; yea, and we will maintain our religion and
the cause of our God.

54:11 But <78 it supposeth me that I talk to you <177 <131
<195 in vain; or it <15 me that thou art a <392 of hell;
<381 I will close my <339 by telling you that I will not
<490 prisoners, save it be on conditions that ye will deliver up a
man and his wife and his <440 for one prisoner; if this be the
case that ye will do it, I will exchange.

54:12 And <84 if you do not this, I will come <209 you with my
armies; yea, even I will arm my <486 and my <47 and I will come
<21 you, and I will follow you even into your own land, <325 is
the land of our first inheritance; yea, and it <173 be blood for
blood, yea, life for life; and I will give you battle even until you
are destroyed from off the face of the earth.

54:13 <413 I am in my anger, and also my people; ye have sought to
murder us, and we have only <9 to defend ourselves. But <113 if
ye seek to destroy us more we will seek to <7 you; yea, and we
will seek our <94 the land of our <91 inheritance.

54:14 Now I <202 my epistle. I am Moroni; I am a leader of the <357
of the Nephites.

54:15 Now it came to pass that Ammoron, when he had received this
epistle, was angry; and he wrote another <241 unto Moroni, and <267
are the words <156 he wrote, saying:

54:16 I am <33 the king of the Lamanites; I am the <454 of
Amalickiah whom ye have murdered. <138 I will avenge his <174 upon
you, yea, and I will come upon you with my <373 for I fear not your
threatenings.

54:17 For <143 your fathers did wrong their brethren, insomuch that
they did rob them of <10 right to the government when it rightly
belonged unto them.

54:18 And now <33 if ye will lay down your arms, and subject
yourselves to be governed by those to whom the <34 doth <33
belong, then will I <410 that my <160 <267 lay down <53 weapons
and <7 be at war no more.

54:19 <113 ye have breathed out many threatenings <315 me and my
<254 but <63 we fear not your <107

54:20 Nevertheless, I will grant to <410 prisoners according to
your request, gladly, that I may preserve my food for my men of war;
and we will wage a war <195 <66 be eternal, either to the subjecting
the Nephites to our authority or to <85 eternal extinction.

54:21 And as <493 that God whom ye say we have rejected, <75
we know not such a being; neither do ye; but if it so be that there is
such a thing, we know not but that he hath made us as well as you.

54:22 And if it so be that <29 is a devil and a hell, behold will he
not send you <14 to dwell with my <275 whom ye have murdered, whom
ye have hinted that he hath gone to such a place? But <31 <319
things matter not.

54:23 I am <315 and a descendant of Zoram, whom your <273
pressed and brought out of Jerusalem.

54:24 And <33 now, I am a bold Lamanite; <124 this war hath been
waged to <331 <151 wrongs, and to maintain and to obtain <8
rights to the government; and I <428 my <389 to Moroni.

Alma Chapter 55

55:1 Now it came to pass that when Moroni had <421 this <24 he
was more angry, because he knew that Ammoron had a perfect knowledge of
his fraud; yea, he knew that <13 knew that it was not a just <316
that had caused him to wage a war <298 the <325 of Nephi.

55:2 And he said: <317 I will not <292 <292 with <37
save he will withdraw his purpose, as I have stated in my epistle; for
I will not <317 unto him that he <293 have any more power than what
he hath got.

55:3 <47 I know the place where the Lamanites do guard my <68
whom they have taken prisoners; and as <60 would not <43 unto me
mine epistle, <180 I will give unto him <368 to my words; yea,
I will seek death among them until they <64 sue for peace.

55:4 And now it came to pass that when <169 had said <258 words, he
<137 that a search should be made <34 his men, that perhaps he
might find a man who was a <269 of Laman <17 them.

55:5 And it came to pass that they found one, whose name was Laman; and
he was one of the servants of the king who was murdered by Amalickiah.

55:6 Now <71 <65 that <44 and a small number of his men <71
go forth unto the guards who were over the Nephites.

55:7 Now the <464 were guarded in the city of Gid; therefore <38
appointed <38 and <42 that a <40 <40 of men <39 go with
him.

55:8 And when it was evening <23 went to the <51 who were over the
Nephites, and <183 they saw him coming and they hailed him; but he
saith unto them: Fear not; <17 I am a Lamanite. <234 we have
escaped from the <31 and they sleep; and <404 we have <233 of
<386 wine and <422 with us.

55:9 Now when the <258 heard <199 words they <372 him with
joy; and they said unto him: Give us of your wine, that we may drink;
we are glad that ye have thus <48 wine with you for we are weary.

55:10 But <110 said unto <87 Let us keep of our wine till we go
<383 the <161 to battle. But this saying only made them more
desirous to drink of the wine;

55:11 For, said they: We are weary, <180 let us take of the <75
and by and by we <317 receive wine for our rations, which will
strengthen us to go <55 the <223

55:12 And <77 said unto <77 You may do <359 to your desires.

55:13 And it came to pass that they did take of the wine freely; and it
was pleasant to <169 taste, <70 they took of it more <15 and
it was strong, having been prepared in its strength.

55:14 And it came to pass they did <113 and were merry, and by and by
they were all drunken.

55:15 And now when <85 and his men saw that they were all drunken,
and were in a deep sleep, they returned to <318 and told him all the
things that had happened.

55:16 And now this was <117 to the design of Moroni. And <26
had <84 his men with weapons of war; and he went to the city Gid,
while the <273 were in a deep sleep and <64 and cast in
<25 of war unto the prisoners, insomuch that they were all armed;

55:17 Yea, even to <148 women, and all those of <6 children, as
many as were able to use a weapon of war, when <72 had armed all
<22 prisoners; and all <4 <101 were done in a profound silence.

55:18 But had they awakened the Lamanites, <371 they were drunken and
the <298 could have slain them.

55:19 But <405 this was not the desire of Moroni; he did not delight
in murder or bloodshed, but he delighted in the saving of his people
from destruction; and for this cause he might not bring upon him
injustice, he would not fall upon the <143 and destroy them in
<112 drunkenness.

55:20 But he had obtained his desires; for he had <110 <104 prisoners
of the <84 who were within the wall of the city, and had given
them power to gain possession of <24 parts <357 were <20 the
walls.

55:21 And then he caused the men who were with him to withdraw a pace
from them, and surround the armies of the Lamanites.

55:22 Now <151 this was done in the night-time, so that when the
<99 awoke in the morning they beheld that they were surrounded by
the <86 without, and that <111 <95 were <99 within.

55:23 And thus they saw that the <19 had <93 over them; and in
these circumstances they found that it was not expedient that they
should fight with the Nephites; <415 <41 chief captains demanded
<5 <295 of war, and they brought them forth and cast them at the
feet of the Nephites, pleading for mercy.

55:24 Now <237 this was the <236 of <361 He took them <82
of war, and took <162 of the <174 and <150 that all the
<16 <65 be liberated, who were <66 and they did join the
army of Moroni, and were a great strength to his army.

55:25 And it came to pass that he did <267 the <319 whom he had
taken <386 that they <46 commence a labor in strengthening the
fortifications round about the city Gid.

55:26 And it came to pass that when he had fortified the city Gid,
<465 to his desires, he <89 that his <87 <41 be <47
to the city Bountiful; and he also guarded that city with an
exceedingly strong force.

55:27 And it came to pass that they did, notwithstanding all the
intrigues of the <89 keep and protect all the <46 whom
they had taken, and also maintain all the ground and the advantage
<317 they had retaken.

55:28 And it came to pass that the <248 began again to be
victorious, and to reclaim <227 rights and <3 privileges.

55:29 Many time did the <304 attempt to encircle them <135 by
night, but in <274 attempts they did lose many prisoners.

55:30 And many times did they <26 to administer of <41 wine to
the <258 that they <455 <441 them with poison or with
<443

55:31 But <266 the <78 were not slow to remember the Lord <32
God in this <5 time of affliction. They could not be <173 in <10
snares; yea, they <491 not partake of <9 wine, save they had first
<459 to some of the Lamanite <83

55:32 And they were thus cautious that no <69 <212 be administered
among <385 for if <34 wine <40 <12 a <27 it <5 also
<7 a Nephite; and thus they did try all <19 liquors.

55:33 And now it came to pass that it was <410 for Moroni to make
preparations to attack the city Morianton; for <115 the <170
had, by <34 labors, <289 the city Morianton until it had become
an exceeding stronghold.

55:34 And they were continually bringing new forces into that <395 and
also new supplies of provisions.

55:35 And thus ended the twenty and ninth year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi.

Alma Chapter 56

56:1 And now it came to pass in the commencement of the thirtieth year
of the <36 of the judges, on the second day in the <177 month,
<115 received an epistle from Helaman, stating the affairs of the
<54 in that quarter of the land.

56:2 And <285 are the words <338 he wrote, saying: My dearly beloved
brother, <481 as well in the Lord as in the tribulations of our
warfare; <155 my <19 <18 I have somewhat to tell you
concerning our warfare in this part of the <52

56:3 Behold, two thousand of the sons of those men whom Ammon brought
down out of the land of Nephi—now ye have known that <75 were
descendants of Laman, who was the eldest son of our father Lehi;

56:4 Now I need not rehearse unto you <63 <224 traditions or
<4 unbelief, for thou knowest <10 all <38 things—

56:5 Therefore it sufficeth me that I tell you that two <76 of
<19 young men have <356 <31 weapons of war, and <310 that I
<329 be <11 leader; and we have come forth to defend our country.

56:6 And now ye also know <57 the covenant <167 <24 fathers
made, that they <36 not take up <10 <45 of war against <5
brethren to shed blood.

56:7 But in the <279 and sixth year, when they saw our afflictions
and our <190 for them, they were <508 to break the <51
<52 they had made and take up <43 <48 of war in our defence.

56:8 But I <65 not suffer them that they <103 <31 this <31
<31 they had <82 supposing that God <18 strengthen us, insomuch
that we <19 not <25 more because of the fulfilling the oath <24
they had taken.

56:9 But <261 here is one thing in <16 we may have great joy. For
<14 in the <105 and <105 <105 I, <329 did march at the head
of <186 two <191 <188 men to the city of Judea, to assist
Antipus, whom ye had appointed a leader over the <352 of that part of
the <301

56:10 And I did join my two <38 sons, (for they are worthy to be
called sons) to the army of <42 in <81 strength Antipus did
rejoice exceedingly; for <81 his army had been reduced by the
Lamanites <121 <164 <493 had slain a vast number of our men, for
<31 cause we have to mourn.

56:11 Nevertheless, we may console ourselves in this point, that they
have died in the <24 of <39 country and of <4 God, yea, and they
are happy.

56:12 And the <59 had also retained many prisoners, all of whom
are chief captains, for none other have they spared alive. And we
suppose that they are now at this time in the land of Nephi; it is so
if they are not slain.

56:13 And now <184 are the cities of <101 the <58 have obtained
possession by the shedding of the blood of so many of our valiant men:

56:14 The land of Manti, or the city of <5 and the city of Zeezrom,
and the city of Cumeni, and the city of Antiparah.

56:15 And <59 are the <59 <58 they possessed when I arrived at
the city of Judea; and I found <203 and his men toiling with <149
might to fortify the city.

56:16 Yea, and they were depressed in body as well as in spirit, for
they had fought valiantly by day and toiled by night to maintain <37
cities; and thus they had suffered <333 <424 of every kind.

56:17 And now they were determined to conquer in this place or die;
therefore you may well <183 that this little force <97 I brought
with me, yea, those sons of mine, gave them <44 hopes and much joy.

56:18 And now it came to pass that when the <184 saw that <116
had received a greater <326 to his army, they were compelled by the
orders of Ammoron to not come against the city of <395 or <6 us,
to battle.

56:19 And thus were we favored of the Lord; for had they come upon us
in this our weakness they <165 have perhaps destroyed our <98 army;
but thus were we preserved.

56:20 They were commanded by <60 to <154 <108 <214 <117
they had <501 And thus ended the <483 and <483 year. And in the
commencement of the <11 and seventh year we had prepared our city
and <390 for defence.

56:21 Now we were desirous that the <130 should come upon us; for
we were not <13 to make an attack upon them in <218 strongholds.

56:22 And it came to pass that we kept spies out round about, to watch
the movements of the Lamanites, that they <116 not pass us by <254
nor by day to make an <45 upon our <419 <108 <108 were on the
northward.

56:23 For we knew in <124 <16 they were not sufficiently strong to
meet them; <259 we were desirous, if they <94 pass by us, to
fall upon them in <87 rear, and thus bring them up in the rear at the
same time they were met in the front. We supposed that we could
overpower <45 but behold, we were disappointed in this our desire.

56:24 They durst not pass by us with <49 whole <274 neither <10
they with a part, lest they <71 not be <86 <86 and they
<8 fall.

56:25 Neither <23 they march down <284 the city of Zarahemla;
<34 <11 they cross the head of Sidon, over to the city of
Nephihah.

56:26 And thus, with <59 forces, they were <396 to <266
<143 <143 <159 they had <266

56:27 And now it came to pass in the second month of this year, there
was <406 unto us many provisions from the fathers of <35 my two
thousand sons.

56:28 And also <24 were sent two <12 men unto us from the land
of Zarahemla. And thus we were <304 with ten <17 men, and
<42 for them, and also for <86 wives and <3 children.

56:29 And the <267 thus seeing our forces increase daily, and
<26 arrive for our support, they began to be fearful, and <5
to sally forth, if it were possible to put an end to our receiving
<28 and strength.

56:30 Now when we saw that the <360 <31 to grow uneasy on this
wise, we were <361 to <264 a stratagem into effect upon <246
<292 <509 ordered that I <212 <204 forth with my <456 sons
to a neighboring city, as if we were carrying <56 to a
<11 city.

56:31 And we were to <30 near the city of Antiparah, as if we were
going to the city beyond, in the borders by the seashore.

56:32 And it came to pass that we did <34 <118 as if with our
provisions, to go to that <55

56:33 And it came to pass that <92 did <25 <89 with a part of
his <328 leaving the remainder to <270 the <28 But he did not
<21 <21 until I had gone <5 with my <115 <23 and came near
the city Antiparah.

56:34 And now, in the city Antiparah were stationed the strongest army
of the Lamanites; yea, the most numerous.

56:35 And it came to pass that when they had been informed by <252
spies, they came <56 with <7 army and marched <380 us.

56:36 And it came to pass that we did flee before <286 northward. And
thus we did lead away the most powerful army of the <63

56:37 Yea, even to a considerable distance, insomuch that when they saw
the army of <142 pursuing <37 with <59 might, they did not turn
to the right nor to the left, but pursued <16 <140 in a straight
course after us; and, as we suppose, it was <15 intent to slay us
<77 <42 <273 overtake <43 and this that they might not be
surrounded by our people.

56:38 And now Antipus, beholding our danger, did speed the <50 of his
army. But behold, it was night; <316 they did not <41 us,
neither did <48 <6 <329 <12 we did camp for the night.

56:39 And it came to pass that <69 the dawn of the morning, <39
the <375 were <120 us. Now we were not sufficiently strong to
contend with <41 yea, I would not suffer that my <251 sons <100
fall into <112 hands; <56 we did continue our march, and we took
our <89 into the wilderness.

56:40 Now they durst not turn to the <162 nor to the left lest they
<40 be surrounded; <98 <51 I turn to the <17 nor to the left
lest they <17 <110 me, and we could not stand <259 <164 but
be slain, and they <29 make <71 escape; and thus we did flee all
that day into the wilderness, even <350 it was dark.

56:41 And it came to pass that again, when the light of the morning
came we saw the <140 upon us, and we did flee <156 them.

56:42 But it came to pass that they did not pursue us far <18 they
halted; and it was in the <40 of the third day of the seventh
month.

56:43 And now, whether they were overtaken by <224 we knew not, but
I said unto my men: Behold, we know not but they have halted for the
purpose that we <139 come <133 <133 that they <295 catch us in
<132 snare;

56:44 Therefore what say ye, my sons, will ye go <24 them to
battle?

56:45 And now I say unto you, my beloved brother Moroni, that never had
I seen so great courage, nay, not amongst all the Nephites.

56:46 For as I had ever called them my sons (for they were all of them
very young) even so they said unto me: Father, behold our God is with
us, and he will not <301 that we <103 fall; then let us go forth;
we <235 not slay our brethren if they <7 let us alone; <313
let us go, lest they <27 overpower the army of Antipus.

56:47 Now they <96 had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they
did think more upon the liberty of <150 fathers than they did upon
<7 lives; yea, they had been taught by <8 mothers, that if they
did not doubt, God <67 deliver <260

56:48 And they rehearsed unto me the words of <25 <25 saying: We
do not doubt our mothers knew it.

56:49 And it came to pass that I did return with my two thousand
<205 these <313 who had pursued us. And now <463 the armies
of <270 had <274 <245 and a terrible battle had commenced.

56:50 The army of <17 being weary, because of <66 long <448 in
so short a space of time, were about to fall into the hands of the
Lamanites; and had I not returned with my two <68 they <113 have
obtained <36 purpose.

56:51 For <48 had fallen by the sword, and many of his leaders,
<57 of <21 weariness, which was occasioned by the speed of <9
march—therefore the men of Antipus, <77 confused <20 of the fall
of <15 <29 began to give way <409 the Lamanites.

56:52 And it came to pass that the <135 took <317 and <22 to
<433 them; and thus were the <13 pursuing them with <333 vigor
when Helaman came upon <44 rear with his two thousand, and <27 to
slay them exceedingly, insomuch that the whole army of the <31
<421 and turned upon Helaman.

56:53 Now when the people of <118 saw that the <20 had <18
them about, they gathered together <49 men and came again upon the
rear of the <96

56:54 And now it came to pass that we, the <40 of Nephi, the <4
of <134 and I with my two <82 did surround the Lamanites, and
did slay <112 yea, <85 that they were compelled to <309 up
<58 weapons of war and also themselves as prisoners of war.

56:55 And now it came to pass that when they had surrendered <20
up unto us, <290 I numbered those young men who had fought with me,
fearing lest there were many of them slain.

56:56 But <25 to my <173 joy, <16 had not one soul of them
<256 to the earth; yea, and they had <38 as if with the strength
of God; yea, <444 were men known to have <16 with such miraculous
strength; and with such mighty power did they fall upon the <125
that they did frighten <126 and for this cause did the <189
<127 <99 up as <120 of war.

56:57 And as we had no place for our prisoners, that we could guard
them to keep them from the <412 of the <49 therefore we sent
them to the land of Zarahemla, and a part of <139 men who were not
slain of <207 with <68 and the remainder I took and joined them
to my stripling Ammonites, and took our <430 back to the city of
Judea.

Alma Chapter 57

57:1 And now it came to pass that I received an epistle from Ammoron,
the king, stating that if I <438 <115 up <68 <114 of war
whom we had taken that he <14 <14 up the city of Antiparah unto
us.

57:2 But I sent an <42 unto the <40 that we were sure our forces
were sufficient to take the city of <30 by our force; and by
delivering up the <56 for that city we should suppose ourselves
unwise, and that we <59 only <60 up our <18 on exchange.

57:3 And Ammoron refused mine epistle, for he <19 not exchange
prisoners; <176 we <437 to make preparations to go against the
city of Antiparah.

57:4 But the <384 of <69 did leave the city, and fled to <365
other cities, which they had possession of, to fortify <193 and thus
the city of <26 fell into our hands.

57:5 And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the
judges.

57:6 And it came to pass that in the commencement of the <26 and
ninth year, we <202 a supply of provisions, and also an addition to
our army, from the land of <277 and from the land round about, to
the number of six thousand men, besides sixty of the sons of the
Ammonites who had come to join <109 brethren, my little band of two
thousand. And now <429 we were strong, yea, and we had also plenty
of provisions brought unto us.

57:7 And it came to pass that it was our desire to wage a battle with
the army <154 was placed to protect the city Cumeni.

57:8 And now <52 I will show unto you that we soon accomplished our
desire; yea, with our strong force, or with a part of our <8 <8
we did surround, by night, the city Cumeni, a <96 before they were
to receive a <151 of provisions.

57:9 And it came to pass that we did camp <147 about the city for many
nights; but we did sleep upon our swords, and keep guards, that the
<496 <473 not come upon us by night and slay us, <106 they
attempted many times; but as many times as they <9 this <169
blood was spilt.

57:10 At length <11 <158 did arrive, and they were <63 to
enter the city by night. And we, instead of being Lamanites, were
Nephites; therefore, we did take them and <30 <102

57:11 And notwithstanding the <75 <21 cut off from <14
support after this manner, they were still determined to maintain the
city; <378 it became expedient that we <416 take <480
<68 and send them to Judea, and our <415 to the land of
Zarahemla.

57:12 And it came to pass that not many days had passed away <180 the
<64 <421 to lose all hopes of succor; <52 they yielded up
the city unto our hands; and thus we had <233 our designs in
obtaining the city <257

57:13 But it came to pass that our <68 were so numerous that,
<114 the enormity of our numbers, we were obliged to employ
all our force to keep them, or to put them to death.

57:14 For <297 they <506 break out in great <31 and <7
fight with stones, and with clubs, or whatsoever thing they <236 get
into <161 hands, insomuch that we did slay upwards of two <411 of
them <172 they had surrendered themselves <79 of war.

57:15 Therefore it <172 <172 for us, that we <174 put an end
to <40 lives, or guard <81 sword in hand, down to the land of
Zarahemla; and also our <194 were not any more than sufficient
for our own people, <124 that <302 we had taken from the
Lamanites.

57:16 And now, in <225 critical circumstances, it <63 a very
serious matter to determine concerning these <82 of war;
nevertheless, we did resolve to send them down to the land of
<64 <213 we selected a part of our men, and gave them
charge over our <33 to go down to the land of <264

57:17 But it came to pass that on the morrow they did return. And now
<187 we did not inquire of them <70 the prisoners; for
<12 the <278 were upon us, and they returned in season to save
us from falling into <152 hands. For <21 Ammoron had sent to <8
<361 a new <483 of <149 and also a <268 army of men.

57:18 And it came to pass that <138 men whom we sent with the
<99 did arrive in <53 to check <196 as they were <442 to
overpower us.

57:19 But <59 my little band of two <250 and sixty fought most
desperately; yea, they were firm <376 the <458 and did
administer death unto all <56 who opposed them.

57:20 And as the remainder of our army were <53 to give way <30
the <31 <51 <25 two <48 and <48 were firm and
undaunted.

57:21 Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of
command with exactness; yea, and even according to <141 faith it was
done unto them; and I did remember the words <283 they said unto me
that <21 mothers had taught <82

57:22 And now <68 it was <276 my sons, and <74 men who had been
<265 to convey the prisoners, to whom we owe this <415 victory;
for it was they who did beat the Lamanites; <289 they were driven
back to the city of Manti.

57:23 And we retained our city Cumeni, and were not all destroyed by
the sword; <333 we had suffered <46 loss.

57:24 And it came to pass that <440 the <280 had fled, I
immediately gave orders that my men who had been wounded <437 be
<399 from among the dead, and caused that <120 wounds <13 be
dressed.

57:25 And it came to pass that there were two hundred, out of my two
<199 and sixty, who had fainted because of the loss of blood;
<82 <182 to the goodness of God, and to our <88
astonishment, and also the joy of our whole army, <43 was not one
soul of them who did perish; yea, and neither was <15 one soul <83
them who had not received many wounds.

57:26 And now, <92 preservation was astonishing to our <41 <41
yea, that they <102 be spared while <34 was a <86 of our
brethren who were slain. And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous
power of God, <101 of <42 exceeding <276 in that <266 they had
been <261 to believe—that <39 was a just God, and whosoever did not
doubt, that they <56 be preserved by his marvelous power.

57:27 Now this was the <39 of <283 of whom I have spoken; they are
young, and <54 minds are firm, and they do put <8 trust in God
continually.

57:28 And now it came to pass that <241 we had thus <225 care of our
<234 men, and had buried our dead and also the dead of the
<414 who were many, <349 we did inquire of Gid concerning the
<498 whom they had started to go down to the land of Zarahemla
with.

57:29 Now Gid was the chief captain over the band who was appointed to
guard them down to the land.

57:30 And now, <117 are the <425 <159 Gid said unto me: Behold, we
did start to go down to the land of <54 with our prisoners. And
it came to pass that we did meet the spies of our armies, who had been
sent out to watch the camp of the Lamanites.

57:31 And they cried unto us, saying—Behold, the armies of the
<388 are marching towards the city of Cumeni; and <131 they
will fall upon them, yea, and will destroy our people.

57:32 And it came to pass that our <146 did hear <202 cries,
<103 <404 them to take courage; and they did rise up in rebellion
against us.

57:33 And it came to pass <294 of <30 <16 we did cause that
our swords <277 come upon them. And it came to pass that they did in
a body run upon our swords, in the which, the greater number of them
were slain; and the remainder of them broke through and fled from us.

57:34 And <113 when they had fled and we could not overtake <117 we
took our march with speed <137 the city <136 and <23 we did
arrive in time that we might assist our <404 in preserving the
city.

57:35 And <23 we are again delivered out of the hands of our
enemies. And blessed is the name of our God; for <22 it is he that
has <25 us; yea, that has done this great thing for us.

57:36 Now it came to pass that when I, Helaman, had heard <291 <289
of Gid, I was filled with <459 joy <170 of the goodness of God
in <83 us, that we <92 not all perish; yea, and I <418 that
the souls of them who have been slain have entered into the rest of
<205 God.

Alma Chapter 58

58:1 And <94 now it came to pass that our next object was to obtain
the city of Manti; but <19 there was no way that we <181 lead them
out of the city by our small bands. For <20 they remembered that
<289 we had hitherto done; therefore we <25 not decoy them away from
<71 strongholds.

58:2 And they were so much more numerous than was our army that we
durst not go forth and attack them in <28 <28

58:3 Yea, and it became expedient that we <308 employ our men to the
maintaining those parts of the land <68 we had regained of our
possessions; <71 it <27 <27 that we <27 wait, that we
<169 receive more strength from the land of <470 and also a new
supply of provisions.

58:4 And it came to pass that I thus did send an embassy to the
governor of our land, to acquaint him concerning the affairs of our
<443 And it came to pass that we did wait to <59 provisions and
<61 from the land of Zarahemla.

58:5 But <167 this did profit us but little; for the <499 were
also receiving <300 <26 from day to day, and also many
provisions; and thus were our circumstances at this period of time.

58:6 And the <32 were sallying <169 <482 us from time to
time, resolving by stratagem to destroy us; nevertheless we <215 not
come to battle with <425 <324 of <190 retreats and <3
<194

58:7 And it came to pass that we did wait in <357 difficult
<64 for the space of many months, even until we were about to
perish for the want of food.

58:8 But it came to pass that we did <140 food, <221 was guarded to
us by an army of two thousand men to our assistance; and this is all
the assistance <23 we did receive, to defend ourselves and our
country from falling into the <479 of our enemies, yea, to contend
with an enemy <26 was innumerable.

58:9 And now the cause of <98 our embarrassments, or the <7 why
they did not send more <186 unto us, we knew not; <293 we were
grieved and also <474 with fear, lest by any means the judgments of
God <306 come upon our <266 to our overthrow and utter destruction.

58:10 Therefore we did pour out our <480 in prayer to God, that he
would strengthen us and deliver us out of the <99 of our <99
yea, and also give us <73 that we <352 retain our cities, and our
lands, and our possessions, for the support of our <319

58:11 Yea, and it came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with
assurances that he <62 <59 us; yea, insomuch that he did speak
peace to our souls, and did grant unto us <322 faith, and did <147 us
that we <119 hope for our deliverance in him.

58:12 And we did take courage with our small force <189 we had
received, and were fixed with a determination to conquer our <112
and to maintain our <101 and our <101 and our wives, and our
children, and the <58 of our liberty.

58:13 And thus we did go <367 with all our <138 <371 the
Lamanites, who were in the city of Manti; and we did pitch our tents by
the wilderness side, <73 was near to the city.

58:14 And it came to pass that on the morrow, that when the <419
saw that we were in the borders by the <35 <34 was near the
city, that they sent out <409 spies round <381 us that they <74
discover the number and the <222 of our army.

58:15 And it came to pass that when they saw that we were not strong,
according to our numbers, and fearing that we <182 cut them off from
<51 <244 except they <10 come out to <476 <126 us and kill
us, and also supposing that they <493 easily <499 us with <25
numerous hosts, <355 they began to make preparations to come out
<30 us to battle.

58:16 And when we saw that they were making <21 to come out
<21 us, behold, I caused that Gid, with a <239 <110 of men,
<70 secrete himself in the wilderness, and also that Teomner and a
<18 <18 of men <17 <17 themselves also in the wilderness.

58:17 Now Gid and his men were on the right and the others on the left;
and when they had thus secreted themselves, <63 I remained, with
the remainder of my army, in that same place where we had first pitched
our <247 <87 the time that the <225 <62 come out to
<116

58:18 And it came to pass that the <18 did come out with <150
<150 army <32 us. And when they had come and were <236 to fall
upon us with the sword, I <134 that my men, those who were with me,
<55 retreat into the <115

58:19 And it came to pass that the <54 did follow after us with
<428 speed, for they were exceedingly desirous to overtake us that
they <288 slay us; <218 they did <24 us into the wilderness;
and we did pass by in the midst of Gid and Teomner, <480 that they
were not discovered by the Lamanites.

58:20 And it came to pass that when the <66 had passed by, or
when the army had <8 by, Gid and <221 did rise up from <134
secret places, and did cut off the <368 of the <31 that they
<117 not return to the <420

58:21 And it came to pass that when they had cut them off, they ran to
the city and fell upon the guards who were left to guard the <420
<98 that they did <348 them and did take possession of the
<49 Alma 58:22 Now this was done because the <67 did suffer
<83 whole <260 save a few <41 only, to be led away into the
<195

58:23 And it came to pass that Gid and <116 by this means had
obtained <52 of <37 strongholds. And it came to pass that we
took our course, <215 having traveled much in the <510 towards
the land of Zarahemla.

58:24 And when the <74 saw that they were marching <19 the
land of Zarahemla, they were <240 afraid, lest there was a plan
laid to lead them on to destruction; <244 they <462 to <286
into the <51 again, yea, even back by the same way which they
had come.

58:25 And <393 it was night and they did pitch <97 tents, for the
chief captains of the <73 had supposed that the Nephites were
weary <158 of <20 march; and supposing that they had driven <8
<163 army <67 they took no thought concerning the city of Manti.

58:26 Now it came to pass that when it was night, I <385 that my men
<263 not sleep, but that they <6 march forward by another way
<133 the land of <38

58:27 And <67 of this our <20 in the night-time, <101 on the
morrow we were beyond the Lamanites, <263 that we did arrive before
them at the city of <36

58:28 And thus it came to pass, that by this stratagem we did take
<233 of the city of Manti without the shedding of blood.

58:29 And it came to pass that when the armies of the <151 did
<56 near the <328 and saw that we were prepared to meet them, they
were astonished <230 and struck with <479 fear, <83 that
they did flee into the <313

58:30 Yea, and it came to pass that the <50 of the <50 did
flee out of all this quarter of the land. But <130 they have carried
with them many women and children out of the <16

58:31 And those cities <263 had been taken by the <149 all of
them are at this period of time in our possession; and our fathers and
our <40 and our <41 are returning to <250 homes, all save it be
<42 who have been <41 prisoners and <66 off by the Lamanites.

58:32 But <79 our <97 are small to maintain so <126 a number of
<71 and so <8 possessions.

58:33 But <23 we trust in our God who has given us victory over
<53 lands, <154 that we have <444 <7 <31 and <3
<11 <106 were our own.

58:34 Now we do not know the cause that the government does not grant
us more strength; neither do <30 men who came up unto us know why we
have not received greater strength.

58:35 Behold, we do not know but what ye are unsuccessful, and ye have
drawn away the forces into that <200 of the land; if so, we do not
desire to murmur.

58:36 And if it is not so, <116 we fear that <492 is some faction
in the government, that they do not send more men to our assistance;
for we know that they are more numerous than that <123 they have sent.

58:37 But, <42 it mattereth not—we <160 God will deliver us,
notwithstanding the weakness of our armies, yea, and <11 us out of
the hands of our enemies.

58:38 <117 this is the twenty and ninth year, in the latter end, and
we are in the <399 of our lands; and the <329 have fled to
the land of Nephi.

58:39 And <175 sons of the people of Ammon, of whom I have so highly
spoken, are with me in the city of Manti; and the Lord had supported
<407 yea, and kept them from falling by the sword, <252 that even
one soul has not been slain.

58:40 But <124 they have <219 many wounds; nevertheless they
stand fast in that liberty wherewith God has made them free; and they
are strict to remember the Lord <358 God from day to day; yea, they do
observe to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments
continually; and <24 faith is strong in the prophecies concerning
that <196 is to come.

58:41 And now, my beloved brother, Moroni, may the Lord our God, who
has redeemed us and made us free, keep you continually in his presence;
yea, and may he favor this people, even that ye may have success in
obtaining the <189 of all that <56 the <189 have <441
from us, <8 was for our support. And now, <134 I close mine
epistle. I am Helaman, the son of Alma.

Alma Chapter 59

59:1 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year of the reign of the
judges over the <225 of Nephi, after Moroni had <178 and had read
Helaman’s epistle, he was exceedingly rejoiced because of the welfare,
yea, the exceeding <90 <74 Helaman had had, in <93 <261
lands <9 were lost.

59:2 Yea, and he did make it known unto all his <123 in all the land
round about in that part where he was, that they might rejoice also.

59:3 And it came to pass that he immediately sent an epistle to
Pahoran, desiring that he should <510 men to be gathered together to
strengthen <135 or the armies of <5 <298 that he <43
with ease maintain that part of the land <86 he had been so
miraculously prospered in regaining.

59:4 And it came to pass when <137 had sent this <60 to the land
of Zarahemla, he began again to lay a plan that he <50 obtain the
remainder of <135 possessions and cities <50 the <227 had <227
from them.

59:5 And it came to pass that while <49 was thus making preparations
to go against the <27 to battle, <244 the <205 of Nephihah,
who were <114 <114 from the city of <27 and the city of Lehi
and the city of Morianton, were attacked by the Lamanites.

59:6 Yea, even <73 who had been compelled to flee from the land of
Manti, and from the land <199 about, had come over and joined the
<66 in this part of the land.

59:7 And thus being <265 numerous, yea, and receiving strength
from day to day, by the command of Ammoron they came forth <101 the
<97 of <97 and they did begin to slay them with an <34
great slaughter.

59:8 And <445 <219 were so numerous that the <165 of the <31
of Nephihah were obliged to flee before them; and they came even and
<86 the army of Moroni.

59:9 And now as <144 had supposed that there <274 be men sent to
the city <70 to the assistance of the <47 to <267 that
city, and knowing that it was easier to keep the city from falling into
the hands of the <138 than to retake it from them, he <49
that they would easily <36 that city.

59:10 Therefore he retained all his force to <14 <193 places
<265 he had recovered.

59:11 And now, when <86 saw that the city of <117 was lost he
was <145 sorrowful, and <309 to doubt, <448 of the
wickedness of the <420 whether they <109 not fall into the <79
of <160 brethren.

59:12 Now this was the case with all his chief captains. They doubted
and marveled also <40 of the <39 of the <39 and this
<10 of the <493 of the <117 over <345

59:13 And it came to pass that <87 was angry with the government,
<26 of <60 indifference concerning the freedom of <6 country.

Alma Chapter 60

60:1 And it came to pass that he wrote <415 to the governor of the
land, who was <491 and these are the words <149 he wrote, saying:
Behold, I direct mine <449 to <17 in the city of <450 who
is the <109 judge and the <38 over the <37 and also to all
<186 who have been chosen by this <246 to govern and manage the
affairs of this war.

60:2 For <439 I have somewhat to say unto them by the way of
condemnation; for <15 ye yourselves know that ye have been
appointed to gather <457 men, and arm them with swords, and with
cimeters, and all manner of weapons of war of every kind, and send
<395 <395 the Lamanites, in whatsoever parts they <226 come into
our <434

60:3 And now <56 I say unto you that myself, and also my men, and
also Helaman and his men, have suffered <274 <418 sufferings;
yea, even hunger, thirst, and fatigue, and all <63 of afflictions of
<62 kind.

60:4 But <44 were this all we had <31 we <349 not murmur nor
complain.

60:5 But <19 <43 has been the slaughter among our people; yea,
thousands have fallen by the sword, while it might have otherwise been
if ye had rendered unto our <482 sufficient strength and succor for
<290 Yea, <38 has been your neglect towards us.

60:6 And now <52 we desire to know the cause of this <104
<24 neglect; yea, we <13 to know the <13 of your thoughtless
state.

60:7 Can you think to sit upon your thrones in a state of <19
stupor, <79 your enemies are spreading the work of death around you?
Yea, <13 they are murdering <102 of your brethren—

60:8 Yea, even they who have looked up to you for protection, yea, have
placed you in a situation that ye <123 have succored <511 yea, ye
<7 have sent <122 unto <9 to have strengthened <4 and have
saved <50 of them from falling by the sword.

60:9 But <124 this is not all—ye have withheld your provisions from
<29 insomuch that many have fought and bled out <423 lives <433
of <5 <139 desires <395 they had for the welfare of this <204
yea, and this they have done when they were about to perish with
<265 <31 of your <171 <31 <191 <191 <199

60:10 And now, my beloved brethren—for ye ought to be beloved; yea, and
ye <8 to have stirred <376 more diligently for the <55 and
the <497 of this <59 but <97 ye have neglected them <90
that the blood of <121 shall come upon your heads for vengeance;
yea, for known unto God were all <99 cries, and all <4 sufferings—

60:11 <496 could ye suppose that ye <5 sit upon your thrones, and
<94 of the exceeding goodness of God ye <15 do nothing and he
<348 deliver you? <30 if ye have supposed this ye have <4 in
vain.

60:12 Do ye <45 that, <37 so many of your brethren have been
killed it is <12 of <70 wickedness? I say unto you, if ye have
<36 this ye have <4 in vain; for I say unto you, there are
many who have <389 by the sword; and behold it is to your
condemnation;

60:13 For the Lord suffereth the righteous to be slain that his justice
and judgment may come upon the wicked; therefore ye need not <84
that the <23 are lost <77 they are slain; but <181 they do
enter into the rest of the Lord <91 God.

60:14 And now <19 I say unto you, I fear <248 that the
judgments of God will come upon this people, <43 of <29 <169
slothfulness, yea, even the slothfulness of our government, and <12
<28 <276 <276 <276 <6 brethren, yea, <4 those
who have been slain.

60:15 For were it not for the wickedness <329 first commenced at our
head, we <210 have withstood our <447 that they <7 have gained
no power over us.

60:16 Yea, had it not been for the war <35 broke out among ourselves;
yea, were it not for these king-men, who caused so much bloodshed <15
<16 yea, at the time we were contending <10 ourselves, if we
had united our strength as we hitherto have done; yea, had it not been
for the desire of <67 and authority <55 <108 king-men had over us;
had they been true to the cause of our freedom, and <39 with us, and
gone forth against our enemies, instead of taking up <143 swords
<10 us, <37 was the <27 of so much <82 <72 <81
yea, if we had gone <29 <19 them in the <77 of the Lord, we
should have dispersed our <41 for it <357 have been done,
according to the fulfilling of his word.

60:17 But <238 now the Lamanites are coming upon us, <66
possession of our lands, and they are murdering our people with the
sword, yea, our women and our children, and also carrying them away
captive, causing them that they <65 suffer all manner of
afflictions, and this <269 of the <255 <233 of <143 who are
seeking for <153 and authority, yea, even <11 king-men.

60:18 But why <34 I say much concerning this matter? For we know not
but what ye yourselves are <32 for authority. We know not but what
ye are also traitors to your country.

60:19 Or is it that ye have neglected us <70 ye are in the heart of
our country and ye are surrounded by security, that ye do not <188
food to be sent unto us, and also men to strengthen our armies?

60:20 Have ye forgotten the commandments of the Lord your God? Yea,
have ye <12 the captivity of our fathers? Have ye <8 the
many times we have been delivered out of the hands of our enemies?

60:21 Or do ye <473 that the Lord will still deliver us, while we
sit upon our thrones and do not make use of the means <278 the Lord
has provided for us?

60:22 Yea, will ye sit in idleness <33 ye are <115 with
thousands of those, yea, and tens of thousands, who do also sit in
idleness, <21 there are <18 round about in the borders of the
land who are falling by the <261 yea, wounded and bleeding?

60:23 Do ye <91 that God will look upon you as guiltless <38 ye
sit <99 and behold <443 things? Behold I say unto you, Nay. Now I
<339 that ye <250 remember that God has said that the inward vessel
shall be cleansed first, and then <6 the outer <11 be <9
also.

60:24 And now, except ye do repent of that <135 ye have <379 and
begin to be up and doing, and send <411 food and men unto us, and also
unto Helaman, that he may support <324 parts of our <266 <34 he
has regained, and that we may also recover the remainder of our
possessions in <103 parts, <106 it will be expedient that we contend
no more with the <426 until we have first <87 our <103
vessel, yea, even the <389 head of our government.

60:25 And <96 ye grant mine epistle, and come out and show unto me a
true spirit of freedom, and strive to <321 and fortify our
armies, and <26 unto them food for their support, <71 I will leave
a part of my freemen to maintain this part of our land, and I will
<18 the strength and the blessings of God upon them, that none other
<460 can operate against them—

60:26 And this <413 of <50 exceeding faith, and <4 patience in
<4 tribulations—

60:27 And I will come unto you, and if <290 be any among you that has
a desire for <99 yea, if <14 be even a spark of freedom
remaining, <93 I will stir up insurrections <26 you, even <159
<200 who have desires to usurp <75 and authority <258 become
extinct.

60:28 Yea, <29 I do not fear your <18 nor your authority, but it
is my God whom I fear; and it is according to his <471 that I
do take my sword to defend the <505 of my country, and it is <119
of your iniquity that we have suffered so much loss.

60:29 <355 it is time, yea, the time is now at hand, that <228 ye
do bestir yourselves in the defence of your <296 and your little
ones, the <57 of justice doth hang over you; yea, and it <108 fall
upon you and visit you even to your utter destruction.

60:30 Behold, I wait for assistance from you; and, <53 ye do
administer unto our relief, behold, I come unto you, even in the land
of Zarahemla, and smite you with the <474 insomuch that ye can have
no more <152 to impede the progress of this people in the <132 of our
freedom.

60:31 For <46 the Lord will not suffer that ye <87 live and wax
strong in your iniquities to destroy his righteous people.

60:32 <88 can you suppose that the Lord will spare you and come out
in judgment <304 the Lamanites, when it is the tradition of <295
fathers that has caused <6 hatred, yea, and it has been redoubled by
<263 who have dissented from us, while your <206 is for the <89
of your love of glory and the vain things of the world?

60:33 Ye know that ye do transgress the laws of God, and ye do know
that ye do trample them under your feet. <94 the Lord saith unto
me: If <61 whom ye have appointed your governors do not repent of
<83 sins and iniquities, ye <137 go up to battle <108 them.

60:34 And now <158 I, Moroni, am constrained, <319 to the
covenant which I have made to keep the <328 of my God;
therefore I would that ye should adhere to the word of God, and send
speedily unto me of your provisions and of your men, and also to
Helaman.

60:35 And <57 if ye will not do this I come unto you speedily; for
<14 God will not <228 that we <51 perish with hunger;
<61 he will give unto us of your food, even if it must be by the
sword. Now see that ye fulfil the word of God.

60:36 <152 I am <115 your chief captain. I seek not for power,
but to pull it down. I seek not for honor of the world, but for the
<217 of my God, and the freedom and welfare of my country. And thus I
close mine epistle.

Alma Chapter 61

61:1 <59 now it came to pass that soon after Moroni had sent his
epistle unto the <71 governor, he received an <8 from Pahoran,
the <10 governor. And these are the words <197 he received:

61:2 I, <18 who am the <19 governor of this land, do send <23
<22 unto <113 the <13 captain over the army. <64 I say unto
you, <13 that I do not joy in your great afflictions, yea, it
grieves my soul.

61:3 But <193 there are <297 who do joy in your <21 yea,
<462 that they have risen up in rebellion <292 me, and also
<22 of my <463 who are freemen, yea, and <9 who have <21 up
are exceedingly numerous.

61:4 And it is <16 who have sought to take away the judgment-seat
from me that have been the <409 of this <82 iniquity; for they have
used <7 flattery, and they have led away the hearts of many people,
<146 will be the <27 of sore affliction among us; they have withheld
our provisions, and have daunted our freemen that they have not come
unto you.

61:5 And <123 they have driven me out before them, and I have fled
to the land of Gideon, with as many men as it were possible that I
could get.

61:6 And <36 I have sent a proclamation throughout this part of the
land; and <14 they are flocking to us daily, to <463 arms, in the
defence of <7 country and <3 freedom, and to avenge our wrongs.

61:7 And they have come unto us, <196 that <160 who have <176 up
in <198 <198 us are set at defiance, yea, <17 that they do
fear us and durst not come out <19 us to battle.

61:8 They have got possession of the <292 or the city, of Zarahemla;
they have appointed a king over <134 and he hath written unto the king
of the Lamanites, in the <189 he hath joined an alliance with him; in
the <11 <7 he hath agreed to maintain the city of Zarahemla,
<12 maintenance he supposeth will enable the Lamanites to conquer the
remainder of the <65 and he shall be placed king over this <297
when they <10 be conquered under the Lamanites.

61:9 And now, in your <412 you have censured me, but it mattereth
not; I am not angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart. I,
<417 do not seek for <512 save only to retain my <321
that I may preserve the rights and the liberty of my people. My soul
standeth fast in that <11 in the <102 God hath made us free.

61:10 And now, <242 we will resist wickedness even unto bloodshed.
We would not shed the blood of the <124 if they <10 stay in
<248 own land.

61:11 We <12 not shed the <22 of our brethren if they <10 not
rise up in <246 and take the sword <231 us.

61:12 We <18 subject ourselves to the yoke of bondage if it were
requisite with the justice of God, or if he should command us so to do.

61:13 But behold he doth not <14 us that we <186 <40 <40
to our enemies, but that we <29 put our trust in him, and he will
deliver us.

61:14 Therefore, my beloved brother, Moroni, let us <130 evil, and
whatsoever evil we cannot <8 with our words, yea, such as
rebellions and dissensions, let us <13 them with our swords, that we
may <201 our <388 that we may <225 in the <511 privilege of
our church, and in the <503 of our Redeemer and our God.

61:15 <66 come unto me speedily with a few of your men, and
leave the <309 in the charge of Lehi and Teancum; give unto them
power to conduct the war in that part of the <328 according to the
Spirit of God, <249 is also the <7 of freedom <7 is in them.

61:16 Behold I have sent a few provisions unto <411 that they may not
perish until ye can come unto me.

61:17 Gather together <142 force ye can upon your march hither,
and we will go <96 <240 <499 dissenters, in the strength of
our God <73 to the faith <63 is in us.

61:18 And we will take <486 of the city of <440 that we may
obtain more food to send forth unto Lehi and <124 yea, we will go
<10 <52 them in the <51 of the Lord, and we will put an end
to this <190 iniquity.

61:19 And now, <240 I do joy in receiving your epistle, for I was
somewhat worried concerning what we <277 do, whether it <4 be
just in us to go <54 our brethren.

61:20 But ye have said, except they repent the Lord hath commanded you
that ye <30 go <24 <177

61:21 See that ye strengthen Lehi and Teancum in the Lord; tell them to
fear not, for God will <328 <189 yea, and also all <160 who stand
fast in that <476 wherewith God hath made them <474 And now I close
mine epistle to my <349 <349 Moroni.

Alma Chapter 62

62:1 And now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this <28
his heart did take courage, and was filled with exceedingly <152 joy
because of the faithfulness of Pahoran, that he was not also a traitor
to the <290 and <354 of his country.

62:2 But he did also mourn <35 <32 of the iniquity of <100
who had driven Pahoran from the judgment-seat, yea, in fine <17 of
<15 who had rebelled <150 their country and also <4 God.

62:3 And it came to pass that <92 took a small number of men,
<295 to the desire of <81 and gave Lehi and <173 command
over the <406 of his army, and took his <335 towards the land of
Gideon.

62:4 And he did raise the standard of <177 in <361 place he
did enter, and gained <8 <369 he could in all his <35
<36 the land of <35

62:5 And it came to pass that thousands did flock unto his standard,
and did take up <105 swords in the defence of <6 freedom, that they
might not come into bondage.

62:6 And thus, when <116 had gathered <431 <62 men he
<63 in all his march, he came to the land of Gideon; and uniting his
forces with <163 of <175 they became <189 strong, even
stronger than the men of Pachus, who was the king of <20 dissenters
who had <199 the freemen out of the land of Zarahemla and had taken
<451 of the land.

62:7 And it came to pass that <78 and <52 went down with <101
armies into the land of <473 and went <456 <228 the city, and
did meet the men of <65 insomuch that they did come to battle.

62:8 And behold, Pachus was slain and his men were <64 prisoners, and
<50 was restored to his judgment-seat.

62:9 And the men of <25 <351 <62 trial, <256 to the law,
and also <109 king-men who had been <34 and cast into prison; and
they were executed <22 to the law; yea, <20 men of <34 and
<6 king-men, whosoever would not take up arms in the <210 of
<48 country, but <13 fight <104 it, were put to death.

62:10 And thus it <182 expedient that this law <502 be strictly
observed for the safety of <32 country; yea, and <47 was found
denying <9 <409 was speedily <70 <70 to the law.

62:11 And thus ended the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi; <188 and <138 having <138 peace to the
land of <186 among <44 own people, <13 inflicted death upon
all <107 who were not true to the <466 of freedom.

62:12 And it came to pass in the commencement of the thirty and first
year of the <63 of the <63 over the <62 of Nephi, <62
immediately caused that provisions <117 be sent, and also an army of
six thousand men <12 be sent unto Helaman, to assist him in
preserving that part of the <294

62:13 And he also <38 that an army of six <31 men, with a
sufficient quantity of food, <38 be sent to the <303 of Lehi and
Teancum. And it came to pass that this was done to fortify the land
<210 the Lamanites.

62:14 And it came to pass that <94 and Pahoran, leaving a large body
of men in the land of <159 took <159 <490 with a <15 body of
men <496 the land of Nephihah, being determined to overthrow the
Lamanites in that city.

62:15 And it came to pass that as they were marching <29 the land,
they took a <41 body of men of the Lamanites, and slew many of them,
and took <60 <166 and <3 weapons of war.

62:16 And it came to pass after they had <357 <24 they <151 them
to enter into a covenant that they <333 no more take up <34 <34
of war <131 the Nephites.

62:17 And when they had entered into this <27 they sent them to
dwell with the <238 of Ammon, and they were in number about four
<199 who had not been slain.

62:18 And it came to pass that when they had sent them away they
pursued <64 <161 <125 the land of Nephihah. And it came to pass
that when they had come to the city of <170 they did pitch <26
tents in the plains of <11 which is near the city of <34

62:19 Now <223 was desirous that the <192 <267 come out to
battle <117 <140 upon the plains; but the <175 knowing of
<43 exceedingly great courage, and beholding the greatness of <9
numbers, therefore they durst not come out <29 them; <8 they
did not come to <39 in that day.

62:20 And when the night came, <63 went forth in the darkness of the
night, and came upon the top of the wall to spy out in what part of the
city the <87 did camp with <64 army.

62:21 And it came to pass that they were on the east, by the entrance;
and they were all asleep. And now <61 returned to his army, and
<256 that they <128 prepare in haste strong cords and ladders, to
be let down from the top of the wall into the inner part of the wall.

62:22 And it came to pass that <46 <40 that his men <41 <221
<113 and come upon the top of the wall, and let themselves down into
that part of the city, yea, even on the west, where the <113 did
not camp with <115 armies.

62:23 And it came to pass that they were all let down into the city by
<161 by the means of <27 <101 <101 and <4 ladders; thus when
the morning came they were all within the walls of the <442

62:24 And now, when the <62 awoke and saw that the armies of
<106 were <25 the walls, they were affrighted exceedingly,
insomuch that they did flee out by the pass.

62:25 And now when <26 saw that they were fleeing before him, he did
cause that his men <142 <142 <141 <279 <308 and slew many, and
surrounded many others, and took them prisoners; and the remainder of
them fled into the land of Moroni, <358 was in the borders by the
seashore.

62:26 Thus had <59 and Pahoran obtained the possession of the city
of Nephihah without the loss of one soul; and there were many of the
<119 who were <455

62:27 Now it came to pass that many of the <17 that were
prisoners were <407 to join the <495 of Ammon and become a free
people.

62:28 And it came to pass that as many as were desirous, unto them it
was granted according to <203 desires.

62:29 Therefore, all the <47 of the <54 did join the <48
of Ammon, and did begin to labor <186 tilling the ground,
raising all manner of grain, and flocks and herds of every kind; and
thus were the Nephites relieved from a <471 burden; yea, <213 that
they were <11 from all the <54 of the Lamanites.

62:30 Now it came to pass that <177 after he had <162 <161
of the city of Nephihah, having taken many prisoners, <192 did reduce
the <270 of the <89 <77 and <15 regained many of
the <63 who had been <24 <23 <23 did strengthen the
army of <207 exceedingly; therefore <3 went <254 from the land
of <207 to the land of Lehi.

62:31 And it came to pass that when the <51 saw that <29 was
coming <284 <284 they were again frightened and fled <304 the
army of Moroni.

62:32 And it came to pass that <28 and his army did pursue them from
city to <442 until they were met by Lehi and Teancum; and the
<54 fled from Lehi and Teancum, even down upon the <311 by the
seashore, <26 they came to the land of <56

62:33 And the <137 of the <32 were all gathered together,
<190 that they were all in one body in the land of <28 Now,
Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites, was also with them.

62:34 And it came to pass that <96 and Lehi and Teancum did encamp
with <288 <54 round about in the <78 of the land of <222
<57 that the <66 were encircled <16 in the <16 by the
wilderness on the south, and in the <11 by the <10 on the
east.

62:35 And thus they did <52 for the night. For behold, the <234
and the <44 also were weary because of the greatness of the
march; <235 they did not resolve upon any stratagem in the
night-time, save it were <173 for he was exceedingly angry with
<124 <83 that he considered that <6 and Amalickiah his
brother, had been the cause of this <350 and lasting war between them
and the <146 <295 had been the <17 of so much war and
bloodshed, yea, and so much famine.

62:36 And it came to pass that <155 in his anger did go <316 into
the camp of the <41 and did let himself down over the walls of
the city. And he went <23 with a cord, from place to place, <91
that he did find the king; and he did cast a javelin at him, <80 did
pierce him near the heart. But <158 the king did awaken his servants
<341 he died, <36 that they did <327 <305 and slew him.

62:37 Now it came to pass that when Lehi and <254 knew that <98
was dead they were <163 sorrowful; for <45 he had been a man
who had fought valiantly for his country, yea, a true friend to
liberty; and he had suffered very many <30 sore afflictions.
But <32 he was dead, and had gone the way of all the earth.

62:38 Now it came to pass that <67 marched <135 on the morrow, and
came upon the <160 <101 that they did slay them with a <219
slaughter; and they did drive them out of the land; and they did flee,
even that they did not return at that time <487 the Nephites.

62:39 And thus ended the thirty and first year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi; and thus they had had wars, and
bloodsheds, and famine, and affliction, for the space of many years.

62:40 And there had been murders, and contentions, and dissensions, and
all manner of iniquity among the <43 of <43 nevertheless for the
righteous’ sake, yea, <371 of the prayers of the righteous, they
were spared.

62:41 But <162 <17 of the <171 <124 length of the war
<345 the <408 and the <407 many had become hardened,
<21 of the <21 <21 <21 of the war; and many were
softened <14 of <489 afflictions, <167 that they did humble
themselves <278 God, even in the depth of humility.

62:42 And it came to pass that after <205 had fortified those parts
of the land <323 were most exposed to the <209 until they were
sufficiently strong, he returned to the city of Zarahemla; and also
Helaman <10 to the <369 of his inheritance; and <149 was once
more peace established <142 the <142 of Nephi.

62:43 And <58 yielded up the command of his armies into the hands of
his son, whose name was Moronihah; and he retired to his own house that
he might spend the remainder of his days in peace.

62:44 And Pahoran did <266 to his judgment-seat; and <76 did take
upon him again to preach unto the <69 the word of God; for <155
of so many wars and contentions it had <182 expedient that a
regulation should be made <30 in the church.

62:45 Therefore, <45 and his brethren went forth, and did declare
the word of God with much power unto the convincing of many <56 of
<206 wickedness, <171 did cause them to repent of <9 sins and to
be baptized unto the Lord <10 God.

62:46 And it came to pass that they did establish <68 the church of
God, throughout all the land.

62:47 Yea, and regulations were made concerning the law. And <38
judges, and <4 chief <379 were chosen.

62:48 And the <75 of Nephi began to prosper <44 in the land, and
<9 to multiply and to wax <309 strong <14 in the <52 And
they <15 to grow <12 rich.

62:49 But notwithstanding <49 riches, or <3 strength, or <3
prosperity, they were not lifted up in the pride of <12 eyes; neither
were they slow to remember the Lord <11 God; but they did <344
<344 <45 <345 him.

62:50 Yea, they did <21 how <377 things the Lord had done for
them, that he had delivered them from death, and from bonds, and from
prisons, and from all <460 of afflictions and he had <20 them
out of the <307 of <60 enemies.

62:51 And they did pray unto the Lord <13 God continually, <419
that the Lord did bless <55 according to his word, so that they did
wax <142 and <158 in the <143

62:52 And it came to pass that all these <91 were done. And <280
died, in the thirty and fifth year of the reign of the <206 over the
<201 of <401

Alma Chapter 63

63:1 And it came to pass in the commencement of the <36 and sixth
year of the <37 of the <37 over the <36 of Nephi, that Shiblon
took possession of <493 sacred <69 <319 had been <133 unto
<72 by Alma.

63:2 And he was a just man, and he did walk uprightly <197 God; and
he did observe to do good <141 to keep the commandments of the
Lord his God; and also did his brother.

63:3 And it came to pass that <501 died also. And thus ended the
<93 and <93 year of the <92 of the judges.

63:4 And it came to pass that in the <22 and seventh year of the
<23 of the <362 there was a large company of men, even to the
amount of five thousand and four hundred men, with <230 wives and
<4 children, departed out of the land of Zarahemla into the land
<138 was northward.

63:5 And it came to pass that Hagoth, he being an <329 curious
man, therefore he went forth and built him an <12 <64 ship,
on the borders of the land Bountiful, by the land Desolation, and
launched it <24 into the west sea, by the narrow neck <57 led into
the land <61

63:6 And behold, <107 were many of the Nephites who did enter therein
and did sail <36 with much provisions, and also many women and
children; and they took <111 course <37 And thus <176 the
<154 and <154 year.

63:7 And in the <11 and eighth year, this man <97 other ships. And
the first ship did also return, and many more <287 did <61 into it;
and they also took much <61 and set out again to the land
<57

63:8 And it came to pass that they were never heard of more. And we
suppose that they were drowned in the depths of the sea. And it came to
pass that one <72 ship also did sail forth; and whither she did go we
know not.

63:9 And it came to pass that in this year <154 were many <90 who
went <147 into the land <78 And thus <135 the <123 and
<124 <135

63:10 And it came to pass in the <16 and ninth year of the <303 of
the <304 <413 died also, and Corianton had gone <43 to the land
northward in a <251 to carry <11 provisions unto the <62 who had
gone <9 into that land.

63:11 Therefore it became expedient for <40 to confer <451 <451
things, <428 his death, upon the son of Helaman, who was called
<5 <312 <4 after the name of his father.

63:12 Now <271 all <32 engravings <287 were in the <491 of
<483 were written and sent <62 among the children of men
throughout all the land, save it were <28 parts <28 had been
commanded by Alma should not go forth.

63:13 Nevertheless, these things were to be kept sacred, and handed
down from one generation to another; therefore, in this <287 they had
been conferred upon <88 <101 the death of Shiblon.

63:14 And it came to pass also in this year that <210 were some
dissenters who had gone <86 unto the Lamanites; and they were stirred
up <300 to anger against the Nephites.

63:15 And also in this same year they came down with a numerous army to
war <23 the <191 of Moronihah, or <6 the army of <6
in the <120 they were beaten and driven back <47 to <403 own lands,
suffering great loss.

63:16 And thus <276 the <260 and <260 year of the <260 of the
judges over the <49 of Nephi.

63:17 And thus <24 the account of Alma, and <193 his son, and also
Shiblon, who was his son.




 THE BOOK OF HELAMAN


An <35 of the <121 Their wars and contentions, and <83
dissensions. And also the prophecies of many holy prophets, <180 the
coming of Christ, according to the records of <192 who was the son
of <7 and also <15 to the <15 of his sons, even down to
the <30 of Christ. And also many of the Lamanites are converted. An
<66 of <59 conversion. An <5 of the righteousness of the
Lamanites, and the wickedness and abominations of the Nephites,
<47 to the record of <124 and his <49 even down to the
<49 of <79 <188 is <354 the book of Helaman.

<22 Chapter 1

1:1 And now <359 it came to pass in the commencement of the fortieth
year of the <192 of the <191 over the <191 of Nephi, <289 began
to be a serious difficulty <374 the <13 of the <158

1:2 For <43 Pahoran had died, and gone the way of all the earth;
therefore <33 <33 to be a <32 contention concerning who <386
have the judgment-seat <39 the brethren, who were the sons of
Pahoran.

1:3 Now <397 are <144 names who did contend for the judgment-seat,
who did also cause the <68 to contend: Pahoran, Paanchi, and
Pacumeni.

1:4 Now <29 are not all the sons of <17 (for he had many) but
<14 are they who did <42 for the judgment-seat; <433 they
did <42 three divisions <74 the people.

1:5 <464 it came to pass that <114 was appointed by the
voice of the <65 to be chief judge and a governor over the <10 of
<348

1:6 And it came to pass that Pacumeni, when he saw that he could not
obtain the <107 he did unite with the <44 of the <64

1:7 But <174 <112 and that part of the <47 that were desirous
that he <165 be <145 governor, was exceedingly wroth; <100 he
was about to flatter away those <23 to rise up in rebellion <468
<22 brethren.

1:8 And it came to pass as he was <27 to do this, <56 he was
taken, and was tried <317 to the <76 of the people, and
condemned unto death; for he had raised up in <47 and sought to
destroy the liberty of the <98

1:9 Now when <70 <70 who were <93 that he <92 be <70
<153 saw that he was <42 unto death, <279 they were
angry, and <68 they sent forth one Kishkumen, even to the
<281 of <231 and murdered <198 as he sat upon the
judgment-seat.

1:10 And he was pursued by the servants of Pahoran; but <37 so
speedy was the flight of Kishkumen that no man <193 overtake him.

1:11 And he went unto <85 that sent him, and they all entered into a
covenant, yea, swearing by <91 everlasting Maker, that they would
tell no man that <41 had <74 <350

1:12 Therefore, <9 was not known <295 the <125 of <421 for
he was in disguise at the time that he <27 <27 And <23
and his band, who had covenanted with him, did mingle themselves <32
the <188 in a manner that they all <92 not be found; but as many
as were found were <162 unto death.

1:13 And now <125 Pacumeni was appointed, <226 to the <226 of
the <39 to be a <348 <348 and a <195 over the <11 to
reign in the stead of his brother <159 and it was <32 to his
right. And all this was done in the fortieth year of the <27 of the
judges; and it had an end.

1:14 And it came to pass in the forty and first year of the <27 of
the judges, that the Lamanites had gathered together an innumerable
army of men, and armed them with swords, and with cimeters and with
bows, and with arrows, and with head-plates, and with breastplates, and
with all <146 of shields of every kind.

1:15 And they came down again that they might pitch battle <391 the
Nephites. And they were led by a man whose name was Coriantumr; and he
was a descendant of Zarahemla; and he was a dissenter from <201 the
Nephites; and he was a large and a mighty man.

1:16 <255 the king of the Lamanites, <41 name was Tubaloth, who
was the son of Ammoron, supposing that Coriantumr, being a <28 man,
<233 stand <73 the Nephites, with his strength and also with his
great wisdom, insomuch that by sending him <391 he <414 gain power
over the Nephites—

1:17 Therefore he did stir them up to anger, and he did gather <168
his armies, and he did appoint Coriantumr to be <355 leader, and did
cause that they <42 march down to the land of Zarahemla to <145
<73 the <145

1:18 And it came to pass that because of so much contention and so much
difficulty in the government, that they had not kept sufficient guards
in the land of <162 for they had supposed that the <246
durst not come into the heart of <73 lands to attack that <121 city
Zarahemla.

1:19 But it came to pass that <95 did <85 <131 at the head of
his numerous host, and came upon the inhabitants of the city, and <40
<21 was with such exceedingly <42 speed that there was no time for
the Nephites to <144 <144 <21 armies.

1:20 <163 <49 did cut down the watch by the entrance of the
<42 and did <41 <62 with his whole army into the <11 and they
did slay <313 one who did oppose them, <217 that they did take
possession of the <25 city.

1:21 And it came to pass that Pacumeni, who was the <454 judge, did
flee before <269 even to the walls of the <28 And it came to
pass that <81 did smite him <207 the wall, <53 that he
died. And thus ended the days of Pacumeni.

1:22 And now when <26 saw that he was in <72 of the city
of Zarahemla, and saw that the <135 had fled <62 <94 and were
slain, and were taken, and were cast into prison, and that he had
obtained the <35 of the strongest hold in all the land, his
<229 took courage <74 that he was about to go <153 <85 all
the land.

1:23 And now he did not tarry in the land of <70 but he did
<179 <26 with a <429 army, even towards the city of Bountiful; for
it was his determination to go <19 and cut his way through with the
sword, that he <497 obtain the north parts of the <59

1:24 And, <444 that <248 greatest <433 was in the center of
the <95 therefore he did <61 forth, giving them no time to assemble
themselves <273 save it were in small bodies; and in this manner
they did fall upon them and cut them down to the earth.

1:25 But behold, this <41 of <191 <80 the <54 of the
land gave Moronihah <329 advantage over <183 notwithstanding the
greatness of the number of the <197 who were slain.

1:26 For <36 <24 had <413 that the <413 <412 not
come into the <42 of the <95 but that they would <416 the cities
round <190 in the borders as they had hitherto done; <113
<36 had caused that <130 strong armies <507 maintain those
<148 <24 <24 by the borders.

1:27 But <59 the <55 were not frightened according to his
desire, but they had come into the <63 of the <63 and had taken
the capital city which was the city of <233 and were marching
<128 the most <15 <53 of the <25 slaying the people with a
<133 slaughter, both men, women, and children, taking <301 of
many <100 and of many strongholds.

1:28 But when <97 had discovered this, he immediately sent <257
Lehi with an army <98 <98 to head them <355 they <110 come to
the land Bountiful.

1:29 And thus he did; and he did head them <22 they came to the land
Bountiful, and gave unto them battle, <355 that they began to
retreat back <324 the land of Zarahemla.

1:30 And it came to pass that <76 did head them in <174 retreat,
and did give unto them <37 <37 that it became an exceedingly
bloody battle; yea, many were <434 and among the <252 who were
slain <277 was also found.

1:31 And now, <196 the <196 could not <67 either way,
neither on the north, nor on the south, nor on the east, nor on the
west, for they were surrounded on every hand by the Nephites.

1:32 And thus had <53 plunged the <44 into the midst of
the Nephites, <85 that they were in the power of the <10 and
he himself was <88 and the <26 did yield <396 into the
hands of the <47

1:33 And it came to pass that <138 took <231 of the city of
Zarahemla again, and <320 that the <35 who had been <284
prisoners <215 depart out of the land in peace.

1:34 And thus ended the forty and first year of the reign of the
judges.

Helaman Chapter 2

2:1 And it came to pass in the <28 and second year of the <28 of
the judges, after <77 had established again peace between the
<442 and the Lamanites, behold there was no one to fill the
judgment-seat; <412 <10 <259 to be a contention <26 <217 the
<351 concerning who <92 fill the judgment-seat.

2:2 And it came to pass that Helaman, who was the son of <6 was
appointed to fill the judgment-seat, by the voice of the people.

2:3 But <245 Kishkumen, who had murdered Pahoran, did lay wait to
destroy <113 also; and he was upheld by his band, who had entered
into a covenant that no one <70 know his wickedness.

2:4 For <92 was one Gadianton, who was <317 expert in many
words, and also in his craft, to carry on the secret work of murder and
of robbery; <122 he <344 the leader of the band of Kishkumen.

2:5 Therefore he did flatter them, and also <89 that if they
would place him in the judgment-seat he <7 grant unto those who
belonged to his band that they <83 be placed in <303 and authority
<167 the people; <56 Kishkumen sought to <118 Helaman.

2:6 And it came to pass as he went <502 <449 the <46 to
<20 <169 <214 one of the servants of <7 having been out
by night, and <7 obtained, through disguise, a knowledge of <67
plans which had been laid by this band to <34 Helaman—

2:7 And it came to pass that he met <107 and he gave unto him a
sign; <81 <81 made known unto him the object of his desire,
desiring that he <119 conduct him to the <80 that he might
<167 <102

2:8 And when the servant of <230 had <35 all the heart of
<53 and how that it was his <44 to murder, and also that it
was the <10 of all <98 who <164 to his band to <18 and to
rob, and to gain power, (and this was their <229 plan, and <4
combination) the <57 of <57 said unto Kishkumen: Let us go
<164 unto the <346

2:9 Now this did please <112 exceedingly, for he did suppose that
he <214 accomplish his design; but <333 the <38 of <180 as
they were going <36 unto the <358 did stab <30 even
to the heart, that he fell dead without a groan. And he ran and told
<69 all the things <197 he had seen, and heard, and done.

2:10 And it came to pass that <22 did send <50 to take this band
of robbers and <112 murderers, that they <177 be executed according
to the law.

2:11 But <86 when Gadianton had found that <76 did not return
he feared lest that he <107 be destroyed; <232 he caused that
his band <10 follow him. And they took <158 flight out of the land,
by a <58 way, into the wilderness; and thus when <78 sent <77
to take them they could nowhere be found.

2:12 And more of this <67 shall be spoken hereafter. And thus
ended the forty and second year of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

2:13 And <100 in the end of this book ye <38 see that this
<44 did prove the overthrow, yea, almost the entire destruction
of the <34 of <34

2:14 Behold I do not mean the end of the book of <226 but I mean
the end of the book of Nephi, from <204 I have taken all the account
<8 I have written.

<123 Chapter 3

3:1 And now it came to pass in the <108 and third year of the <108 of
the judges, there was no contention <499 the <78 of Nephi save it
were a little pride <49 was in the church, <5 did cause some
<12 dissensions <24 the people, <10 affairs were settled in the
ending of the <52 and <52 year.

3:2 And <50 was no <50 <26 the <50 in the <18 and
fourth year; neither was <16 much <15 in the <12 and fifth
<31

3:3 And it came to pass in the <16 and sixth, yea, <25 was much
<27 and many dissensions; in the <70 <11 were an exceedingly
great many who departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and went <266
unto the land northward to inherit the land.

3:4 And they did travel to an <34 <33 distance, insomuch that
they came to large bodies of water and many rivers.

3:5 Yea, and even they did spread <46 into all parts of the <332
into whatever <7 it had not been rendered desolate and <441
timber, because of the many inhabitants who had before inherited the
<69

3:6 And now no part of the land was desolate, save it were for timber;
but <32 of the greatness of the <300 of the <171 who had
<38 inhabited the land it was called desolate.

3:7 And <142 being but <221 timber upon the face of the <83
nevertheless the <31 who went <96 became <124 expert in the
working of cement; <450 they did build houses of cement, in the
<180 they did dwell.

3:8 And it came to pass that they did multiply and spread, and did go
<43 from the land southward to the land northward, and did <151
<175 that they began to cover the face of the whole earth, from the
sea south to the sea north, from the sea west to the sea east.

3:9 And the <94 who were in the land <234 did dwell in tents,
and in <91 of <91 and they did suffer whatsoever tree should
spring up upon the face of the land that it <12 grow up, that in
time they might have <149 to <125 their houses, yea, <3 cities,
and <4 temples, and <3 synagogues, and <3 sanctuaries, and all
manner of <7 buildings.

3:10 And it came to pass as <35 was <171 scarce in the land
<128 they did send <140 much by the way of shipping.

3:11 And thus they did enable the <109 in the land <107 that
they <74 <71 many <68 both of wood and of cement.

3:12 And it came to pass that <245 were many of the <33 of Ammon,
who were Lamanites by birth, did also go <62 into this <312

3:13 And now <27 are many records kept of the proceedings of this
<497 by many of this <5 <252 are particular and very large,
concerning them.

3:14 But behold, a hundredth part of the <30 of this <24
yea, the account of the <63 and of the Nephites, and <149 wars,
and contentions, and dissensions, and <8 preaching, and <3
prophecies, and <4 shipping and <3 building of ships, and <5
<6 of <188 and of synagogues and <9 <188 and <3
righteousness, and <4 wickedness, and <3 murders, and <3
robbings, and <4 plundering, and all <204 of abominations and
whoredoms, cannot be contained in this work.

3:15 But <92 <124 are many books and many <127 of every kind,
and they have been kept chiefly by the Nephites.

3:16 And they have been handed down from one generation to another by
the <111 even until they have fallen into transgression and have
been murdered, plundered, and hunted, and driven forth, and slain, and
scattered upon the face of the <379 and mixed with the <149
<34 they are no more <482 the <43 becoming wicked, and wild,
and ferocious, yea, even <9 Lamanites.

3:17 And now I return again to mine account; therefore, what I have
spoken had passed after <114 had been great <185 and
disturbances, and <193 and <190 among the <274 of Nephi.

3:18 The forty and sixth year of the reign of the judges ended;

3:19 And it came to pass that <43 was still <43 contention in the
land, yea, even in the <34 and seventh year, and also in the <8
and eighth year.

3:20 Nevertheless Helaman did fill the judgment-seat with justice and
equity; yea, he did observe to keep the statutes, and the judgments,
and the commandments of God; and he did do that <327 was right in the
sight of God continually; and he did walk <121 the ways of his father,
insomuch that he did prosper in the <379

3:21 And it came to pass that he had two sons. He gave unto the eldest
the name of Nephi, and unto the youngest, the name of Lehi. And they
began to grow up unto the Lord.

3:22 And it came to pass that the wars and contentions <21 to cease,
in a small degree, <187 the <187 of the <237 in the latter end
of the <148 and <147 year of the <190 of the <190 over the <23
of <211

3:23 And it came to pass in the <27 and ninth year of the <27 of
the judges, <207 was continual peace established in the <206 all save
it were the secret combinations <160 Gadianton the robber had
<18 in the more settled parts of the <23 <15 at that time
were not known unto those who were at the head of government; therefore
they were not destroyed out of the <173

3:24 And it came to pass that in this same year <72 was exceedingly
<280 prosperity in the church, <204 that <11 were thousands who
did join themselves unto the church and were baptized unto repentance.

3:25 And so <29 was the <31 of the <31 and so many the
blessings <87 were poured out upon the people, that even the high
priests and the teachers were <45 astonished beyond measure.

3:26 And it came to pass that the work of the Lord did <274 unto the
baptizing and uniting to the <71 of God, many souls, yea, even tens
of thousands.

3:27 Thus we may see that the Lord is merciful unto all who will, in
the sincerity of their hearts, call upon his holy name.

3:28 Yea, thus we see that the gate of heaven is open unto all, even to
<184 who will believe on the name of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of
God.

3:29 Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold upon the word of God,
<142 is quick and powerful, <5 shall divide asunder all the cunning
and the snares and the wiles of the devil, and lead the man of Christ
in a strait and narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery
<37 is prepared to engulf the wicked—

3:30 And land <118 <148 yea, <3 immortal <4 at the <465 hand
of God in the kingdom of heaven, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac,
and with Jacob, and with all our holy fathers, to go no more out.

3:31 And in this year <280 was <363 rejoicing in the land of
Zarahemla, and in all the regions round about, even in all the land
<84 was possessed by the Nephites.

3:32 And it came to pass that <39 was <401 and <332 <302 joy
in the remainder of the <426 and <426 year; yea, and also <20 was
<60 <22 and <21 joy in the fiftieth year of the <441 of the
judges.

3:33 And in the fifty and first year of the <18 of the <486 <36
was <35 also, save it were the pride <82 began to enter into the
church—not into the <314 of God, but into the hearts of the people
who professed to belong to the <17 of God—

3:34 And they were lifted up in pride, even to the persecution of many
of <199 brethren. Now this was a <95 evil, <57 did cause the more
humble part of the <48 to suffer <15 persecutions, and to wade
through much affliction.

3:35 Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and
<3 in <49 humility, and firmer and <2 in the faith of
<344 unto the filling <15 souls with joy and consolation, yea,
even to the purifying and the sanctification of <16 <400 <74
<6 cometh because of <8 yielding <2 <124 unto God.

3:36 And it came to pass that the <174 and second year ended in <167
<168 save it were the <229 <98 <170 <39 had gotten into
the <36 of the people; and it was <48 of <46 <19 <19
riches and <6 prosperity in the land; and it did grow upon them from
day to day.

3:37 And it came to pass in the <64 and third year of the <238 of
the judges, Helaman died, and his eldest son Nephi <235 to <14 in
his stead. And it came to pass that he did fill the judgment-seat with
justice and equity; yea, he did keep the commandments of God, and did
walk in the ways of his father.

<51 Chapter 4

4:1 And it came to pass in the <76 and fourth year <308 were many
dissensions in the church, and <9 was also a contention among the
people, insomuch that <11 was much bloodshed.

4:2 And the rebellious part were slain and driven out of the land, and
they did go unto the king of the Lamanites.

4:3 And it came to pass that they did endeavor to stir up the Lamanites
to war against the Nephites; but behold, the <10 were <192
afraid, <65 that they would not hearken to the words of those
dissenters.

4:4 But it came to pass in the <111 and sixth year of the <173 of the
<187 <98 were dissenters who went up from the Nephites unto the
Lamanites; and they succeeded with <42 others in stirring them up to
anger <72 the <72 and they were all that year preparing for
war.

4:5 And in the <57 and seventh year they did come down <28 the
<49 to battle, and they did commence the work of death; yea,
<105 that in the <28 and eighth year of the <85 of the <510
they <71 in obtaining possession of the land of Zarahemla; yea,
and also all the lands, even unto the land <352 was near the land
Bountiful.

4:6 And the <62 and the armies of Moronihah were <209 even into
the land of Bountiful;

4:7 And <139 they did fortify <89 the Lamanites, from the west
sea, even unto the east; it being a day’s journey for a Nephite, on the
line <61 they had fortified and stationed <398 <52 to defend
<5 north country.

4:8 And thus <170 <186 of the Nephites, with the help of a
numerous army of the <57 had obtained all the <118 of the
<92 <45 was in the land southward. And all this was done in the
<152 and <152 and ninth years of the <154 of the judges.

4:9 And it came to pass in the sixtieth year of the <19 of the
<258 <134 did succeed with his <89 in <177 many parts
of the <492 yea, they regained many cities <65 had fallen into the
hands of the <354

4:10 And it came to pass in the sixty and first year of the <51 of
the <225 they <224 in regaining even the half of all <140
possessions.

4:11 Now this great loss of the <140 and the <7 slaughter <59
was <443 them, <373 not have happened had it not been for <32
wickedness and <4 abomination <20 was <19 them; yea, and it was
<7 <179 also who professed to belong to the church of God.

4:12 And it was because of the pride of <35 hearts, <7 of <4
exceeding riches, yea, it was <9 of <9 oppression to the poor,
withholding <7 food from the hungry, <6 <6 clothing from
the naked, and smiting <8 humble brethren upon the cheek, making a
mock of that <79 was sacred, denying the spirit of prophecy and of
revelation, murdering, plundering, lying, stealing, committing
adultery, rising up in <123 contentions, and deserting away into the
land of Nephi, <103 the Lamanites—

4:13 And <76 of this <56 <23 wickedness, and <4 boastings in
<4 own strength, they were left in <7 own strength; therefore
they did not prosper, but were afflicted and smitten, and <383 before
the <311 until they had lost <311 of almost all <28
lands.

4:14 But behold, <273 did preach many things unto the people
<64 of <20 iniquity, and also Nephi and Lehi, who were the sons
of Helaman, did <24 many <24 unto the people, yea, and did
prophesy many <10 unto them concerning <31 iniquities, and what
should come unto them if they did not repent of <15 sins.

4:15 And it came to pass that they did repent, and inasmuch as they did
<23 they did begin to prosper.

4:16 For when <90 saw that they did <17 he did venture to lead
them forth from place to place, and from city to city, even <131 they
had <375 the one-half of <65 property and the <6 of all
<8 <138

4:17 And thus ended the <373 and <373 year of the <373 of the
<444

4:18 And it came to pass in the <22 and second year of the <22 of
the <446 that <84 could obtain no more possessions over the
<428

4:19 Therefore they did abandon <62 design to <19 the remainder of
<8 lands, for so numerous were the Lamanites that it became
impossible for the Nephites to <22 more power over <393 <256
<50 did employ all his <497 in maintaining <397 <497 <330 he
had taken.

4:20 And it came to pass, <239 of the greatness of the number of the
<51 the <45 were in <314 fear, lest they <220 be
overpowered, and trodden down, and slain, and destroyed.

4:21 Yea, they began to remember the prophecies of Alma, and also the
words of Mosiah; and they saw that they had been a stiffnecked <276
and that they had set at naught the commandments of God.

4:22 And that they had altered and trampled under <132 feet the laws
of Mosiah, or that <107 the Lord commanded him to give unto the
people; and they saw that <24 laws had become corrupted, and that
they had <7 a wicked <62 insomuch that they were <6 even
like unto the <197

4:23 And <138 of <32 iniquity the church had begun to dwindle; and
they <115 to disbelieve in the <495 of <495 and in the <6 of
revelation; and the judgments of God did stare them in the face.

4:24 And they saw that they had <69 weak, like unto <51 brethren,
the <461 and that the Spirit of the Lord did no more preserve
<235 yea, it had withdrawn from them <77 the <18 of the Lord
doth not dwell in unholy temples—

4:25 <292 the Lord did cease to <32 them by his miraculous
and matchless power, for they had fallen into a state of unbelief and
awful wickedness; and they saw that the <255 were exceedingly more
<314 than they, and except they <257 cleave unto the Lord <90
God, they must unavoidably perish.

4:26 For behold, they saw that the strength of the <36 was as
<290 as <26 strength, even man for man. And thus had they <67
into this <16 transgression; yea, thus had they <140 <140 <114
of <25 transgression, in the space of not many years.

Helaman Chapter 5

5:1 And it came to pass that in this same year, <68 Nephi delivered
up the judgment-seat to a man whose name was Cezoram.

5:2 For as <49 laws and <3 governments were established by the
voice of the <273 and they who chose evil were more <132 than
they who <9 good, <435 they were ripening for destruction, for
the laws had <93 corrupted.

5:3 Yea, and this was not all; they were a <377 <42 <315
that they could not be governed by the law nor justice, save it were to
<71 destruction.

5:4 And it came to pass that <105 had <49 weary <142 of <18
iniquity; and he yielded up the judgment-seat, and took it upon him to
preach the word of God all the remainder of his days, and his brother
Lehi also, all the <12 of his days;

5:5 For they remembered the <473 <428 <49 father <180 spake unto
them. And these are the <13 <13 he spake:

5:6 Behold, my sons, I desire that ye <272 <511 to keep the
<485 of God; and I would that ye <14 declare unto the people
<38 words. <29 I have given unto you the names of our first
parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done
that when you <51 your <25 ye may <5 <398 and when ye
<6 them ye may <4 <94 works; and when ye <6 <6
works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were
good.

5:7 Therefore, my <104 I <90 that ye <90 do that <121 is <249
that it may be said of you, and also <33 even as it has been said
and written of <151

5:8 And now my <40 behold I have somewhat more to <149 of you,
<43 <5 is, that ye may not do <138 things that ye may boast, but
that ye may do <12 <12 to lay up for yourselves a treasure in
heaven, yea, <33 is eternal, and <4 fadeth not away; yea, that ye
may have that precious gift of eternal life, <16 we have reason to
suppose hath been <187 to our fathers.

5:9 O remember, <1 my <85 the <241 <24 king Benjamin <253
unto his people; yea, <163 that there is no other way nor means
whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus
Christ, who shall come, yea, <28 that he cometh to redeem the
world.

5:10 And <14 also the <55 <55 Amulek <54 unto Zeezrom, in
the city of Ammonihah; for he said unto him that the Lord surely <198
come to <37 his <420 but that he <10 not come to <10 them
in <246 sins, but to <8 them from <7 sins.

5:11 And he hath power <125 unto him from the Father to <20 them
from <21 sins <427 of repentance; <492 he hath sent his
angels to <346 the tidings of the conditions of repentance, <87
bringeth unto the <38 of the Redeemer, unto the salvation of <34
souls.

5:12 And now, my <168 <171 <116 that it is upon the rock of
our <27 who is <148 the Son of God, that ye must build your
foundation; that when the devil <162 send forth his mighty winds, yea,
his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his <16
storm <23 beat upon you, it <5 have no <80 over you to drag you
down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, <120 of the rock upon
<107 ye are built, <4 is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if
men <76 they cannot fall.

5:13 And it came to pass that <335 were the <227 <29 Helaman taught
to his sons; yea, he did teach them many <351 <14 are not <406
and also many <9 <9 are written.

5:14 And they did <148 his words; and <193 they went forth,
keeping the commandments of God, to <38 the word of God among all the
people of Nephi, beginning at the city Bountiful;

5:15 And from thenceforth to the city of Gid; and from the city of Gid
to the city of Mulek;

5:16 And even from one city to another, until they had gone <188 <52
all the <52 of Nephi who were in the land southward; and from thence
into the land of Zarahemla, <22 the Lamanites.

5:17 And it came to pass that they did preach with great power,
insomuch that they did confound many of those dissenters who had gone
over from the Nephites, <17 that they came <64 and did confess
<300 sins and were baptized unto <320 and immediately returned
to the Nephites to endeavor to repair unto them the wrongs <172 they
had done.

5:18 And it came to pass that <99 and Lehi did <72 unto the
Lamanites with such <77 <277 and authority, for they had <6 and
<7 <404 unto them that they might speak, and they also had
what they <443 speak <16 unto them—

5:19 Therefore they did <11 unto the <40 astonishment of the
Lamanites, to the convincing them, <107 that there were eight
thousand of the <62 who were in the land of Zarahemla and round
about <115 unto <115 and were convinced of the wickedness of
the traditions of <133 fathers.

5:20 And it came to pass that <108 and Lehi did proceed from <204 to
go to the land of Nephi.

5:21 And it came to pass that they were taken by an army of the
<72 and cast into prison; yea, even in that same prison in <169
Ammon and his brethren were cast by the servants of Limhi.

5:22 And after they had been cast into <26 many days without food,
behold, they went <229 into the <12 to take them that they <169
slay them.

5:23 And it came to pass that <102 and Lehi were encircled <134 as if
by fire, even <161 that they durst not lay <132 hands upon them
for fear lest they <201 be burned. Nevertheless, <31 and Lehi were
not burned; and they were as standing in the midst of fire and were not
<23

5:24 And when they saw that they were <60 <60 with a pillar of
<61 and that it burned them not, <60 hearts did take courage.

5:25 For they saw that the <160 <78 not lay <18 <78 upon
them; neither <9 they come near unto <257 but stood as if they were
struck dumb with amazement.

5:26 And it came to pass that <98 and Lehi did stand <157 and began
to <301 unto <34 saying: Fear not, for <172 it is God that has
shown unto you this marvelous thing, in the <217 is <10 unto you
that ye cannot lay your <75 on us to slay us.

5:27 And <37 when they had said these words, the earth shook
exceedingly, and the walls of the <220 did shake as if they were
<143 to tumble to the earth; but <32 they did not fall. And
<7 they that were in the <28 were <138 and <466 who
were dissenters.

5:28 And it came to pass that they were overshadowed with a cloud of
darkness, and an awful solemn fear came upon <274

5:29 And it came to pass that <421 came a voice as if it were above
the <33 of <32 <146 Repent ye, repent ye, and seek no more
to destroy my <347 whom I have sent unto you to declare good
tidings.

5:30 And it came to pass when they heard this voice, and beheld that it
was not a <58 of thunder, <237 was it a <7 of a <504
tumultuous noise, but <128 it was a still <13 of perfect mildness,
as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul—

5:31 And notwithstanding the mildness of the <60 behold the <198
<199 <198 and the <198 of the <170 trembled again, as if it
were <198 to <198 to the <198 and <26 the <130 of <130
<258 had <172 <281 did not disperse—

5:32 And <18 the <78 came <35 <148 <148 ye, <148 ye, for
the kingdom of heaven is at hand; and seek no more to <156 my
servants. And it came to pass that the <77 <76 <33 and the <76
trembled.

5:33 And also again the third time the <52 came, and did <350 unto
them <336 words <76 <327 be uttered by man; and the <32 did
tremble <39 and the <44 <44 as if it were <110 to divide
asunder.

5:34 And it came to pass that the <302 could not flee because of
the <125 of darkness <48 did overshadow <446 yea, and also they
were immovable <18 of the fear <15 did come upon <299

5:35 Now <294 was one among them who was a Nephite by birth, who had
once belonged to the church of God but had dissented from <31

5:36 And it came to pass that he turned him about, and <259 he saw
through the <75 of <75 the faces of <492 and Lehi; and <16
they did shine <238 even as the <15 of angels. And he <311
that they did lift their eyes to heaven; and they were in the attitude
as if talking or lifting <16 voices to some being whom they beheld.

5:37 And it came to pass that this man did cry unto the multitude, that
they might turn and look. And <69 <127 was power given unto them
that they did turn and look; and they did <280 the <79 of <94 and
Lehi.

5:38 And they said unto the man: Behold, what do all these things mean,
and who is it with whom <10 men do converse?

5:39 Now the man’s name was Aminadab. And Aminadab said unto them: They
do converse with the angels of God.

5:40 And it came to pass that the Lamanites said unto him: What shall
we do, that this cloud of darkness may be removed from overshadowing
us?

5:41 And <50 said unto <50 You must repent, and cry unto the
voice, even until ye <37 have faith in Christ, who was taught unto
you by Alma, and Amulek, and Zeezrom; and when ye <20 do this, the
<56 of <56 <8 be <56 from <56 you.

5:42 And it came to pass that they all did begin to cry unto the voice
of him who had shaken the earth; yea, they did cry even <68 the <43
of <44 was dispersed.

5:43 And it came to pass that when they cast their eyes about, and saw
that the <27 of <26 was dispersed from <69 them,
behold, they saw that they were encircled <22 yea every soul, by a
pillar of fire.

5:44 And Nephi and Lehi were in the midst of them; yea, they were
<29 about; yea, they were as if in the <16 of a flaming fire,
yet it did harm them not, neither did it take hold upon the walls of
the prison; and they were filled with that joy which is unspeakable and
full of glory.

5:45 And <88 the Holy Spirit of God did come down from heaven, and
did enter into <121 hearts, and they were <38 as if with <65 and
they could speak forth marvelous words.

5:46 And it came to pass that there came a <187 unto <139 yea, a
pleasant <250 as if it were a whisper, saying:

5:47 Peace, peace be unto you, because of your <264 in my Well
Beloved, who was from the foundation of the world.

5:48 And now, when they heard this they cast up <85 eyes as if to
behold from whence the <64 came; and <114 they saw the heavens
open; and <370 came down out of heaven and ministered unto them.

5:49 And <93 were about three hundred souls who saw and <50 <420
things; and they were bidden to go <125 and marvel not, <192 should
they doubt.

5:50 And it came to pass that they did go forth, and did minister unto
the people, declaring throughout all the regions round <53 all the
<478 <210 they had <54 and seen, insomuch that the more part of
the <445 were convinced of <166 <145 of the greatness of the
evidences <27 they had received.

5:51 And as many as were <24 did lay down <140 weapons of war,
and also <7 hatred and the tradition of <6 fathers.

5:52 And it came to pass that they did yield up unto the Nephites the
lands of <23 possession.

Helaman Chapter 6

6:1 And it came to pass that when the sixty and second year of the
reign of the judges had ended, all <164 <116 had happened and the
<107 had become, the more part of <110 a righteous <143
<127 that <55 righteousness did exceed that of the <67
<125 of <11 firmness and <3 steadiness in the faith.

6:2 For <242 <220 were many of the <23 who had become hardened
and impenitent and grossly wicked, <43 that they did reject the
word of God and all the preaching and prophesying <165 did come among
<263

6:3 Nevertheless, the people of the church did have great joy <68
of the conversion of the Lamanites, yea, <9 of the <17 of God,
<36 had been established <37 <36 And they did fellowship one with
another and did rejoice one with another, and did have <41 joy.

6:4 And it came to pass that many of the <145 did come down into
the land of Zarahemla, and did declare unto the <77 of the <119
the manner of <140 conversion, and did exhort them to <419 and
repentance.

6:5 Yea, and many did preach with exceedingly <60 power and
authority, unto the bringing down many of them into the depths of
humility, to be the humble followers of God and the Lamb.

6:6 And it came to pass that many of the <86 did go into the land
northward; and also Nephi and Lehi went into the land northward, to
<64 unto the people. And thus ended the <280 and third year.

6:7 And <230 <230 was peace in all the land, <221 that the
<117 did go into whatsoever part of the land they would, whether
<182 the <15 or the Lamanites.

6:8 And it came to pass that the <79 did also go whithersoever
they <27 <27 it were <28 the <13 or <4 the Nephites;
and thus they did have free intercourse one with <212 to buy and to
sell, and to get gain, according to <183 desire.

6:9 And it came to pass that they became <176 rich, both the
<47 and the <46 and they did have an exceeding plenty of
gold, and of silver, and of all <224 of precious metals, both in the
land south and in the land north.

6:10 Now the land <13 was called Lehi and the land north was <7
Mulek, <317 was after the son of Zedekiah; for the Lord did bring
Mulek into the land north, and Lehi into the land south.

6:11 And <185 <185 was all <67 of gold in both <469 lands, and
of <81 and of <78 ore of every kind; and <22 were also
curious workmen, who did work all kinds of ore and did refine it; and
thus they did <451 rich.

6:12 They did raise grain in abundance, both in the <94 and in the
south; and they did flourish exceedingly, both in the <14 and in the
<85 And they did multiply and wax <174 strong in the land.
And they did <42 many flocks and herds, yea, many fatlings.

6:13 Behold <210 women did toil and spin, and did make all <114 of
cloth, of fine-twined linen and cloth of <108 kind, to clothe <24
nakedness. And thus the <332 and fourth year did pass away in peace.

6:14 And in the <16 and fifth year they did also have <425 joy and
peace, yea, much preaching and many prophecies concerning that <204
was to come. And thus passed away the <31 and <31 <379

6:15 And it came to pass that in the <16 and sixth year of the reign
of the judges, <212 Cezoram was murdered by an unknown hand as he
sat upon the judgment-seat. And it came to pass that in the same year,
that his son, who had been appointed by the people in his stead, was
also murdered. And thus <453 the <58 and <58 <74

6:16 And in the commencement of the <14 and seventh year the <31
began to grow <197 wicked again.

6:17 For <79 the Lord had blessed them so long with the riches of
the world that they had not been stirred up to anger, to wars, nor to
bloodshed; therefore they <43 to set <194 hearts upon <3 riches;
yea, they <11 to seek to get gain that they might be lifted up one
above another; <29 they <18 to commit secret murders, and to
rob and to plunder, that they <24 get gain.

6:18 And now <84 those murderers and plunderers were a band who had
been formed by Kishkumen and Gadianton. And now it had come to pass
that <378 were many, even among the Nephites, of Gadianton’s band. But
<38 they were more numerous <13 the more <137 part of the
Lamanites. And they were <462 <22 robbers and murderers.

6:19 And it was they who did murder the chief judge Cezoram, and his
son, while in the judgment-seat; and <46 they were not found.

6:20 And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that <79
were <51 <66 them they were <205 sorrowful; and they did
use <367 means in <169 power to destroy them off the face of the
earth.

6:21 But <56 Satan did stir up the <194 of the more part of the
<122 insomuch that they did unite with <160 bands of robbers, and
did enter into <47 covenants and <3 oaths, that they would protect
and preserve one another in whatsoever difficult circumstances they
should be placed, that they <5 not suffer for <26 <219 and
<4 plunderings, and <3 stealings.

6:22 And it came to pass that they did have <15 signs, yea, <3
<246 <5 and <5 <4 words; and this that they <245
distinguish a brother who had entered into the covenant, that
<64 wickedness his <12 <58 do he <3 not be injured by
his brother, nor by <105 who did belong to his band, who had taken
this covenant.

6:23 And thus they <50 murder, and <301 and steal, and <314
whoredoms and all manner of wickedness, contrary to the laws of <77
country and also the laws of <8 God.

6:24 And whosoever of <57 who belonged to <13 band <73 reveal
unto the <404 of <9 <87 and <3 abominations, <12 be
tried, not according to the laws of <12 country, but <8 to the
laws of <9 <61 which had been given by Gadianton and
Kishkumen.

6:25 Now <236 it is these <150 oaths and <212 <22 Alma
commanded his son <49 not go forth unto the world, lest they <9
be a <282 of bringing down the <505 unto destruction.

6:26 Now <40 <94 <38 <38 and <38 did not come <32
unto <61 from the records <48 were delivered unto Helaman; but
<23 they were put into the heart of <19 by that same being
who did entice our first parents to partake of the forbidden fruit—

6:27 Yea, that same <21 who did plot with Cain, that if he <304
<413 his <233 Abel it <89 not be known unto the world. And he
did plot with Cain and his followers from that time forth.

6:28 And also it is that same <47 who put it into the <379 of the
<121 to build a tower sufficiently high that they <252 get to
heaven. And it was that same <29 who led on the <24 who came from
that <26 into this land; who spread the works of darkness and
abominations over all the face of the land, until he dragged the <30
down to an entire destruction, and to an everlasting hell.

6:29 Yea, it is that same <56 who put it into the <165 of <165
to still carry on the work of darkness, and of <206 murder; and he
has brought it <207 from the beginning of man even down to this time.

6:30 And <209 it is he who is the author of all sin. And <12 he
doth <48 on his <101 of <101 and <47 <385 and doth hand
down <318 plots, and <3 <508 and <3 covenants, and <3 plans
of awful <331 from generation to <2 <343 as he can
get hold upon the <181 of the children of men.

6:31 And now <58 he had got great hold upon the <20 of the
Nephites; yea, insomuch that they had become exceedingly wicked; yea,
the more part of them had turned out of the way of righteousness, and
did trample under <72 feet the commandments of God, and did turn unto
<11 own ways, and did <244 up unto themselves idols of <11 gold
and <4 silver.

6:32 And it came to pass that all <419 iniquities did come unto them
in the space of not many years, <80 that a more part of it had
come unto them in the sixty and seventh year of the reign of the judges
over the <256 of Nephi.

6:33 And they did grow in <66 <53 in the <29 and eighth year
also.

6:34 And thus we see that the Nephites did begin to dwindle in
unbelief, and grow in wickedness and abominations, while the Lamanites
began to grow <155 in the knowledge of <46 God; yea, they did
<30 to keep his statutes and commandments, and to walk in truth and
uprightness before him.

6:35 And thus we see that the Spirit of the Lord <45 to withdraw from
the Nephites, because of the <62 and the hardness of <52
hearts.

6:36 And thus we see that the Lord <29 to pour out his <38 upon
the Lamanites, <32 of <26 easiness and willingness to believe in
his words.

6:37 And it came to pass that the <109 did hunt the band of
robbers of Gadianton; and they did preach the word of God among the
more wicked part of them, <210 that this band of <24 was
utterly destroyed from <19 the Lamanites.

6:38 And it came to pass on the other hand, that the <180 did <278
them up and support <38 <425 at the more <46 part of <8
<490 they had overspread all the land of the <138 and had seduced
the more part of the righteous <20 they had come down to <115 in
<123 <432 and partake of <5 spoils, and to join with them in <8
<442 murders and combinations.

6:39 And thus they did obtain the sole management of the government,
<111 that they did <380 <380 <28 feet and smite and rend and
turn <9 backs upon the poor and the meek, and the humble followers
of God.

6:40 And thus we see that they were in an <485 state, and ripening for
an everlasting destruction.

6:41 And it came to pass that thus ended the <343 and <343 year of
the <373 of the <373 over the <372 of <372

Helaman Chapter 7

7:1 Behold, now it came to pass in the <34 and ninth year of the
<34 of the <34 over the <34 of the <170 that Nephi, the
son of Helaman, returned to the land of Zarahemla from the land
northward.

7:2 For he had been forth <243 the <33 who were in the land
northward, and did <279 the word of God unto <227 and did prophesy
many things unto them;

7:3 And they did reject all his words, <181 that he could not stay
<45 <28 but <68 again unto the land of his nativity.

7:4 And seeing the <61 in a state of such <169 wickedness, and
those Gadianton <324 filling the judgment-seats—having usurped the
power and authority of the land; laying aside the commandments of God,
and not in the least aright <459 him; doing no justice unto the
children of men;

7:5 Condemning the <306 <422 of <249 righteousness; letting
the guilty and the <341 go unpunished <13 of <13 money; and
moreover to be held in office at the head of <293 to rule and do
according to <22 wills, that they might get gain and glory of the
world, and, moreover, that they <13 the more easily commit adultery,
and steal, and kill, and do <32 to <32 own wills—

7:6 Now this great iniquity had come upon the <231 in the space of
not many years; and when Nephi saw it, his heart was swollen with
sorrow within his breast; and he did exclaim in the agony of his soul:

7:7 Oh, that I <203 have had my days in the days when my father <41
first came out of the land of Jerusalem, that I <23 have joyed with
him in the promised <189 then were his <217 easy to be entreated,
firm to keep the <199 of God, and slow to be led to do
iniquity; and they were quick to hearken unto the words of the Lord—

7:8 Yea, if my days <55 have been in <253 days, then would my soul
have had joy in the righteousness of my brethren.

7:9 But behold, I am consigned that these are my <28 and that my soul
shall be filled with <142 <234 of this the wickedness of my
<33

7:10 And <33 now it came to pass that it was upon a tower, which
was in the garden of <425 <8 was by the highway <5 led to the
chief market, <7 was in the city of Zarahemla; therefore, <165 had
bowed himself upon the tower <16 was in his garden, <5 <7 was
also near unto the <44 gate by <11 led the highway.

7:11 And it came to pass that there were certain men passing by and saw
<47 as he was pouring out his soul unto God upon the tower; and they
ran and told the <207 what they had seen, and the <7 came
together in multitudes that they <329 know the cause of so <311
mourning for the <143 of the people.

7:12 And now, when <57 arose he beheld the <30 of <37 who
had gathered together.

7:13 And it came to pass that he opened his mouth and said unto them:
Behold, why have ye <25 yourselves together? That I may tell you
of your iniquities?

7:14 Yea, <211 I have got upon my <149 that I <84 pour out my
soul unto my God, <18 of the exceeding <234 of my heart, <159 is
<11 of your iniquities!

7:15 And <9 of my <108 and lamentation ye have <63
<64 together, and do marvel; yea, and ye have <126 need to
<9 yea, ye ought to marvel <29 ye are given away that the
devil has got so <22 hold upon your hearts.

7:16 Yea, how <345 you have <23 way to the enticing of him who is
seeking to hurl away your souls down to everlasting misery and endless
wo?

7:17 O repent ye, <2 ye! Why will ye die? Turn ye, turn ye unto the
Lord your God. Why has he forsaken you?

7:18 It is <84 you have hardened your hearts; yea, ye will not
<432 unto the voice of the good shepherd; yea, ye have provoked him
to anger against you.

7:19 And <382 instead of gathering you, except ye will repent,
<10 he <413 scatter you forth that ye <6 become meat for dogs
and wild beasts.

7:20 O, how <128 you have forgotten your God in the very day that he
has delivered you?

7:21 But <44 it is to get gain, to be praised of men, yea, and that
ye <246 get gold and silver. And ye have set your hearts upon the
riches and the vain things of this world, for the <253 ye do murder,
and plunder, and steal, and bear false witness <114 your neighbor,
and do all manner of iniquity.

7:22 And for this <381 wo <108 come unto you <125 ye <6 repent.
For if ye will not <132 <87 this <249 city, and also all those
<7 cities <58 are round about, <4 are in the land of our
possession, <33 be taken away that ye <6 have no place in them;
for <38 the Lord will not grant unto you strength, as he has
hitherto done, to withstand <89 your enemies.

7:23 For <25 thus saith the Lord: I will not show unto the wicked
of my <32 to one more than the other, save it be unto <82 that
<294 of their sins, and <261 unto my words. Now therefore, I would
that ye should <46 my brethren, that it <84 be better for the
Lamanites than for you <135 ye <12 <135

7:24 For <24 they are more righteous than you, for they have not
sinned <91 that <139 knowledge <135 ye have received; therefore
the Lord will be merciful unto <127 yea, he will lengthen out <74
days and increase <5 seed, even when thou shalt be utterly destroyed
<59 thou <7 <59

7:25 Yea, wo be unto you <371 of that <51 abomination <51 has
come among you; and ye have united <489 unto it, yea, to that
secret band <19 was established by Gadianton!

7:26 Yea, wo <105 come unto you <39 of that pride <19 ye have
suffered to enter your hearts, <9 has lifted you up beyond that
<8 is good <24 of your exceedingly <64 riches!

7:27 Yea, wo be unto you <15 of your wickedness and abominations!

7:28 And <102 ye <195 ye <58 perish; yea, even your lands <6
be <272 from you, and ye <8 be <124 from off the face of the
earth.

7:29 Behold now, I do not say that these <379 <24 be, of myself,
<58 it is not of myself that I know <16 things; but <211 I
know that <8 <24 are true <21 the Lord God has made them
known unto me, <210 I testify that they <42 be.

Helaman Chapter 8

8:1 And now it came to pass that when Nephi had said <43 words,
<51 there were men who were judges, who also belonged to the <189
band of Gadianton, and they were angry, and they cried out <274 him,
saying unto the people: Why do ye not seize upon this man and bring him
forth, that he may be condemned according to the crime <193 he has
done?

8:2 Why seest thou this man, and hearest him revile <47 this people
and <5 our law?

8:3 For <85 <92 had spoken unto them concerning the corruptness
of <318 law; yea, many <145 did <16 speak <50 cannot be written;
and nothing did he <10 <10 was contrary to the commandments of God.

8:4 And <433 judges were angry with him <175 he spake plainly unto
them <49 <45 <130 works of darkness; nevertheless, they
durst not lay <11 own hands upon him, for they feared the <87 lest
they <452 cry out <91 them.

8:5 Therefore they did cry unto the people, saying: Why do you suffer
this man to <119 <23 us? For behold he doth condemn all this
<21 even unto destruction; yea, and also that <212 our <343
cities <240 be <313 from us, that we <7 have no place in <57

8:6 And now we know that this is impossible, for <155 we are
powerful, and our <34 great, <280 our enemies can have no power
over us.

8:7 And it came to pass that thus they did stir up the <114 to anger
<88 Nephi, and raised contentions <474 them; for <286 were some
who did cry out: Let this man alone, for he is a good man, and <179
<208 <195 he saith will surely come to pass <427 we repent;

8:8 Yea, <85 all the judgments will come upon us <24 he has
testified unto us; for we know that he has <9 aright unto us
<211 our iniquities. And <161 they are many, and he knoweth as
well all <58 <34 <147 befall us as he <12 of our iniquities;

8:9 Yea, and <58 if he had not been a prophet he could not have
<50 <46 <92 things.

8:10 And it came to pass that <12 <136 who sought to destroy <314
were compelled <287 of <270 fear, that they did not lay <7 <276
on him; <185 he began again to <326 unto them, seeing that he had
gained favor in the eyes of some, insomuch that the remainder of them
did fear.

8:11 <293 he was constrained to <33 more unto them <295
Behold, my brethren, have ye not read that God gave <233 unto one man,
even Moses, to smite upon the waters of the Red Sea, and they parted
hither and thither, <57 that the Israelites, who were our fathers,
came through upon dry ground, and the <28 closed upon the armies of
the Egyptians and swallowed them up?

8:12 And now <163 if God gave unto this man such power, then why
<393 ye dispute <277 yourselves, and say that he hath given unto me
no <85 whereby I may know <181 the <252 that <214 come
upon you <270 ye repent?

8:13 But, <49 ye not only deny my words, but ye also deny all the
words <243 have been spoken by our <98 and also the <11 <11
were <11 by this man, <134 who had such <421 <60 <66 unto
him, yea, the <20 <20 he hath <20 <67 the coming of the
Messiah.

8:14 Yea, did he not bear record that the Son of God <109 come? And
as he lifted up the brazen serpent in the wilderness, even so <101 he
be <14 up who <23 come.

8:15 And as many as <10 look upon that <27 <5 live, even so
as many as <8 look upon the Son of God with faith, having a
contrite spirit, might <22 even unto that life <92 is eternal.

8:16 And now <147 Moses did not only testify of these things, but
also all the holy prophets, from his days even to the days of Abraham.

8:17 Yea, and <31 Abraham saw of his coming, and was filled with
gladness and did rejoice.

8:18 Yea, and <439 I say unto you, that <26 not only knew of
<57 <57 but there were many before the days of <16 who were
called by the order of God; yea, even after the <7 of his Son; and
this that it <126 be shown unto the people, a <214 many thousand
years <39 his <75 that even redemption <18 come unto them.

8:19 And now I would that ye <14 know, that even since the days of
<64 <72 have been many prophets that have <492 <83 things;
yea, <120 the <505 Zenos did <151 boldly; for the <169 he was
slain.

8:20 And <19 also Zenock, and also Ezias, and also Isaiah, and
Jeremiah, (Jeremiah being that same <33 who <42 of the
destruction of Jerusalem) and now we know that Jerusalem was destroyed
according to the <309 of Jeremiah. O then why not the Son of God come,
<16 to his prophecy?

8:21 And now will you <414 that <34 was destroyed? Will ye say
that the sons of Zedekiah were not slain, all <405 it were Mulek?
Yea, and do ye not <208 that the seed of <20 are with us, and
they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem? But <111 this is not
all—

8:22 Our father Lehi was <22 out of <64 because he <113
of <157 things. Nephi also <7 of <6 <246 and also almost
all of our <445 even down to this time; yea, they have <20 of
the <427 of Christ, and have looked forward, and have rejoiced in his
day <186 is to <400

8:23 And <74 he is God, and he is with them, and he did manifest
himself unto <8 that they were redeemed by him; and they gave unto
him glory, <86 of that <42 is to <42

8:24 And now, seeing ye know <91 things and cannot deny them <157
ye <469 lie, therefore in this ye have sinned, for ye have rejected
all <23 <114 notwithstanding so many evidences <42 ye have
received; yea, even ye have received all <16 both <41 in heaven,
and all <6 <20 are in the earth, as a witness that they are true.

8:25 But <112 ye have <49 the truth, and rebelled against your
holy God; and even at this time, instead of laying up for yourselves
treasures in <49 where nothing doth corrupt, and <5 <5 can
come <55 is unclean, ye are heaping up for <23 wrath <40
the day of judgment.

8:26 Yea, even at this time ye are ripening, <148 of your murders
and your fornication and wickedness, for everlasting destruction; yea,
and <142 ye repent it will come unto you soon.

8:27 Yea, <303 it is now even at your doors; yea, go ye in unto the
judgment-seat, and search; and <115 your judge is murdered, and he
lieth in his blood; and he hath been murdered by his brother, who
seeketh to sit in the judgment-seat.

8:28 And <33 they both belong to your secret band, whose author is
Gadianton and the evil one who <29 to destroy the souls of men.

Helaman Chapter 9

9:1 Behold, now it came to pass that when <352 had spoken <237 words,
certain men who were among them ran to the judgment-seat; yea, even
there were five who went, and they said <17 themselves, as they went:

9:2 <44 now we will know of a surety whether this man be a prophet
and God hath commanded him to prophesy such marvelous <269 unto us.
<28 we do not believe that he hath; yea, we do not <8 that he
is a prophet; nevertheless, if this thing <240 he has said concerning
the chief <169 be true, that he be dead, then will we <29 that the
other words <24 he has <112 are <313

9:3 And it came to pass that they ran in their might, and came in unto
the <123 and <183 the <48 <48 had fallen to the <352
and did lie in his blood.

9:4 And now <22 when they saw this they were astonished
exceedingly, insomuch that they fell to the earth; for they had not
believed the <76 <76 <188 had <76 <100 the <51 judge.

9:5 But now, when they saw they believed, and fear came upon them lest
all the judgments <29 <29 had <29 should come upon the people;
<472 they did quake, and had <87 to the earth.

9:6 Now, immediately when the <101 had been murdered—he being stabbed
by his brother by a garb of secrecy, and he fled, and the servants ran
and told the people, raising the cry of murder <249 them;

9:7 And <378 the people did gather themselves together unto the place
of the judgment-seat—and <135 to <169 astonishment they saw those
five men who had <77 to the <77

9:8 And now <22 the <36 knew <480 <133 the multitude
who had gathered <42 at the garden of Nephi; <111 they said
<65 themselves: These men are they who have <409 the judge, and
God has smitten them that they could not flee from us.

9:9 And it came to pass that they laid hold on them, and bound them and
cast them into prison. And <371 was a proclamation sent abroad that
the <155 was slain, and that the murderers had been taken and were
cast into <26

9:10 And it came to pass that on the morrow the <108 did assemble
<145 <103 to mourn and to fast, at the burial of the great
<254 <49 who had been slain.

9:11 And thus also <157 judges who were at the <132 of Nephi, and
heard his <469 were also <146 <43 at the burial.

9:12 And it came to pass that they inquired <152 the <225 saying:
Where are the five who were sent to inquire <183 the <62 <62
<468 he was dead? And they answered and said: Concerning this five
whom ye say ye have sent, we know not; but <145 are five who are the
murderers, whom we have cast into <134

9:13 And it came to pass that the <99 desired that they <344 be
brought; and they were brought, and <290 they were the five who were
sent; and <10 the <25 <94 of them to know, <84 the
matter, and they told them all that they had done, <108

9:14 We ran and came to the <323 of the judgment-seat, and when we saw
all things even as <411 had testified, we were <464 <462
that we fell to the <463 and when we were recovered from our
astonishment, <68 they cast us into <108

9:15 Now, as for the <390 of this man, we know not who has done it;
and only this much we <92 we ran and came according as ye desired,
and <42 he was dead, <10 to the words of Nephi.

9:16 And now it came to pass that the <130 did expound the matter
unto the <228 and did cry out against <261 <126 Behold, we know
that this <109 must have agreed with some one to slay the <396 and
then he might declare it unto us, that he <7 convert us unto his
faith, that he <9 raise himself to be a <329 man, chosen of God,
and a prophet.

9:17 And now <470 we will detect this man, and he shall confess his
fault and make known unto us the true murderer of this judge.

9:18 And it came to pass that the five were liberated on the day of the
<353 Nevertheless, they did rebuke the <124 in the <142 which
they had spoken <120 <120 and did contend with them one by one,
<225 that they did confound them.

9:19 <35 they caused that <136 <310 be <468 and <497 and
brought before the multitude, and they began to question him in divers
ways that they <129 cross him, that they <5 accuse him to death—

9:20 Saying unto him: Thou art confederate; who is this man that hath
done this murder? Now tell us, and acknowledge thy fault; saying,
Behold here is money; and also we will grant unto thee thy life if thou
wilt tell us, and <25 the agreement <116 thou hast made with
him.

9:21 But <98 said unto them: O ye fools, ye uncircumcised of heart,
ye blind, and ye stiffnecked <265 do ye know how long the Lord your
God will suffer you that ye <207 go on in this your way of sin?

9:22 O ye ought to begin to howl and mourn, because of the <255
destruction <73 at this time doth await you, except ye <37 repent.

9:23 <111 ye say that I have <313 with a man that he <185 <395
Seezoram, our chief <253 But <278 I say unto you, that this is
<50 I have testified unto you that ye <182 know <495 this
thing; yea, even for a witness unto you, that I did know of the
wickedness and abominations <75 are among you.

9:24 And <40 I have done this, ye say that I have <73 with a man
that he <74 do this <47 yea, <22 I showed unto you this sign
ye are angry with me, and seek to destroy my life.

9:25 And now <96 I will show unto you another sign, and see if ye
will in this thing seek to <28 me.

9:26 <141 I say unto you: Go to the house of Seantum, who is the
brother of <143 and say unto him—

9:27 Has <366 the pretended prophet, who doth prophesy so much evil
<140 this <240 <103 with thee, in the <127 ye have murdered
<34 who is your brother?

9:28 And <86 he <210 say unto you, Nay.

9:29 And ye <11 say unto him: Have ye <31 your <27

9:30 And he <15 stand with fear, and wist not what to say. And
<40 he <14 deny unto you; and he <6 make as if he were
astonished; nevertheless, he <10 declare unto you that he is
innocent.

9:31 But <32 ye <16 examine him, and ye <5 find blood upon the
skirts of his cloak.

9:32 And when ye have seen <227 ye <21 say: From whence cometh this
blood? Do we not know that it is the <35 of your <98

9:33 And then <26 he tremble, and <4 look pale, even as if death
had come upon him.

9:34 And then <18 ye say: Because of this fear and this paleness
<174 has come upon your face, <93 we know that thou art guilty.

9:35 And then <30 greater fear come upon him; and then <8 he
confess unto you, and deny no more that he has done this murder.

9:36 And then <22 he say unto you, that I, <249 know nothing
<242 the matter save it were given unto me by the power of God.
And then <28 ye know that I am an honest man, and that I am sent unto
you from God.

9:37 And it came to pass that they went and did, even according as
Nephi had said unto them. And <114 the words <123 he had said were
true; for <20 to the <12 he did deny; and also <9 to the
<10 he did confess.

9:38 And he was brought to prove that he himself was the very murderer,
insomuch that the five were set at liberty, and also was Nephi.

9:39 And there were some of the Nephites who believed on the <49 of
Nephi; and <15 were some also, who <13 <474 of the testimony
of the five, for they had been converted while they were in prison.

9:40 And now <30 were some among the <413 who said that <123 was
a prophet.

9:41 And <19 were others who said: Behold, he is a god, for except he
was a god he could not know of all things. For <152 he has told us
the thoughts of our hearts, and also has told us things; and even he
has <139 unto our knowledge the true murderer of our chief judge.

Helaman Chapter 10

10:1 And it came to pass that <74 arose a division <94 the <94
<163 that they divided hither and thither and went their ways,
leaving <105 alone, as he was standing in the midst of <234

10:2 And it came to pass that <21 went his way towards his own house,
pondering upon the things <253 the Lord had shown unto him.

10:3 And it came to pass as he was thus pondering—being much cast down
<197 of the wickedness of the people of the Nephites, <73 secret
works of darkness, and <7 murderings, and <3 plunderings, and all
manner of iniquities—and it came to pass as he was thus <65 in
his heart, <170 a voice came unto him saying:

10:4 Blessed art thou, <400 for those <84 <84 thou hast done;
for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word,
<18 I have <415 unto thee, unto this people. And thou hast not
feared them, and hast not sought thine own life, but hast <6 my
will, and to keep my commandments. <204 10:5 And now, <115 thou
hast done this with such unwearyingness, <83 I will bless thee
forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and
in works; yea, even that all <94 <477 be done unto thee <419
to thy <87 for thou shalt not ask that <92 is contrary to my will.

10:6 <328 thou art <127 and I am God. <8 I declare it unto
thee in the presence of mine angels, that ye <49 have power over this
<282 and <8 smite the earth with famine, and with pestilence, and
destruction, <64 to the <222 of this <143

10:7 <46 I give unto you power, that whatsoever ye <32 seal on
<33 <5 be sealed in heaven; and <13 ye <8 loose on <12
<5 be loosed in <13 and thus <7 ye have <66 <347 this
<46

10:8 And thus, if ye <16 say unto this temple it <6 be rent in
twain, it <7 be done.

10:9 And if ye <10 say unto this mountain, Be thou cast down and
become smooth, it <14 be <24

10:10 And <204 if ye <11 say that God <4 <125 this <130 it
<6 come to pass.

10:11 And now <23 I command you, that ye <16 go and <171 unto
this <26 that thus saith the Lord God, who is the Almighty: Except
ye repent ye <23 be smitten, even unto destruction.

10:12 And <40 now it came to pass that when the Lord had spoken
these words unto <225 he did stop and did not go unto his own <449
but did return unto the multitudes who were scattered about upon the
face of the land, and began to <80 unto them the word of the Lord
<280 had been <50 unto him, concerning <436 destruction if they
did not repent.

10:13 Now <78 notwithstanding that great miracle <25 Nephi had
done in telling them <27 the death of the chief judge, they did
harden <37 hearts and did not hearken unto the <96 of the Lord.

10:14 Therefore <35 did <72 unto them the word of the Lord,
<474 <147 ye repent, thus <159 the <9 ye <150 be smitten even
unto <151

10:15 And it came to pass that when <38 had <477 unto them the
<393 <87 they did still <68 <68 <68 and would not <68
unto his words; therefore they did revile against him, and did seek to
lay <22 hands upon him that they might cast him into prison.

10:16 But <43 the <331 of God was with him, and they could not
take him to cast him into prison, for he was taken by the Spirit and
conveyed away out of the midst of them.

10:17 And it came to pass that thus he did go forth in the Spirit, from
multitude to multitude, declaring the word of God, even until he had
<119 it unto them all, or sent it <27 <407 all the <407

10:18 And it came to pass that they <129 not <129 unto his <128
and there <264 to be contentions, insomuch that they were divided
<137 themselves and <13 to slay one another with the sword.

10:19 And thus ended the seventy and first year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi.

Helaman Chapter 11

11:1 And now it came to pass in the <34 and second year of the
<35 of the <34 that the contentions did increase, <75 that
<83 were wars throughout all the land <113 all the <50 of <50

11:2 And it was this secret band of robbers who did carry on this work
of <360 and wickedness. And this war did last all that year; and
in the <67 and third year it did also last.

11:3 And it came to pass that in this year <305 did cry unto the <330
<339

11:4 O <8 do not suffer that this <78 <343 be destroyed by the
sword; but O <16 rather let <101 be a famine in the <455 to stir
them up in remembrance of the Lord <319 God, and perhaps they will
repent and turn unto thee.

11:5 And so it was done, according to the <425 of <132 And <45 was
a <462 <47 upon the <47 <148 all the <70 of <16 And thus
in the <118 and fourth year the <20 did continue, and the work of
<146 did cease by the sword but became sore by famine.

11:6 And this work of <19 did also continue in the <38 and
fifth year. For the earth was <465 that it was dry, and did not
yield <330 grain in the season of grain; and the whole <22 was
smitten, even <83 the Lamanites as well as <6 the Nephites, so
that they were <39 that they did perish by thousands in the more
wicked parts of the land.

11:7 And it came to pass that the <121 saw that they were about to
<31 by famine, and they <361 to remember the Lord <179 God; and
they <10 to <10 the <164 of <148

11:8 And the <36 <14 to plead with <23 chief <331 and <4
leaders, that they <420 say unto Nephi: Behold, we know that thou art
a man of God, and therefore cry unto the Lord our God that he turn away
from us this <71 lest all the <58 which thou hast spoken
concerning our <174 be fulfilled.

11:9 And it came to pass that the <64 did say unto Nephi, <252
to the <31 <31 had been desired. And it came to pass that when
<339 saw that the <97 had repented and did humble <489 in
sackcloth, he cried again unto the <329 <352

11:10 O <7 behold this <25 repenteth; and they have swept away
the band of Gadianton from amongst them <455 that they have become
extinct, and they have concealed <139 <443 plans in the earth.

11:11 Now, O <41 because of this <16 humility wilt thou turn away
thine anger, and let <4 anger be appeased in the <124 of
those <237 men whom thou hast already destroyed.

11:12 O <37 wilt thou turn away <27 <31 yea, thy fierce <4
and cause that this <357 may <349 in this <266

11:13 O <27 wilt thou hearken unto me, and <21 that it may be done
<162 to my words, and send <336 rain upon the face of the earth,
that she may bring <13 her fruit, and her <353 in the <353 of
grain.

11:14 O <50 thou didst <50 unto my <200 when I said, Let <454
be a <244 that the pestilence of the <426 might cease; and I know
that thou wilt, even at this time, <32 unto my <71 for thou
saidst that: If this <198 <511 I will spare them.

11:15 Yea, O <58 and thou seest that they have repented, <179 of
the <131 and the <55 and <168 <269 has come unto <29

11:16 And now, O <30 wilt thou turn away <165 <161 and try <262
if they will serve thee? And if so, O <20 thou canst bless them
<150 to thy <111 <42 thou hast said.

11:17 And it came to pass that in the seventy and sixth year the Lord
did turn away his <243 from the people, and caused that rain should
fall upon the <181 <296 that it did <181 <181 her fruit in the
<179 of her fruit. And it came to pass that it did <19 <19 her
<198 in the <19 of her <198

11:18 And behold, the <154 did rejoice and glorify God, and the whole
face of the land was filled with rejoicing; and they did no more seek
to destroy <426 but they did esteem him as a great prophet, and a man
of God, having <9 power and authority given unto him from God.

11:19 And <60 Lehi, his brother, was not a whit behind him as to
things pertaining to righteousness.

11:20 And thus it did come to pass that the <88 of <471 began to
prosper <198 in the land, and <9 to build up <414 waste places,
and <9 to multiply and spread, even until they did cover the <112
face of the <27 both on the northward and on the southward, from the
sea west to the sea east.

11:21 And it came to pass that the <220 and <220 year did end in
peace. And the <11 and seventh year <60 in peace; and the church
did spread throughout the face of all the land; and the more part of
the <244 both the Nephites and the Lamanites, did belong to the
church; and they did have exceedingly <166 peace in the <30 and thus
ended the <55 and <55 year.

11:22 And also they had <21 in the <15 and eighth year, save it
were a few contentions concerning the points of doctrine <333 had been
laid down by the prophets.

11:23 And in the <32 and ninth year <460 <103 to be much strife.
But it came to pass that <194 and <227 and many of <186 brethren who
knew <49 the true <50 of doctrine, <258 many revelations
daily, therefore they did preach unto the <120 <354 that they
did put an end to <32 strife in that same <104

11:24 And it came to pass that in the eightieth year of the reign of
the judges over the <263 of <326 <83 were a certain number of the
dissenters from the <14 of <14 who had some years before gone
over unto the <180 and taken upon themselves the name of
<9 and also a <34 <34 who were real descendants of the
<13 being stirred up to <460 by them, or by those dissenters,
<107 they commenced a war with <97 brethren.

11:25 And they did commit murder and plunder; and then they would
retreat back into the mountains, and into the wilderness and secret
<343 hiding <69 that they could not be discovered, receiving
daily an addition to <45 numbers, inasmuch as <114 were <108
that went <491 unto them.

11:26 And thus in time, yea, even in the space of not many years, they
became an <289 <289 band of robbers; and they did search out
all the <64 plans of Gadianton; and thus they <22 robbers of
Gadianton.

11:27 Now <470 these <11 did make <34 havoc, yea, even <4
destruction among the <177 of <177 and also <7 the <7 of the
Lamanites.

11:28 And it came to pass that it was expedient that <100 should be a
stop put to this work of destruction; <167 they sent an army of
strong men into the <146 and upon the mountains to <91 out
this band of robbers, and to destroy <131

11:29 But <85 it came to pass that in that same year they were
driven back even into <166 own lands. And thus <417 the <297
year of the <298 of the <297 over the <99 of Nephi.

11:30 And it came to pass in the commencement of the eighty and first
year they did go <199 again against this band of <76 and did
<77 many; and they were also visited with much destruction.

11:31 And they were <26 obliged to return out of the <116 and
out of the <118 unto <85 own lands, because of the exceeding
greatness of the numbers of <318 <199 who infested the <20
and the wilderness.

11:32 And it came to pass that thus <114 this <424 And the <25
did still increase and wax strong, <449 that they did defy the
whole armies of the Nephites, and also of the Lamanites; and they did
cause <247 fear to come unto the <142 upon all the face of the land.

11:33 Yea, for they did visit many parts of the land, and did do <31
<278 unto them; yea, did kill many, and did carry away others
captive into the wilderness, yea, and more especially <123 women and
<4 children.

11:34 Now this <35 evil, which came unto the <66 <139 of <17
iniquity, did stir them up <166 in remembrance of the Lord <13 God.

11:35 And thus <131 the <217 and <217 year of the <246 of the
judges.

11:36 And in the <18 and second year they began <40 to forget the
Lord <40 God. And in the <17 and third year they <17 to wax
<339 in iniquity. And in the <15 and fourth year they did not mend
<29 ways.

11:37 And it came to pass in the <22 and fifth year they did wax
stronger and <2 in <25 pride, and in <4 wickedness; and thus
they were ripening <72 for <288

11:38 And thus <107 the <35 and <35 <241

Helaman Chapter 12

12:1 And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the
hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his
<183 infinite goodness doth bless and prosper <312 who put <73
trust in him.

12:2 Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth <25 his
people, yea, in the <313 of <30 fields, <2 flocks and <3
herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious things
of every kind and art; sparing <23 lives, and delivering them out of
the hands of <11 enemies; softening the <99 of <6 enemies that
they should not declare wars <452 <309 yea, and in fine, doing all
<43 for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the
time that they do harden <37 hearts, and do <251 the Lord <7
God, and do trample under <7 feet the Holy One—yea, and this <319
of <10 ease, and <3 exceedingly <151 prosperity.

12:3 And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his <345 with
many afflictions, yea, <12 he doth <404 them with death and with
terror, and with famine and with all <134 of pestilence, they will
not remember him.

12:4 O how foolish, and how vain, and how <394 and devilish, and how
quick to do <393 and how slow to do good, are the <243 of men;
yea, how <18 to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set
<101 <168 upon the vain <152 of the world!

12:5 Yea, how <29 to be lifted up in pride; yea, how <9 to boast,
and do all <90 of that <465 is iniquity; and how slow are they to
<96 the Lord <47 God, and to give ear unto his counsels, yea,
how slow to walk in wisdom’s paths!

12:6 Behold, they do not desire that the Lord <30 God, who hath
created them, <244 rule and <482 over <244 notwithstanding his
<192 <342 and his mercy towards <16 they do set at naught his
<52 and they will not that he <30 be <39 guide.

12:7 O how <31 is the nothingness of the <150 of men; yea, even
they are less than the dust of the earth.

12:8 For behold, the dust of the earth moveth hither and thither, to
the dividing asunder, at the command of our <46 and everlasting God.

12:9 Yea, <455 at his voice do the hills and the mountains tremble
and quake.

12:10 And by the power of his <21 they are broken up, and become
smooth, yea, even like unto a valley.

12:11 Yea, by the <25 of his <25 doth the whole <77 shake;

12:12 Yea, by the <16 of his voice, do the foundations rock, even to
the very center.

12:13 Yea, and if he say unto the earth—Move—it is moved.

12:14 Yea, if he say unto the earth—Thou shalt go back, that it
lengthen out the day for many hours—it is done;

12:15 And thus, according to his word the <74 goeth <26 and it
appeareth unto man that the sun standeth still; yea, and <172 this
is so; for surely it is the <26 that <178 and not the sun.

12:16 And <22 also, if he say unto the waters of the <184 deep—Be
thou dried up—it is done.

12:17 <297 if he say unto this mountain—Be thou raised up, and come
over and fall upon that city, that it be buried up—behold it is <31

12:18 And <54 if a man hide up a treasure in the earth, and the
Lord shall say—Let it be accursed, because of the iniquity of him who
hath hid it up—behold, it <18 be accursed.

12:19 And if the Lord <11 say—Be thou <28 that no man <7
find thee from this time henceforth and forever—behold, no man getteth
it <8 and forever.

12:20 And <74 if the Lord <27 say unto a man—Because of thine
iniquities, thou <206 be accursed forever—it <14 be <100

12:21 And if the Lord <11 say—Because of <22 iniquities thou <21
be cut off from my presence—he will cause that it <18 be so.

12:22 And wo unto him to whom he <14 say this, for it <5 be unto
him that will do iniquity, and he cannot be saved; therefore, for this
cause, that men might be saved, hath repentance been declared.

12:23 Therefore, blessed are they who will repent and hearken unto the
<354 of the Lord <470 God; for these are they that <55 be saved.

12:24 And may God grant, in his <252 fulness, that men <51 be
brought unto <52 and good works, that they <11 be restored
unto grace for grace, <328 to <45 works.

12:25 And I would that all men <22 be <50 But we read that in the
<47 and last day there are some who <68 be cast out, yea, who <6
be cast off from the presence of the Lord;

12:26 Yea, who <17 be consigned to a state of endless misery,
fulfilling the words which say: They that have done good <20 have
everlasting life; and they that have done evil <11 have <10
damnation. And thus it is. Amen.

Helaman Chapter 13

13:1 And now it came to pass in the eighty and sixth year, the Nephites
did still remain in wickedness, yea in <104 <4 while the
Lamanites did observe strictly to keep the commandments of God,
<144 to the law of Moses.

13:2 And it came to pass that in this year <135 was one Samuel, a
Lamanite, came into the land of Zarahemla, and began to preach unto the
people. And it came to pass that he did preach, many days, <209
unto the people, and they did cast him out, and he was about to return
to his own land.

13:3 But <379 the <271 of the Lord came unto him, that he should
<24 again, and prophesy unto the people whatsoever things <11
come into his heart.

13:4 And it came to pass that they <251 not suffer that he <22
enter into the city; therefore he went and got upon the wall thereof,
and stretched forth his hand and cried with a loud voice, and
prophesied unto the <57 <57 <57 the Lord put into his
<58

13:5 And he said unto them: Behold, I, <153 a <152 do speak the
<259 of the Lord <262 he doth put into my heart; and behold he hath
put it into my heart to say unto this <53 that the sword of justice
hangeth over this people; and four hundred years pass not away save the
<18 of <18 falleth upon this <195

13:6 Yea, heavy destruction awaiteth this <189 and it surely cometh
unto this <8 and nothing can save this <51 save it be
<212 and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ, who <25 <331 come
into the world, and <7 <162 many <127 and <5 be slain for his
<57

13:7 And <219 an angel of the Lord hath declared it unto me, and he
did bring glad tidings to my soul. And <22 I was sent unto you to
declare it unto you also, that ye <464 have glad tidings; but <145
ye <225 not receive me.

13:8 Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Because of the hardness of the
hearts of the <107 of the Nephites, except they repent I will take
away my word from them, and I will withdraw my Spirit from <8 and I
will <112 them no longer, and I will turn the <40 of their
brethren against them.

13:9 And four <195 <195 <132 not pass away before I will cause
that they <11 be smitten; yea, I will visit them with the <210 and
with famine and with pestilence.

13:10 Yea, I will <19 them in my fierce anger, and <441 <33 be
those of the fourth generation who <9 live, of your enemies, to
<138 your utter destruction; and this <13 <212 come <117 ye
repent, <138 the Lord; and <30 of the <30 <30 <16 <47
your destruction.

13:11 But if ye will <141 and <423 unto the Lord your God I will
turn away mine <68 <37 the <37 yea, thus <5 the Lord, blessed
are they who will <29 and turn unto me, but wo unto him that
repenteth not.

13:12 Yea, wo unto this great city of Zarahemla; for <248 it is
because of <79 who are righteous that it is saved; yea, wo unto this
<24 city, for I perceive, <59 the <59 that <135 are many, yea,
even the more part of this <20 <20 that will harden <207 <210
<207 me, <25 the Lord.

13:13 But <89 are they who will <140 for them will I spare. But
<70 if it were not for the <68 who are in this <43 <43
<15 I <312 <231 that fire should come down out of heaven and
destroy it.

13:14 But <21 it is for the righteous’ sake that it is spared. But
<13 the time cometh, <74 the <99 that when ye <197 cast out
the <57 from among you, then <10 ye be ripe for <231
yea, wo be unto this <69 <69 <149 of the wickedness and
abominations which are in her.

13:15 Yea, and wo be unto the city of Gideon, for the <23 and
<23 <23 are in her.

13:16 Yea, and wo be unto all the cities <16 are in the land round
about, <8 are possessed by the <411 <60 of the <37
and <37 <13 are in <382

13:17 And <110 a curse <93 come upon the land, <114 the Lord of
Hosts, <30 of the people’s sake who are upon the <16 yea, <11
of <213 <42 and <3 abominations.

13:18 And it <36 come to pass, <35 the Lord of <34 yea, our
<129 and true God, that whoso <18 hide up treasures in the earth
<8 find them again no more, <46 of the <23 <73 of the <55
save he be a <179 man and <22 hide it up unto the <271

13:19 For I will, <58 the <207 that they <19 hide up <78
<51 unto me; and cursed be they who hide not up <13 <12
unto me; for none hideth up <9 <9 unto me save it be the
righteous; and he that <15 not up his <16 unto me, <36 is
he, and also the treasure, and none <55 redeem it <93 of the
<93 of the land.

13:20 And the day <18 come that they <4 hide up <55 treasures,
<25 they have set <7 <378 upon riches; and <9 they have
set <10 <10 upon <3 riches, and will hide up <6 <65
when they <34 flee before <8 enemies; <24 they will not hide
them up unto me, <81 be they and also <17 treasures; and in that
day <27 they be smitten, <147 the <157

13:21 Behold ye, the people of this <187 <339 and hearken unto my
words; yea, <6 unto the words <283 the Lord saith; for <279 he
<34 that ye are <54 <65 of your <83 and also are your
riches <11 <11 ye have set your <99 upon them, and have not
hearkened unto the <40 of him who gave them unto you.

13:22 Ye do not remember the Lord your God in the things with <63 he
hath blessed you, but ye do always <19 your <59 not to thank
the Lord your God for them; yea, your <59 are not drawn out unto the
<267 but they do swell with <115 pride, unto boasting, and unto <6
swelling, envyings, strifes, malice, persecutions and murders, and all
manner of iniquities.

13:23 For this cause hath the Lord God caused that a <243 should come
upon the <339 and also upon your <73 and this <127 of your
<33

13:24 Yea, wo unto this people, <14 of this time <106 has arrived,
that ye do cast out the prophets, and do mock <152 and cast stones at
<6 and do slay <4 and do all <77 of iniquity unto <8 even
as they did of old time.

13:25 And now when ye talk, ye say: If our days had been in the days of
our fathers of old, we would not have slain the prophets; we <7 not
have stoned <47 and cast them out.

13:26 <276 ye are worse than they; for as the Lord liveth, if a
prophet come among you and declareth unto you the word of the <187
<116 testifieth of your sins and iniquities, ye are angry with him,
and cast him out and seek all <108 of ways to destroy him; yea, you
will say that he is a false prophet, and that he is a sinner, and of
the devil, <168 he <49 that your deeds are evil.

13:27 But <341 if a man <380 come <79 you and <5 say: Do this,
and there is no iniquity; do that and ye <14 not suffer; yea, he will
say: Walk after the pride of your own hearts; yea, walk <9 the <9
of your eyes, and do whatsoever your heart desireth—and if a man <34
come <54 you and say <52 ye will receive him, and say that he is a
prophet.

13:28 Yea, ye will lift him up, and ye will give unto him of your
substance; ye will give unto him of your gold, and of your silver, and
ye will clothe him with costly apparel; and <132 he speaketh
flattering <431 unto you, and he <467 that all is well, then ye will
not find fault with him.

13:29 O ye wicked and ye perverse generation; ye hardened and ye
stiffnecked <342 how long will ye suppose that the Lord will suffer
you? Yea, how long will ye <8 yourselves to be led by foolish and
blind guides? Yea, how long will ye choose darkness rather than light?

13:30 Yea, <204 the anger of the Lord is already kindled against
you; <12 he hath cursed the land <103 of your iniquity.

13:31 And <15 the time cometh that he curseth your <437 that
they become slippery, that ye cannot hold <510 and in the days of your
poverty ye <12 retain them.

13:32 And in the days of your <15 ye <217 cry unto the Lord; and
in vain <9 ye cry, for your desolation is <79 come upon you, and
your destruction is made sure; and then <20 ye weep and howl in that
day, <183 the Lord of Hosts. And then <16 ye lament, and say:

13:33 O that I had repented, and had not killed the <505 and
<440 <440 and cast them out. Yea, in that day ye <33 say: O that
we had remembered the Lord our God in the day that he gave us our
<134 and then they <480 not have <137 slippery that we should
lose <138 for <158 our riches are gone from us.

13:34 Behold, we lay a tool here and on the morrow it is gone; and
<26 our swords are taken from us in the day we have sought them for
battle.

13:35 Yea, we have hid up our treasures and they have slipped away from
us, <229 of the curse of the land.

13:36 O that we had repented in the day that the word of the Lord came
unto us; for behold the land is cursed, and all things are <110
<248 and we <236 hold <236

13:37 <102 we are surrounded by demons, yea, we are encircled about
by the angels of him who hath <94 to destroy our souls. <24 our
iniquities are great. O Lord, canst thou not turn away thine <334 from
us? And this <194 be your language in those days.

13:38 But <143 your days of probation are past; ye have
procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too
late, and your <286 is made <286 yea, for ye have <70 all
the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have
<19 for happiness in doing iniquity, <15 thing is contrary to the
nature of that righteousness <11 is in our great and Eternal Head.

13:39 O ye people of the land, that ye <270 hear my words! And I pray
that the <117 of the Lord be turned away from you, and that ye <22
repent and be saved.

Helaman Chapter 14

14:1 And now it came to pass that Samuel, the Lamanite, did prophesy a
<68 many more <214 <76 <209 be written.

14:2 And <154 he said unto them: <191 I give unto you a sign; for
five years more cometh, and <19 then <499 the Son of God to
redeem all <191 who <198 believe on his name.

14:3 And <23 this will I give unto you for a sign at the time of
his coming; for <18 there <30 be <77 lights in heaven, insomuch
that in the night before he <55 <16 <16 be no darkness, <14
that it <8 appear unto man as if it was day.

14:4 Therefore, <23 <15 be one day and a <34 and a day, as if it
were one day and <19 were no night; and this <24 be unto you for a
<121 for ye <10 know of the rising of the sun and also of its
setting; therefore they <16 know of a surety that <38 <7 be two
days and a <43 nevertheless the <61 <11 not be darkened; and it
<7 be the <11 <106 he is born.

14:5 And <129 <33 <15 a new star arise, such an one as ye never
have beheld; and this also <17 be a sign unto you.

14:6 And <450 this is not all, <34 <17 be many signs and wonders
in heaven.

14:7 And it <15 come to pass that ye <6 all be amazed, and wonder,
<171 that ye <10 fall to the earth.

14:8 And it <11 come to pass that whosoever <6 <241 on the Son
of God, the same <10 have everlasting life.

14:9 And <103 thus hath the Lord commanded me, by his angel, that I
should come and tell this <405 unto you; yea, he hath <19 that I
<15 <337 these <333 unto you; yea, he hath said unto me: Cry
unto this people, <378 and prepare the way of the Lord.

14:10 And now, because I am a <373 and have spoken unto you the
words <373 the Lord hath <52 me, and <20 it was hard against
you, ye are angry with me and do seek to destroy me, and have cast me
out from among you.

14:11 And ye <121 hear my words, for, for this intent have I come up
upon the walls of this city, that ye might hear and know of the
judgments of God <71 do await you <68 of your iniquities, and
also that ye <23 know the conditions of repentance;

14:12 And also that ye <14 know of the coming of Jesus Christ, the
Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, the Creator of all
<164 from the beginning; and that ye <32 know of the <270 of his
coming, to the <94 that ye <14 <235 on his <476

14:13 And if ye <11 on his name ye will <189 of all your sins,
that thereby ye may have a remission of them through his merits.

14:14 And <257 again, another sign I give unto you, yea, a sign of
his death.

14:15 For <20 he surely must die that salvation may come; yea, it
behooveth him and becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring to pass
the resurrection of the dead, that <67 men may be brought into the
presence of the <267

14:16 Yea, <48 this death bringeth to pass the resurrection, and
redeemeth all mankind from the first death—that spiritual death; for
all mankind, by the fall of Adam being cut off from the <42 of the
Lord, are considered as <60 both as to <175 temporal and to <4
spiritual.

14:17 But <57 the <81 of Christ <52 <41 yea,
even all <5 and <67 them back into the <42 of the <84

14:18 Yea, and it <16 to pass the condition of repentance, that
<440 repenteth the same is not hewn down and cast into the fire;
but <15 <15 not is hewn down and cast into the <13 and
there cometh upon them again a <112 death, yea, a second <4
for they are cut off <14 as to <95 pertaining to righteousness.

14:19 Therefore <244 ye, <2 ye, lest by knowing <455 <17 and
not doing them ye <381 suffer yourselves to come under condemnation,
and ye are <192 down unto this <50 <238

14:20 But <133 as I said unto you concerning <263 sign, a sign of
his <70 <15 in that day that he <43 <43 <211 the sun <5
be darkened and refuse to give his light unto you; and also the moon
and the stars; and <114 <22 be no <16 upon the face of this land,
even from the time that he <17 <44 <53 for the space of three
days, to the time that he <15 rise <131 from the dead.

14:21 Yea, at the time that he <16 yield up the ghost <54 <6 be
thunderings and lightnings for the <40 of many hours, and the earth
<16 shake and tremble; and the rocks <497 are upon the face of this
<459 <9 are both above the <23 and beneath, <8 ye know at
this time are solid, or the more part of it is one solid mass, <43 be
broken up;

14:22 Yea, they <11 be rent in twain, and <6 ever after be found
in seams and in cracks, and in <27 fragments upon the face of the
whole <67 yea, both <66 the <66 and beneath.

14:23 And <198 <113 <37 be great tempests, and <6 <6 be
many mountains laid low, like unto a valley, and <13 <13 be many
places <97 are now called valleys <5 <11 become mountains, whose
height is great.

14:24 And many highways <15 be <71 up, and many cities <7
<23 desolate.

14:25 And many graves <11 be opened, and <4 <186 up many of their
dead; and many saints <11 appear unto many.

14:26 And <89 thus hath the angel spoken unto me; for he said unto
me that <84 should be <215 and <215 for the <215 of
many hours.

14:27 And he said unto me that while the thunder and the lightning
lasted, and the tempest, that <382 <382 <36 be, and that darkness
<6 cover the face of the <167 <162 for the <45 of <300 days.

14:28 And the <74 said unto me that many <93 see greater <36
than these, to the intent that they might believe that <49 signs and
<4 wonders <47 come to pass upon all the face of this <360 to
the <26 that <106 <17 be no cause for unbelief among the
children of men—

14:29 And this to the <23 that whosoever will <49 <51 be
saved, and that <9 will not believe, a righteous judgment <13
come upon them; and also if they are condemned they bring upon
themselves <191 own condemnation.

14:30 And now remember, <1 my brethren, that <37
perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and <7 doeth iniquity, <2
it unto <9 for <206 ye are free; ye are permitted to act for
yourselves; for <13 God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath
made you free.

14:31 He hath <18 unto you that ye <85 know good from evil, and he
hath <14 unto you that ye <14 choose life or death; and ye can do
good and be restored unto that <333 is good, or have that <6 is
good <13 unto you; or ye can do <43 and have that <15 is evil
<15 unto you.

Helaman Chapter 15

15:1 And now, my beloved <129 <99 I declare unto you that
except ye <243 repent your houses <4 be left unto you <368

15:2 Yea, <17 ye repent, your women <16 have <434 <225 to mourn
in the day that they <12 give suck; for ye <5 attempt to flee and
<249 <7 be no place for refuge; yea, and wo unto them <86 are
with child, for they <18 be heavy and cannot flee; therefore, they
<9 be trodden down and <5 be left to perish.

15:3 Yea, wo unto this people who are <479 the <5 of Nephi <82
they <24 <84 when they <4 see all <331 <335 and <333
<57 <9 be showed unto <280 for <128 they have been a chosen
<32 of the Lord; yea, the <6 of <38 hath he loved, and also
hath he chastened <27 yea, in the days of <301 iniquities hath he
<12 them because he loveth them.

15:4 But behold my <178 the Lamanites hath he hated <17 <25
deeds have been evil continually, and this <10 of the iniquity of
the tradition of <18 fathers. But <77 salvation hath come unto
them through the preaching of the Nephites; and for this <397 hath
the Lord prolonged <25 <475

15:5 And I would that ye <434 <64 that the more part of them are
in the path of <25 duty, and they do walk circumspectly before God,
and they do observe to keep his commandments and his statutes and his
judgments according to the law of Moses.

15:6 Yea, I say unto you, that the more part of them are doing this,
and they are striving with unwearied diligence that they may <458 the
remainder of <65 brethren to the <413 of the truth; therefore
<275 are many who do add to <17 numbers daily.

15:7 And <137 ye do know of yourselves, for ye have witnessed it,
that as many of them as are brought to the <43 of the truth, and
to know of the wicked and abominable traditions of <45 fathers, and
are led to believe the holy scriptures, yea, the prophecies of the holy
prophets, <277 are written, <3 leadeth them to faith on the Lord,
and unto repentance, <12 <9 and repentance bringeth a change of
heart unto them—

15:8 Therefore, as many as have come to <136 ye know of yourselves are
firm and steadfast in the faith, and in the thing wherewith they have
been made free.

15:9 And ye know also that they have buried <93 weapons of war, and
they fear to take them up lest by any means they <251 sin; yea, ye
can see that they fear to sin—for <262 they will suffer themselves
that they be <428 down and slain by <43 enemies, and will not lift
<7 swords against them, and this <335 of <8 <117 in Christ.

15:10 And now, <12 of <12 steadfastness when they do <161 in
that <99 <139 they do believe, for <17 of <17 firmness when
they are once enlightened, <225 the Lord <448 bless them and
prolong <17 days, notwithstanding <3 iniquity—

15:11 Yea, even if they <100 dwindle in unbelief the Lord <25
<22 <19 <22 until the time <8 come <53 hath been spoken of
by our <233 and also by the prophet Zenos, and many other <226
concerning the restoration of our <453 the Lamanites, again to the
<273 of the truth—

15:12 Yea, I say unto you, that in the latter times the promises of the
Lord have been extended to our <36 the Lamanites; and
<93 the many afflictions <70 they <74 have, and
<10 they <6 be driven to and fro upon the face of the
earth, and be hunted, and <17 be smitten and scattered abroad, having
no place for refuge, the Lord <14 be merciful unto them.

15:13 And this is <449 to the prophecy, that they <18 <100 be
<375 to the true knowledge, <66 is <106 of <147 Redeemer,
and <4 great and true shepherd, and be numbered among his sheep.

15:14 Therefore I say unto you, it <38 be better for them than for
you except ye repent.

15:15 For <220 had the mighty works been shown unto them <55 have
been <7 unto you, yea, unto them who have dwindled in <218
<255 of the <438 of <68 <205 ye can see of <383
that they never would <96 have <23 in unbelief.

15:16 <409 saith the Lord: I will not utterly destroy <322 but I
will cause that in the day of my wisdom they <91 return <34 unto
me, <28 the Lord.

15:17 And now <89 <10 the <471 <255 the people of the
Nephites: If they will not repent, and observe to do my will, I will
<56 <56 <56 <27 the <27 <95 of <92 <100
<231 the many <125 <125 <121 I have done <164 them; and
as surely as the Lord liveth <70 these things be, <31 the <68

Helaman Chapter 16

16:1 And now, it came to pass that there were many who heard the words
of Samuel, the Lamanite, <50 he spake upon the walls of the city. And
as many as believed on his word went forth and sought for Nephi; and
when they had come <11 and found him they confessed unto him <96
sins and denied not, desiring that they might be baptized unto the
<83

16:2 But as many as <74 were who did not <487 in the <76 of
Samuel were angry with him; and they cast stones at him upon the wall,
and also many shot arrows at him as he stood upon the wall; but the
Spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch that they could not hit him
with <82 <40 neither with <4 arrows.

16:3 Now when they saw that they <22 not hit him, <78 were many
more who did <80 on his words, <40 that they went away unto
Nephi to be baptized.

16:4 For <258 <10 was baptizing, and prophesying, and preaching,
crying repentance unto the people, showing signs and wonders, working
miracles <234 the <10 that they <146 know that the Christ must
shortly come—

16:5 Telling them of <243 <210 must <12 come, that they <23
know and remember at the time of <101 coming that they had been made
known unto them beforehand, to the intent that they <26 believe;
therefore as many as <235 on the <182 of <181 went <226 unto
him to be baptized, for they came repenting and confessing <44 sins.

16:6 But the more part of them did not <136 in the <34 of Samuel;
<45 when they saw that they <160 not hit him with <32 <181
and <4 arrows, they cried unto <5 captains, saying: Take this
fellow and bind him, for behold he hath a devil; and <387 of the
power of the devil <125 is in him we cannot hit him with our <43
and our arrows; <60 take him and bind him, and away with him.

16:7 And as they went <112 to lay <61 hands on him, <208 he did
cast himself down from the <298 and did flee out of <19 lands, yea,
even unto his own country, and began to preach and to prophesy <218
his own people.

16:8 And <41 he was never <428 of more <17 the Nephites; and
thus were the affairs of the <24

16:9 And thus ended the eighty and sixth year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi.

16:10 And thus <24 also the <25 and seventh year of the <25 of
the judges, the more part of the <28 remaining in <97 pride and
wickedness, and the lesser part walking more circumspectly before God.

16:11 And these were the conditions also, in the <45 and eighth year
of the <46 of the judges.

16:12 And <389 was but little alteration in the <105 of the <349
save it were the <61 <146 to be more hardened in iniquity, and do
more and more of that <226 was contrary to the commandments of God, in
the <59 and ninth year of the <58 of the <58

16:13 But it came to pass in the ninetieth year of the <19 of the
<123 <73 were great <423 given unto the <70 and wonders; and
the <329 of the prophets <73 to be fulfilled.

16:14 And angels did appear unto men, wise men, and did declare unto
them glad tidings of <40 joy; thus in this year the scriptures <33
to be <34

16:15 Nevertheless, the <118 <12 to harden <180 hearts, all save
it were the most believing part of them, both of the Nephites and also
of the Lamanites, and <27 to depend upon <28 own strength and upon
<6 own wisdom, <392

16:16 Some <501 they may have guessed right, <293 so many; but
<305 we know that all <220 <83 and marvelous works <391 come to
pass, of <176 has been spoken.

16:17 And they <56 to reason and to contend <37 themselves, <51

16:18 That it is not reasonable that such a being as a Christ shall
come; if so, and he be the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of
earth, as it has been spoken, why will he not show <422 unto us as
well as unto them who <40 be at Jerusalem?

16:19 Yea, why will he not show <24 in this land as well as in the
land of <23

16:20 But <123 we know that this is a wicked tradition, <116 has
been handed down unto us by our fathers, to cause us that we should
believe in some <147 and <147 thing <25 <10 come to <147
but not <133 us, but in a land <14 is far distant, a land <6 we
know not; therefore they can keep us in ignorance, for we <181
witness with our own eyes that they are true.

16:21 And they will, by the cunning and the mysterious arts of the evil
one, work some <70 mystery <48 we <36 understand, <4 will
keep us down to be servants to <259 words, and also <6 unto
<288 for we <277 upon them to teach us the word; and thus will they
keep us in ignorance if we will yield ourselves unto <26 all the days
of our lives.

16:22 And many more <298 did the <348 imagine up in <55 <348
<68 were foolish and vain; and they were much disturbed, for Satan
did stir them up to do iniquity continually; yea, he did go about
spreading rumors and contentions upon all the face of the land, that he
might <394 the hearts of the <54 against that <50 was good and
<7 that <7 <197 come.

16:23 And notwithstanding the <480 and the wonders <14 were wrought
<207 the <30 of the Lord, and the many miracles <14 they did,
<78 did get <166 hold upon the <52 of the <22 upon all the
face of the land.

16:24 And thus ended the ninetieth year of the reign of the judges over
the <28 of Nephi.

16:25 And thus <22 the book of Helaman, according to the record of
Helaman and his sons.




 THIRD BOOK OF NEPHI

THE SON OF NEPHI, WHO WAS THE SON OF HELAMAN

And <35 was the son of <47 who was the son of Alma, who was
the son of <7 <451 a descendant of Nephi who was the son of Lehi,
who came out of Jerusalem in the first year of the <104 of Zedekiah,
the king of Judah.

3 <31 Chapter 1

1:1 Now it came to pass that the ninety and <32 year had passed away
and it was six hundred years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem;
and it was in the year that Lachoneus was the chief judge and the
governor over the <183

1:2 And Nephi, the son of <113 had departed out of the land of
Zarahemla, giving charge unto his son <19 who was his eldest son,
concerning the plates of brass, and all the records <246 had been
kept, and all those <349 <9 had been kept sacred from the
departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem.

1:3 Then he <58 out of the <327 and whither he went, no man
knoweth; and his son <140 did keep the <50 in his stead, yea, the
<243 of this people.

1:4 And it came to pass that in the commencement of the <156 and
second year, behold, the prophecies of the prophets began to be
fulfilled more fully; for there <9 to be greater <363 and <3
<350 <362 <361 the <48

1:5 But <19 were some who <22 to say that the time was past for the
words to be fulfilled, <123 were spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite.

1:6 And they <28 to rejoice over <483 brethren, saying: Behold the
time is past, and the <32 of Samuel are not fulfilled; therefore,
your joy and your faith <182 this thing hath been vain.

1:7 And it came to pass that they did make a <432 uproar throughout
the land; and the <405 who believed <59 to be very sorrowful, lest
by any means <207 <207 <84 had been <85 <510 not come to pass.

1:8 But <150 they did watch steadfastly for that day and that night
and that day <29 should be as one day as if <140 were no night, that
they <40 know that <114 <92 had not been <90

1:9 Now it came to pass that <26 was a day set apart by the
unbelievers, that all <77 who <90 in <4 traditions <51 be
put to death except the sign <9 come to pass, <65 had been given
by <154 the prophet.

1:10 Now it came to pass that when <346 the son of <4 saw this
wickedness of his people, his heart was exceedingly sorrowful.

1:11 And it came to pass that he went out and bowed himself down upon
the earth, and cried mightily to his God in behalf of his <37 yea,
<86 who were about to be destroyed because of <127 <127 in the
tradition of <7 fathers.

1:12 And it came to pass that he <41 <41 unto the Lord, all that
day; and <190 the voice of the Lord came unto him, <278

1:13 Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for <24 the time is at
hand, and on this <214 shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come
I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfill all that
<172 I have caused to be <269 by the mouth of my holy prophets.

1:14 Behold, I come unto my own, to <29 all <294 <28 I have
made known unto the children of men from the foundation of the <57
and to do the will, both of the Father and of the Son—of the <6
<156 of me, and of the Son <7 of my flesh. And <112 the time
is at <112 and this <111 <111 the sign be given.

1:15 And it came to pass that the <422 <73 came unto Nephi were
<458 according as they had been spoken; for <41 at the going
down of the sun <327 was no darkness; and the <411 <409 to be
astonished <67 <13 was no darkness when the <60 came.

1:16 And <13 were many, who had not <345 the <58 of the
prophets, who fell to the earth and became as if they were dead, for
they knew that the <470 plan of destruction <84 they had laid for
<292 who <37 in the <38 of the prophets had been frustrated;
for the sign <22 had been <379 was already at hand.

1:17 And they <90 to know that the Son of God must shortly appear;
yea, in fine, all the <108 upon the face of the whole <78 from the
west to the east, both in the land north and in the land south, were so
<403 <132 that they fell to the earth.

1:18 For they knew that the <84 had testified of these <261 for
many years, and that the sign <90 had been <90 was <90 at hand;
and they <87 to fear <175 of <398 iniquity and <3 unbelief.

1:19 And it came to pass that <178 was no <191 in all that night,
but it was as light as though it was mid-day. And it came to pass that
the sun did rise in the morning again, <254 to its proper order;
and they knew that it was the day that the Lord should be born, <71
of the sign <90 had been <302

1:20 And it had come to pass, yea, all things, every whit, <44 to
the <214 of the <400

1:21 And it came to pass also that a new star did appear, <24 to
the word.

1:22 And it came to pass that from this time forth <121 <142 to be
lyings sent <8 among the people, by Satan, to harden <148 hearts,
to the intent that they might not believe in <285 signs and wonders
<94 they had seen; but notwithstanding <200 <34 and deceivings
the more part of the <259 did believe, and were converted unto the
Lord.

1:23 And it came to pass that <413 went <63 <63 the <63 and
also many others, baptizing unto repentance, in the <52 <85 was a
<357 remission of sins. And thus the <48 <96 again to have peace
in the land.

1:24 And <26 were no contentions, save it were a few that <24 to
preach, endeavoring to prove by the scriptures that it was no more
expedient to observe the law of Moses. Now in this thing they did err,
having not understood the scriptures.

1:25 But it came to pass that they soon <449 converted, and were
convinced of the error <94 they were in, for it was made known unto
them that the law was not yet fulfilled, and that it must be fulfilled
in <250 whit; yea, the word came unto them that it must be fulfilled;
yea, that one jot or tittle <295 not pass away till it <6 all be
<18 therefore in this same year were they brought to a knowledge
of <234 <73 and did confess <5 faults.

1:26 And thus the ninety and second year did pass away, bringing glad
tidings unto the <180 <344 of the <252 <103 did come to <334
<306 to the <329 of the prophecy of all the holy <334

1:27 And it came to pass that the <47 and third year did also pass
away in peace, save it were for the Gadianton robbers, who dwelt upon
the mountains, who did infest the land; for so strong were <89 holds
and <4 secret places that the <76 could not overpower them;
<122 they did commit many murders, and did do much slaughter <298
the people.

1:28 And it came to pass that in the <75 and fourth year they <269
to increase in <306 degree, <120 <287 were many dissenters of the
Nephites who did flee unto them, <130 did cause much sorrow unto <390
<14 who did remain in the <320

1:29 And <33 was also a <22 of much <23 <70 the Lamanites; for
behold, they had many children who did grow up and <64 to wax <116
in years, that they <294 for themselves, and were led away by some
who were Zoramites, by <130 <439 and <3 flattering words, to join
<69 <161 robbers.

1:30 And thus were the Lamanites afflicted also, and <47 to decrease
as to <27 faith and righteousness, <114 of the wickedness of the
rising generation.

3 <456 Chapter 2

2:1 And it came to pass that thus passed away the <156 and fifth year
<47 and the <197 <49 to forget <67 <274 and wonders <146 they
had heard, and <13 to be less and less astonished at a sign or a
wonder from heaven, insomuch that they <19 to be hard in <80
hearts, and blind in <6 minds, and <14 to disbelieve all <43
they had heard and seen—

2:2 Imagining up some vain <468 in <24 <29 that it was wrought
by men and by the power of the devil, to lead away and deceive the
hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get possession of the <12
of the <107 again, <79 that he did <71 <46 eyes and lead
them away to believe that the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a
vain thing.

2:3 And it came to pass that the <40 <101 to wax <243 in
<189 and abominations; and they did not <39 that <281 <482
be any more <164 or <164 given; and <76 did go about, leading
away the <79 of the people, tempting them and causing them that they
<30 do <350 <43 in the <324

2:4 And thus did pass away the <219 and sixth year; and also the
<8 and seventh <8 and also the <7 and eighth <7 and also
the <8 and ninth <8

2:5 And also an hundred years had <259 away since the days of Mosiah,
who was king over the <114 of the Nephites.

2:6 And six <26 and nine <28 had <28 away <28 Lehi left
Jerusalem.

2:7 And nine <15 had <15 away from the time when the sign was
given, <251 was spoken of by the prophets, that <183 <117 come
into the world.

2:8 Now the <453 <176 to reckon <213 time from this period when
the sign was <36 or from the coming of Christ; therefore, nine <57
had <58 away.

2:9 And Nephi, who was the father of <6 who had the charge of the
records, did not return to the land of Zarahemla, and could nowhere be
found in all the <188

2:10 And it came to pass that the <139 did still remain in
wickedness, notwithstanding the much preaching and prophesying <111
was sent among them; and thus <72 away the tenth year also; and the
eleventh year also <12 away in iniquity.

2:11 And it came to pass in the thirteenth year <287 <127 to be wars
and contentions throughout all the land; for the Gadianton robbers had
become so numerous, and did slay so many of the <293 and did lay
waste so many cities, and did spread so much death and carnage
<38 the land, that it became expedient that all the <28 both
the <187 and the Lamanites, <203 take up arms against them.

2:12 Therefore, all the Lamanites who had <62 converted unto the
Lord did unite with <212 brethren, the Nephites, and were compelled,
for the safety of <12 lives and <3 women and <3 children, to
take up arms <46 those <102 robbers, yea, and also to maintain
<17 rights, and the privileges of <6 church and of <4 worship,
and <4 freedom and <3 liberty.

2:13 And it came to pass that before this <157 year had <175
away the <102 were threatened with utter destruction because of
this war, <210 had <95 exceedingly sore.

2:14 And it came to pass that <73 <112 who had united with the
<34 were numbered <232 the Nephites;

2:15 And <66 curse was taken from them, and <7 skin <165 white
like unto the <21

2:16 And <14 young men and <4 daughters <18 <59 fair,
and they were <43 <43 the <152 and were called <434
And thus ended the <99 year.

2:17 And it came to pass in the commencement of the fourteenth year,
the war between the <262 and the <330 of Nephi did continue and
did <113 <54 sore; nevertheless, the <13 of <13 did gain
some advantage of the <186 insomuch that they did drive them back
out of <82 lands into the mountains and into <7 secret places.

2:18 And thus <78 the <62 <78 And in the fifteenth year they
did come forth <230 the <53 of Nephi; and <182 of the
wickedness of the <11 of <447 and <40 many <356 and
dissensions, the <252 <92 did gain many advantages over <306

2:19 And thus <52 the <47 <114 and thus were the <33 in a
state of many afflictions; and the sword of <235 did hang over
<195 <104 that they were about to be smitten down by it, and this
<72 of <63 <439

3 <135 Chapter 3

3:1 And now it came to pass that in the sixteenth year from the coming
of Christ, Lachoneus, the governor of the <411 received an epistle
from the leader and the <13 of this band of robbers; and these
were the words <308 were written, saying:

3:2 <35 most noble and chief <25 of the <38 behold, I
write this <41 unto you, and do give unto you <222 great
praise <93 of your firmness, and also the firmness of your <469
in maintaining that <49 ye suppose to be your right and liberty; yea,
ye do stand well, as if ye were supported by the hand of a god, in the
defence of your liberty, and your property, and your country, or that
<42 ye do call so.

3:3 And it seemeth a pity unto me, most <98 <101 that ye should
be so foolish and vain as to <70 that ye can <63 <263 so many
brave men who are at my command, who do now at this time <18 in <202
arms, and do await with <121 anxiety for the word—Go down upon the
<446 and destroy <270

3:4 And I, knowing of <28 unconquerable spirit, having proved them in
the field of battle, and <15 of <15 everlasting hatred towards
you <160 of the many wrongs <108 ye have done unto <278 therefore
if they <97 come down <86 you they would visit you with utter
destruction.

3:5 Therefore I have written this epistle, sealing it with mine own
hand, feeling for your welfare, <49 of your <205 in that <50
ye believe to be right, and your <150 spirit in the <80 of battle.

3:6 <43 I <251 unto you, desiring that ye <62 yield up unto
this my <240 your cities, your lands, and your possessions, rather
than that they <88 <82 you with the <383 and that <384
<10 come upon you.

3:7 Or in other words, <41 yourselves up unto us, and unite with us
and become acquainted with our <493 works, and <7 our brethren
that ye may be like unto us—not our slaves, but our <13 and
partners of all our substance.

3:8 And <348 I swear unto you, if ye will do this, with an oath, ye
shall not be destroyed; but if ye will not do <16 I <25 unto you
with an <21 that on the morrow month I will command that my armies
<31 come down <202 you, and they <7 not stay <233 hand and
<7 spare not, but <4 slay you, and <4 let fall the <135 upon
you even until ye <11 <108 extinct.

3:9 And <87 I am Giddianhi; and I am the <447 of this the
<131 society of Gadianton; <220 <4 and the works thereof I know
to be good; and they are of ancient date and they have been handed down
unto us.

3:10 And I <231 this <482 unto you, <398 and I hope that ye
will deliver up your lands and your <230 without the shedding
of blood, that this my people may recover <113 rights and government,
who have dissented away from you <302 of your wickedness in
retaining from them <20 <20 of <20 and except ye do <172
I will avenge <13 wrongs. I am Giddianhi.

3:11 And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this <82 he
was exceedingly astonished, <47 of the boldness of Giddianhi
demanding the possession of the land of the Nephites, and also of
threatening the <83 and avenging the <420 of those that had
<40 no wrong, save it were they had wronged themselves by
dissenting away unto <19 wicked and abominable robbers.

3:12 Now <197 this <144 the governor, was a just man, and
could not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a
robber; <469 he did not hearken to the <95 of Giddianhi, the
<226 of the robbers, but he did cause that his <82 <390 cry
unto the Lord for strength <291 the time that the robbers <14
come down <10 them.

3:13 Yea, he sent a proclamation among all the <445 that they <21
gather together <169 women, and <3 children, <2 flocks and <3
herds, and all <5 substance, save it were <5 land, unto one
place.

3:14 And he caused that fortifications <37 be built round about
them, and the <74 <305 <11 be <192 great. And he
<21 that armies, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of
all them who were numbered <80 the <201 <29 be placed as
guards <43 <43 to watch <44 and to guard them from the <116
day and night.

3:15 Yea, he said unto them: As the Lord liveth, <285 ye repent of
all your iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, ye will in no wise be
delivered out of the hands of <231 Gadianton <229

3:16 And so great and marvelous were the words and prophecies of
<306 that they did <200 fear to come upon all the people; and
they did exert <273 in <154 might to do according to the <31
of Lachoneus.

3:17 And it came to pass that <40 did appoint chief captains over
all the armies of the <133 to command them at the time that the
<125 <143 come down out of the wilderness <244 <244

3:18 Now the chiefest <162 all the <39 <39 and the <96
commander of the <42 of the <190 was appointed, and his name was
Gidgiddoni.

3:19 Now it was the custom <33 all the <21 to <75 for <100
<39 captains, (save it were in <8 times of wickedness) some one
that had the spirit of revelation and also prophecy; therefore, this
Gidgiddoni was a <63 prophet <39 <222 as also was the <36 judge.

3:20 Now the <358 said unto Gidgiddoni: Pray unto the <205 and let
us go up upon the mountains and into the wilderness, that we may fall
upon the <131 and destroy them in <71 own lands.

3:21 But <60 saith unto <259 The Lord forbid; for if we <153
go up <150 them the Lord would deliver us into <30 hands;
<446 we will prepare ourselves in the center of our lands, and we
will <401 all our <158 together, and we will not go <36 <105
but we will wait till they shall come <11 us; <38 as the Lord
<320 if we do this he will <56 them into our hands.

3:22 And it came to pass in the seventeenth year, in the latter end of
the <8 the <472 of <270 had gone forth throughout all
the face of the <455 and they had taken <98 horses, and <3
chariots, and <4 cattle, and all <4 flocks, and <3 <484 and
<4 grain, and all <4 <488 and did march <40 by thousands
and by tens of thousands, until they had all gone <14 to the place
which had been appointed that they <162 <133 <363 <131
to defend <5 <119 <39 enemies.

3:23 And the land <24 was <23 was the land of Zarahemla, and
the land <12 was between the land Zarahemla and the land Bountiful,
yea, to the line <15 was <15 the land Bountiful and the land
Desolation.

3:24 And there were a <293 many thousand <280 who were called
<398 who did <74 <69 together in this land. Now
<151 did <459 that they <88 <14 <14 <14 in the
land southward, because of the <36 curse <57 was upon the land
northward.

3:25 And they did fortify <27 <110 <110 enemies; and they
did dwell in one <185 and in one body, and they did fear the <490
<38 had been spoken by Lachoneus, insomuch that they did repent of
all <35 sins; and they did put up <7 prayers unto the Lord <5
God, that he <325 <269 them in the time that <12 enemies <92
come down <66 them to battle.

3:26 And they were exceedingly sorrowful <100 of <21 <190 And
<375 did <120 that they <28 make weapons of war of every
kind, and they <11 be strong with armor, and with shields, and with
bucklers, after the manner of his instruction.

3 Nephi Chapter 4

4:1 And it came to pass that in the <333 end of the eighteenth year
those <393 of <451 had prepared for battle, and began to come down
and to sally <291 from the hills, and out of the mountains, and the
<485 and <95 strongholds, and <3 secret places, and <29
to take possession of the <445 both <170 were in the land south and
<8 were in the land north, and <24 to take <23 of all the
lands <16 had been deserted by the <268 and the cities <10 had
been left desolate.

4:2 But behold, <295 were no wild beasts nor game in <101 <32 <22
had been <33 by the <33 and <19 was no game for the
<116 save it were in the wilderness.

4:3 And the <13 could not exist save it were in the <112 for
the want of food; for the Nephites had left <119 <52 desolate, and
had gathered <7 flocks and <3 herds and all <4 <460 and
they were in one body.

4:4 Therefore, <69 was no chance for the <55 to plunder and to
obtain food, save it were to come up in open battle <283 the
Nephites; and the <60 being in one <345 and having so <381 a
number, and <7 reserved for <372 provisions, and horses and
cattle, and <73 of <285 <284 that they might subsist for the space
of seven years, in the <148 time they did hope to destroy the <72
from off the face of the land; and thus the <274 year did pass
away.

4:5 And it came to pass that in the nineteenth year Giddianhi found
that it was expedient that he <344 go up to <101 <101 the
<198 for <129 was no way that they <183 <76 save it were to
<134 and rob and murder.

4:6 And they durst not spread <111 upon the face of the land
<462 that they <32 raise grain, lest the <143 <54 come
upon them and slay them; therefore <72 gave commandment unto his
<368 that in this year they <21 go up to <75 <75 the
Nephites.

4:7 And it came to pass that they did come up to battle; and it was in
the sixth month; and <317 <192 and terrible was the day that they
did come up to <24 and they were girded about <461 the <461 of
robbers; and they had a lamb-skin <12 <274 loins, and they were dyed
in blood, and <10 heads were shorn, and they had head-plates upon
<100 and <53 and <53 was the appearance of the <102 of
Giddianhi, because of <26 armor, and <5 of <5 <272 dyed in
blood.

4:8 And it came to pass that the <28 of the <194 when they saw
the <40 of the army of <39 had all fallen to the earth,
and did lift <42 cries to the Lord <5 God, that he would spare
them and deliver them out of the hands of <16 enemies.

4:9 And it came to pass that when the <60 of <198 saw this they
<504 to shout with a loud voice, <93 of <30 joy, for they had
supposed that the <231 had <70 with fear <16 of the terror
of <20 armies.

4:10 But in this thing they were disappointed, for the <26 did not
fear <154 but they did fear <25 God and did supplicate him for
protection; therefore, when the <73 of <73 did rush upon them
they were prepared to meet <30 yea, in the strength of the Lord they
did receive them.

4:11 And the <285 commenced in this the <263 <263 and <209 and
<210 was the <14 thereof, yea, <9 and <8 was the
slaughter <9 <344 that <381 never was known so <15 a
<12 among all the people of Lehi since he left Jerusalem.

4:12 And notwithstanding the threatenings and the oaths <470 <88
had made, <317 the <118 did beat them, <43 that they did
fall back from before <84

4:13 And it came to pass that Gidgiddoni commanded that his <124
<383 pursue them as far as the borders of the wilderness, and that
they <15 not <241 any that <5 fall into <161 <239 by the way;
and thus they did <32 them and did slay <65 to the <34 of the
<35 even until they had fulfilled the <445 of
Gidgiddoni.

4:14 And it came to pass that <311 who had stood and fought with
boldness, was pursued as he fled; and <356 weary <252 of his much
fighting he was overtaken and slain. And thus was the end of <136
the robber.

4:15 And it came to pass that the <117 of the <148 did return
again to <101 place of security. And it came to pass that this
nineteenth year did pass away, and the robbers did not come <25 to
<485 neither did they come <8 in the twentieth year.

4:16 And in the twenty and first year they did not come up to battle,
but they came up on all sides to lay siege round <508 the <247 of
Nephi; for they did suppose that if they <183 cut off the <15 of
Nephi from <88 lands, and <12 hem them in on every side, and if
they <11 cut them off from all <20 outward privileges, that they
could cause them to yield themselves up according to <15 wishes.

4:17 Now they had appointed unto <15 another leader, whose name
was Zemnarihah; therefore it was Zemnarihah that did <33 that this
<88 <51 take place.

4:18 But <317 this was an advantage to the Nephites; for it was
impossible for the <157 to lay <27 sufficiently long to have any
effect upon the Nephites, <231 of <69 much provision <356 they
had laid up in store,

4:19 And <18 of the scantiness of provisions <396 the robbers—for
<57 they had nothing save it were meat for <35 subsistence, <34
meat they did obtain in the wilderness;

4:20 And it came to pass that the wild game became scarce in the
wilderness—insomuch that the <83 were <195 to perish with hunger.

4:21 And the <278 were continually marching out by day and by
night, and falling upon <59 armies, and cutting them off by thousands
and by tens of thousands.

4:22 And thus it <56 the desire of the <229 of <169 to
withdraw from <33 design, <113 of the <510 destruction <97 came
upon them by night and by day.

4:23 And it came to pass that <32 did give command unto his
<41 that they <203 <40 <224 from the siege, and march
into the furthermost parts of the land northward.

4:24 And now, <509 <423 aware of <64 <64 and knowing of
<6 weakness <70 of the want of food, and the <75 slaughter
<76 had been made <192 <493 <266 he did send out his <423 in
the night-time, and did cut off the way of <37 retreat, and did <429
his <19 in the way of <12 retreat.

4:25 And this did they do in the <33 and got on <17 <93
beyond the robbers, so that on the morrow, when the <209 began <15
march, they were met by the <45 of the <209 both in <14 front
and in <5 rear.

4:26 And the <29 who were on the south were also cut off in <19
places of <73 And all these things were done by <171 of
Gidgiddoni.

4:27 And there were many <239 who did <417 <178 up
prisoners unto the <353 and the remainder of them were slain.

4:28 And <47 <420 Zemnarihah, was taken and hanged upon a tree,
yea, even upon the top thereof until he was dead. And when they had
<20 him <11 he was dead they did fell the tree to the earth, and
did cry with a loud voice, saying:

4:29 May the Lord preserve his <260 in righteousness and in holiness
of heart, that they may <477 to be felled to the earth all who shall
seek to slay them <249 of power and secret combinations, even as
this man hath been <25 to the earth.

4:30 And they did rejoice and cry again with one <68 <68 May the
God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, protect
this <78 in righteousness, so long as they <64 call on the name of
<150 God for protection.

4:31 And it came to pass that they did break forth, all as one, in
singing, and praising <26 God for the <336 thing <335 he had done
for <336 in preserving them from <464 into the hands of <22
enemies.

4:32 Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to the Most High God. And they did cry:
Blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty, the Most High God.

4:33 And <40 hearts were swollen with joy, unto the gushing out of
many tears, <167 of the <75 goodness of God in delivering them out
of the <70 of <30 enemies; and they knew it was <23 of <9
repentance and <4 humility that they had been delivered from an
everlasting destruction.

3 Nephi Chapter 5

5:1 And now behold, <333 was not a living soul <462 all the <180 of
the <394 who did doubt in the least the words of all the holy
prophets who had spoken; for they knew that it must needs be that they
must be fulfilled.

5:2 And they knew that it must be expedient that Christ had come,
<94 of the many signs <192 had been given, according to the <53
of the prophets; and <18 of the <429 <17 had come to pass
already they knew that it must <59 be that all <17 should come to
pass <35 to that <25 had been spoken.

5:3 Therefore they did forsake all <148 sins, and <3 abominations,
and <4 whoredoms, and did serve God with all diligence day and
night.

5:4 And now it came to pass that when they had <459 all the robbers
prisoners, insomuch that none did escape who were not slain, they did
cast <46 <499 into prison, and did <418 the word of God to be
preached unto them; and as many as would repent of <24 sins and enter
into a covenant that they <13 murder no more were set at liberty.

5:5 But as many as <225 were who did not <28 into a covenant, and
who did still continue to have those <461 murders in <47 hearts,
yea, as many as were found breathing out threatenings against <13
brethren were condemned and punished <160 to the law.

5:6 And thus they did put an end to all <41 wicked, and secret, and
abominable <507 in the <184 <69 was so much wickedness, and
so many <59 committed.

5:7 And thus had the twenty and second year passed away, and the <8
and third year also, and the <8 and fourth, and the <5 and
fifth; and thus had <7 and five years <28 away.

5:8 And <58 had many <255 transpired which, in the eyes of some,
<155 be <418 and marvelous; nevertheless, they cannot all be written
in this book; yea, this book <11 contain even a hundredth part of
what was done <387 so many <387 in the space of <60 and five
years;

5:9 But behold <60 are records <122 do <34 all the proceedings
of this people; and a shorter but true account was given by Nephi.

5:10 <322 I have made my record of these <92 <182 to the
<8 of Nephi, <40 was engraven on the plates <6 were called the
<6 of <34

5:11 And <475 I do make the <27 on <15 <21 I have made with
mine own hands.

5:12 And <22 I am <36 Mormon, being <3 after the land of
<8 the land in <30 Alma did establish the church <125 the
people, yea, the first <8 <14 was established <11 them <28
<274 transgression.

5:13 Behold, I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I have
been <53 of him to declare his word <33 his <43 that they
might have everlasting life.

5:14 And it hath become expedient that I, <135 to the will of God,
that the prayers of <311 who have gone hence, who were the holy ones,
<504 be fulfilled <25 to <77 faith, <7 make a <136 of
<172 <172 <94 have been done—

5:15 Yea, a small <16 of that <14 hath <480 place from the time
that Lehi left Jerusalem, even down until the present time.

5:16 <217 I do make my <30 from the accounts <31 have been
<237 by <77 who were before me, <28 the commencement of my day;

5:17 And then I do make a <31 of the <76 <31 I have seen with
mine own eyes.

5:18 And I know the <21 <18 I make to be a just and a true record;
nevertheless <315 are many <35 <374 <124 to our language, we
are not able to write.

5:19 And now I make an end of my saying, <42 is of myself, and
proceed to give my <336 of the <39 <14 have been <99 me.

5:20 I am <273 and a pure descendant of Lehi. I have reason to bless
my God and my Savior <254 <254 that he brought our fathers out of
the land of <167 (and no one knew it save it were himself and
<153 whom he <24 out of that land) and that he hath <167 me and
my <445 so much knowledge unto the salvation of our souls.

5:21 Surely he hath blessed the house of Jacob, and hath been merciful
unto the seed of Joseph.

5:22 And insomuch as the children of Lehi have kept his commandments he
hath <33 them and prospered them <164 to his word.

5:23 Yea, and surely shall he again bring a remnant of the seed of
Joseph to the <77 of the Lord <315 God.

5:24 And as <27 as the Lord liveth, will he gather in from the four
quarters of the earth all the <40 of the seed of <95 who are
scattered abroad upon all the face of the earth.

5:25 And as he hath covenanted with all the <122 of <27 even so
<81 the covenant wherewith he hath <16 with the <15 of Jacob
be <395 in his own due time, unto the restoring all the <16 of
<17 unto the <98 of the <32 that he hath <32 with
them.

5:26 And then <48 they know <114 Redeemer, who is <244 <244 the
Son of God; and then <16 they be gathered in from the four <114
of the <115 unto <27 own lands, from whence they have been
dispersed; yea, as the Lord liveth so <30 it be. Amen.

3 Nephi Chapter 6

6:1 And now it came to pass that the <264 of the Nephites did all
return to <48 own lands in the twenty and sixth year, every man, with
his family, his flocks and his herds, his horses and his cattle, and
all <373 whatsoever did belong unto <118

6:2 And it came to pass that they had not eaten up all <50
provisions; therefore they did take with them all that they had not
devoured, of all <18 grain of <62 kind, and <6 gold, and <3
silver, and all <5 precious things, and they did <90 to <8 own
<91 and <5 possessions, both on the north and on the south, both
on the land northward and on the land southward.

6:3 And they granted unto <414 robbers who had entered into a <223
to keep the peace of the land, who were desirous to remain Lamanites,
<193 <366 to <55 numbers, that they might have, with <7
labors, <283 to subsist upon; and thus they did establish <33 in
all the land.

6:4 And they began <387 to prosper and to wax great; and the <186
and <187 and seventh years passed away, and there was great order in
the land; and they had formed <56 laws <67 to equity and
justice.

6:5 And now <26 was nothing in all the land to hinder the <246 from
prospering continually, except they should fall into transgression.

6:6 And now it was Gidgiddoni, and the judge, Lachoneus, and <138 who
had been appointed leaders, who had established this <70 <105 in the
<104

6:7 And it came to pass that <62 were many cities built anew, and
<8 were many old <9 repaired.

6:8 And <11 were many highways cast up, and many roads made, which
led from city to city, and from land to <190 and from place to place.

6:9 And thus <143 away the <153 and eighth <339 and the <113 had
continual peace.

6:10 But it came to pass in the <22 and ninth year <62 <190 to be
some disputings among the people; and some were lifted up unto pride
and boastings because of <179 exceedingly <121 riches, yea, even unto
<6 persecutions;

6:11 For <37 were many merchants in the <84 and also many lawyers,
and many officers.

6:12 And the <78 <58 to be distinguished by ranks, <220 to
<46 riches and <3 chances for learning, yea, some were ignorant
<60 of <11 poverty, and others did receive <58 learning <10
of <11 riches.

6:13 Some were <88 up in pride, and <21 were <85 humble;
some did <395 railing for railing, while <12 would <33 <7
and persecution and all manner of afflictions, and <12 not turn and
revile again, but were humble and penitent before God.

6:14 And thus <114 became a <66 inequality in all the <116 insomuch
that the church <106 to be broken up; yea, <11 that in the
thirtieth year the <15 was <13 up in all the land save it were
<184 a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true faith;
and they <76 not depart from it, for they were firm, and steadfast,
and immovable, willing with all diligence to keep the commandments of
the Lord.

6:15 Now the cause of this iniquity of the <187 was this—Satan had
<96 power, unto the stirring up of the <13 to do all <135 of
iniquity, and to the puffing them up with <169 tempting them to seek
for <29 and authority, and <259 and the vain things of the world.

6:16 And thus Satan did lead away the hearts of the <48 to do all
<49 of iniquity; therefore they had enjoyed <414 but a few years.

6:17 And thus, in the commencement of the <158 year—the <30
having been delivered up for the space of a long time to be carried
about by the temptations of the devil whithersoever he desired to carry
them, and to do whatsoever <129 he <11 they should—and thus in
the <49 of this, the <50 <408 they were in a state of
awful wickedness.

6:18 Now they did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of God
concerning <48 for it had been taught unto them; <108 they did
wilfully rebel against God.

6:19 And now it was in the days of Lachoneus, the son of <4 for
Lachoneus did fill the seat of his father and did govern the <125
that year.

6:20 And <319 <306 to be men inspired from heaven and sent forth,
standing <292 the <24 in all the <330 preaching and testifying
boldly of the sins and iniquities of the people, and <12 unto
them <95 the redemption which the Lord <307 make for his
<17 or in other words, the resurrection of Christ; and they did
testify <39 of his death and sufferings.

6:21 Now <74 were many of the <64 who were <444 angry
<465 of those who testified of these things; and <7 who were
<15 were chiefly the chief judges, and they who had been high priests
and lawyers; yea, all <22 who were lawyers were <23 with <7 who
<37 of <37 things.

6:22 Now <61 was no lawyer nor judge nor high priest that could have
power to condemn any one to <88 save their condemnation was signed by
the governor of the land.

6:23 Now <37 were many of <53 who <52 of the <363
pertaining to Christ who <9 boldly, who were taken and put to
<42 secretly by the <97 that the knowledge of <49 <10 came
not unto the <49 of the land until after <13 death.

6:24 Now behold, this was contrary to the laws of the <215 that any
man should be put to <37 except they had <99 from the <38 of
the land—

6:25 Therefore a complaint came up unto the land of Zarahemla, to the
<22 of the <41 <318 <149 judges who had condemned the
prophets of the Lord unto death, not according to the law.

6:26 Now it came to pass that they were <116 and brought up before the
<174 to be judged of the crime <280 they had done, <34 to the
law <9 had been given by the people.

6:27 Now it came to pass that <171 <70 had many friends and
kindreds; and the remainder, yea, even almost all the <244 and the
high priests, did gather themselves together, and unite with the
kindreds of <33 <33 who were to be tried <62 to the law.

6:28 And they did enter into a covenant one with another, yea, even
into that <9 <81 was <80 by them of old, <7 <9 was
<9 and administered by the devil, to combine <154 all
righteousness.

6:29 <179 they did <12 <12 the <365 of the Lord, and
<52 into a <34 to destroy <512 and to deliver <80 who were
guilty of murder from the grasp of justice, <54 was about to be
<54 <92 to the law.

6:30 And they did set at defiance the law and the rights of <281
country; and they did <52 one with another to <55 the
governor, and to establish a king over the <246 that the land <286
no more be at liberty but <8 be subject unto kings.

3 Nephi Chapter 7

7:1 Now <325 I will show unto you that they did not <44 a king
over the land; but in this same year, yea, the thirtieth <4 they did
<69 upon the judgment seat, yea, did <120 the <486 <275 of the
<427

7:2 And the <156 were divided one <162 another; and they did
separate one from <105 into tribes, every man <139 to his
family and his kindred and friends; and thus they did <53 the
government of the <45

7:3 And <28 tribe did appoint a <61 or a leader over them; and thus
they became tribes and leaders of tribes.

7:4 Now <120 <499 was no man among them save he had much <59 and
many <307 and <60 therefore <190 <30 <32 exceedingly
great.

7:5 Now all this was <379 and <34 were no wars as yet <36 <58
and all this iniquity had come upon the <122 because they did yield
<357 unto the <484 of Satan.

7:6 And the regulations of the <108 were destroyed, <23 of
the secret combination of the <403 and <71 of <298 who
murdered the prophets.

7:7 And they did cause a great contention in the <256 insomuch that
the more righteous part of the <65 had nearly all become wicked;
yea, <90 were but few <16 men <90 them.

7:8 And thus six years had not passed away since the more part of the
<35 had turned from <137 righteousness, like the dog to his vomit,
or like the sow to her wallowing in the mire.

7:9 Now this <101 combination, <381 had brought so <84 <141
upon the people, did <494 <137 <494 and did place at <45
head a man whom they did call Jacob;

7:10 And they did call him <19 king; <204 he <203 a king over
this wicked band; and he was one of the chiefest who had <489 his
voice <311 the prophets who testified of Jesus.

7:11 And it came to pass that they were not so strong in number as the
<252 of the <83 who were united together save it were <63
<293 did <397 <5 laws, <316 one <344 to his tribe;
nevertheless they were enemies; notwithstanding they were not a
<178 <33 yet they were <34 in the hatred of <229 who had
entered into a <489 to <364 the government.

7:12 Therefore, Jacob seeing that <49 enemies were more numerous than
they, he being the king of the band, <130 he commanded his <204
that they <497 take <25 flight into the northernmost part of the
<264 and <248 build up unto <182 a kingdom, until they were
joined by dissenters, (for he flattered them that <19 would be many
dissenters) and they <279 sufficiently <136 to contend with the
<136 of the people; and they did so.

7:13 And so speedy was <62 march that it could not be impeded <52
they had gone forth out of the reach of the people. And thus ended the
thirtieth year; and thus were the affairs of the <103 of Nephi.

7:14 And it came to pass in the thirty and first year that they were
divided into tribes, <194 man <194 to his family, kindred and
<476 <197 they had come to an agreement that they <110 not
go to war one with another; but they were not <204 as to <95 <231
and <4 manner of government, for they were established <45 to
the minds of <220 who were <17 chiefs and <3 leaders. But they
did <262 very strict laws that one tribe <196 not trespass
<315 another, <454 that in some degree they had peace in the
land; nevertheless, <32 hearts were <424 from the Lord <7 God,
and they did stone the <343 and did cast them out from <466 <466

7:15 And it came to pass that Nephi—having been visited by angels and
also the <374 of the Lord, <270 having seen angels, and <281
eye-witness, and <8 had power <393 unto him that he might know
concerning the ministry of Christ, and also <22 eye-witness to <70
quick return from righteousness unto <7 wickedness and abominations;

7:16 <334 <19 grieved for the hardness of <15 <99 and the
blindness of <7 minds—went <246 <87 them in that same year, and
began to testify, boldly, repentance and remission of sins through
faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.

7:17 And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them cannot
be written, and a part of them <231 not suffice, <115 they are
not written in this book. And Nephi did <33 with <118 and with
great authority.

7:18 And it came to pass that they were angry with him, even because he
had greater <27 than <436 for it were not possible that they <360
disbelieve his words, for so <40 was his <95 on the Lord <95
Christ that <193 did <59 unto him daily.

7:19 And in the name of <19 did he cast out devils and unclean
spirits; and even his brother did he raise from the dead, after he had
been stoned and suffered death by the <408

7:20 And the <400 saw it, and did witness of it, and were <100 with
him <100 of his power; and he did also do many more miracles, in the
sight of the people, in the name of Jesus.

7:21 And it came to pass that the <435 and <435 year did pass away,
and there were but few who were converted unto the Lord; but as many as
were <10 did truly signify unto the <80 that they had been
<334 by the <170 and Spirit of God, which was in <135 <311 in
whom they believed.

7:22 And as many as had <146 cast out from them, and were healed of
<301 sicknesses and <3 infirmities, did <53 manifest unto the
<54 that they had been wrought upon by the <52 of God, and had
been healed; and they did show <331 signs also and did do some
miracles <339 the <173

7:23 Thus passed away the <126 and second year also. And <293 did
cry unto the <53 in the commencement of the <18 and third year;
and he did preach unto them <367 and <367 of sins.

7:24 Now I <340 have you to remember also, that <164 were none who
were brought unto <26 who were not baptized with water.

7:25 <433 <20 were ordained of Nephi, men unto this ministry,
that all such as should come unto them <4 be <28 with water,
and this as a <265 and a testimony before God, and unto the <247
that they had repented and received a <82 of <164 <83

7:26 And <55 were many in the <112 of this year that were
<47 unto repentance; and thus the more part of the year did pass
away.

3 <147 Chapter 8

8:1 And now it came to pass that according to our record, and we know
our record to be true, for behold, it was a just man who did keep the
record—for he <240 did many <209 in the name of Jesus; and <82
was not any man who <457 do a miracle in the name of <297 save he
were cleansed every whit from his iniquity—

8:2 And now it came to pass, if <37 was no mistake made by this man
in the reckoning of our time, the <239 and <239 year had <265
away;

8:3 And the <259 began to look with great earnestness for the sign
<363 had been given by the prophet Samuel, the Lamanite, yea, for the
time that <57 <214 be darkness for the space of three days over the
face of the land.

8:4 And <22 <49 to be <48 doubtings and disputations <339 the
<227 notwithstanding so many <354 had been given.

8:5 And it came to pass in the <93 and fourth year, in the <480
month, on the <9 day of the <7 <46 arose a <45 storm, such
an one as never had been known in all the <69

8:6 And <23 was also a <24 and terrible tempest; and <9 was
<6 thunder, insomuch that it did shake the whole earth as if it
was about to divide asunder.

8:7 And <27 were exceedingly sharp lightnings, such as <56 had been
<57 in all the <57

8:8 And the city of Zarahemla did take fire.

8:9 And the city of Moroni did sink into the depths of the sea, and the
inhabitants thereof were drowned.

8:10 And the <73 was carried up upon the city of Moronihah that in
the place of the city <75 became a <110 mountain.

8:11 And <10 was a <10 and <114 destruction in the land
southward.

8:12 But <346 <18 was a more <19 and <19 <19 in the
land northward; for <15 the <135 face of the land was changed,
because of the tempest and the whirlwinds and the thunderings and the
<136 and the <141 <37 quaking of the <29 earth;

8:13 And the highways were broken up, and the level roads were spoiled,
and many smooth places <95 rough.

8:14 And many <35 and notable cities were sunk, and many were burned,
and many were shaken till the buildings <148 had fallen to the
earth, and the <158 <10 were slain, and the <42 were left
desolate.

8:15 And <119 were some <43 <369 remained; but the damage <24
was <91 great, and <15 were many of them who were slain.

8:16 And <13 were some who were <195 away in the whirlwind; and
whither they went no man knoweth, save they know that they were <19
away.

8:17 And thus the face of the <139 <230 <118 deformed, <164 of
the tempests, and the thunderings, and the <161 and the <159
of the earth.

8:18 And <197 the rocks were rent in twain; they were <165 up upon
the face of the <44 <129 <355 that they were found in <16
fragments, and in seams and in cracks, upon all the face of the <339

8:19 And it came to pass that when the <69 and the <69
and the <429 and the tempest, and the quakings of the <95 did
cease—for <73 they did last for <401 the space of three hours; and
it was said by some that the time was greater; nevertheless, all these
<235 and <307 things were done in <29 the <29 of <29
hours—and then <42 <180 was darkness upon the face of the <84

8:20 And it came to pass that <19 was thick <20 upon all the
face of the land, <128 that the <258 <234 who had not
<271 could feel the vapor of darkness;

8:21 And <33 <12 be no light, <196 of the darkness, neither
candles, <3 torches; <2 <14 <16 be fire kindled with
their fine and <273 dry wood, so that <14 <16 not be any
light at all;

8:22 And <14 was not any <12 seen, <36 fire, nor glimmer,
<5 the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so <134 were the
mists of <102 <329 were upon the face of the <124

8:23 And it came to pass that it did last for the <155 of <155 days
that <58 was no <57 seen; and <6 was <44 mourning and howling
and weeping among all the people continually; yea, <13 were the
groanings of the people, <126 of the <62 and the <14
<511 <67 had come upon them.

8:24 And in one place they were heard to cry, saying: O that we had
repented before this <30 and <235 day, and then would our
brethren have been spared, and they <9 not have been burned in that
<23 city Zarahemla.

8:25 And in another <48 they were <48 to cry and mourn, <50 O
that we had <50 <50 this <27 and <50 day, and had not
killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them out; then <53 our
mothers and our fair daughters, and our children have been <69 and
not have been buried up in that <41 city Moronihah. And thus were the
howlings of the <149 <12 and terrible.

3 Nephi Chapter 9

9:1 And it came to pass that <182 was a voice <91 <178 all the
<317 of the <452 upon all the face of this <331 crying:

9:2 Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo unto the <25 of the <478
<428 except they shall repent; for the devil laugheth, and his angels
rejoice, <212 of the slain of the fair sons and daughters of my
<36 and it is <17 of <340 iniquity and abominations that they
are fallen!

9:3 Behold, that <107 city Zarahemla have I <196 with <333 and the
<64 thereof.

9:4 And <448 that <20 city Moroni have I caused to be sunk in the
depths of the sea, and the <27 <433 to be drowned.

9:5 And <30 that <30 city Moronihah have I covered with <132
and the <23 thereof, to hide <80 iniquities and <3
<82 from <234 my face, that the blood of the prophets and
the saints <130 not come any more unto me against <326

9:6 And <51 the city of Gilgal have I <81 to be sunk, and the
<52 <75 to be <240 up in the <89 of the earth;

9:7 Yea, and the city of Onihah and the <24 <76 and the
city of Mocum and the <10 <10 and the city of Jerusalem
and the <10 thereof; and waters have I <57 to come up in the
stead <23 to hide <106 wickedness and <107 from <107 my
<108 that the <108 of the <108 and the <107 <107 not come up
any more unto me <109 <109

9:8 And <109 the city of Gadiandi, and the city of Gadiomnah, and
the city of Jacob, and the city of Gimgimno, all these have I <70 to
be <128 and made hills and valleys in the places <88 and the
<93 <137 have I <137 up in the <137 of the <204 to
hide <91 <91 and <91 from <91 my <90 that the
<91 of the <91 and the <91 should not come up any more unto
me <91 <91

9:9 And <91 that <251 city Jacobugath, which was inhabited by the
<418 of king <90 have I <83 to be <314 with fire <339 of
<60 sins and <3 wickedness, <26 was above all the <69 of
the <389 <79 <19 of <15 secret murders and combinations; for
it was they that did destroy the peace of my <50 and the government
of the land; therefore I did cause them to be burned, to <22 them
from <111 my <111 that the <110 of the <110 and the <110
<111 not come up unto me any more <110 <110

9:10 And <110 the city of Laman, and the city of Josh, and the city
of Gad, and the city of Kishkumen, have I <116 to be <116 with
<431 and the <191 <271 <102 of <102 <111 in
casting out the prophets, and stoning those whom I did send to declare
unto them concerning <21 <21 and <3 abominations.

9:11 And <33 they did cast them all out, that there were none
righteous among them, I did send down fire and <120 <8 that <31
<35 and <236 might be hid from <128 my <128 that the
<129 of the <129 and the <129 whom I sent <36 them <22 not
cry unto me from the ground <134 <134

9:12 And many <243 destructions have I <116 to come upon this land,
and upon this people, <83 of <61 <60 and <3
<96

9:13 O all ye that are spared <18 ye were more <93 than they,
will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be
converted, that I may heal you?

9:14 Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me ye <431 have
eternal life. Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and
whosoever will come, him will I receive; and blessed are <194 who come
unto me.

9:15 <31 I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. I created the heavens
and the <335 and all things that in them are. I was with the Father
from the beginning. I am in the Father, and the <12 in me; and in me
hath the <9 glorified his name.

9:16 I came unto my own, and my own received me not. And the scriptures
<266 my coming are fulfilled.

9:17 And as many as have <21 me, to them have I given to become
the sons of God; and even so will I to as many as <145 believe on my
name, for <366 by me redemption cometh, and in me is the law of
Moses <54

9:18 I am the light and the life of the world. I am Alpha and Omega,
the beginning and the end.

9:19 And ye <53 offer up unto me no more the shedding of blood; yea,
your sacrifices and your burnt offerings <19 be done away, for I will
accept none of your <17 and your <17 offerings.

9:20 And ye <23 <42 for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a
contrite spirit. And whoso cometh unto me with a <14 <14 and a
<14 spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost,
even as the Lamanites, <331 of <346 faith in me at the time of
<9 conversion, were baptized with fire and with the Holy <27 and
they knew it not.

9:21 <281 I have come unto the world to bring <171 unto the
world, to save the <11 from sin.

9:22 Therefore, <86 repenteth and <88 unto me as a little child,
him will I receive, for of such is the kingdom of God. <48 for such
I have laid down my life, and have taken it up again; therefore repent,
and come unto me ye ends of the <340 and be saved.

3 Nephi Chapter 10

10:1 And now <257 it came to pass that all the people of the land
did hear these sayings, and did witness of it. And after <9 sayings
there was silence in the land for the space of many hours;

10:2 For so great was the astonishment of the <43 that they did
cease lamenting and howling for the loss of <177 kindred which had
been slain; <99 <45 was <45 in all the land for the <46
of many hours.

10:3 And it came to pass that <24 came a voice again unto the people,
and all the <57 did hear, and did <94 of it, saying:

10:4 O ye <15 of <101 <81 cities <62 have fallen, who are
descendants of Jacob, yea, who are of the house of Israel, how oft have
I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and
have nourished you.

10:5 And again, how oft would I have <27 you as a hen <27
her <28 <28 her <28 yea, O ye <69 of the <53 of <53
who have fallen; yea, O ye <13 of the <13 of <13 ye that dwell
at Jerusalem, as ye that have <20 yea, how oft <51 I have
<52 you as a hen <52 her chickens, and ye <14 not.

10:6 O ye <39 of Israel whom I have spared, how oft will I gather you
as a hen <30 her <81 <81 her <81 if ye will repent and
return unto me with full purpose of heart.

10:7 But if not, O <45 of <84 the places of your dwellings <469
become desolate until the time of the fulfilling of the covenant to
your fathers.

10:8 And now it came to pass that <305 the <125 had heard <208
words, <336 they began to weep and howl <243 <468 of the loss of
<286 <286 and friends.

10:9 And it came to pass that thus did the three days pass away. And it
was in the morning, and the darkness dispersed from off the face of the
land, and the earth did <338 to tremble, and the rocks did <7 to
rend, and the dreadful groanings did cease, and all the tumultuous
noises did pass <49

10:10 And the <34 did cleave together <259 that it stood; and the
mourning, and the weeping, and the wailing of the <116 who were
spared alive did cease; and <105 mourning was turned into joy, and
<8 lamentations into the praise and thanksgiving unto the Lord Jesus
Christ, <13 Redeemer.

10:11 And thus far were the scriptures fulfilled <361 had been spoken
by the prophets.

10:12 And it was the more righteous part of the <64 who were saved,
and it was they who received the prophets and stoned them not; and it
was they who had not shed the blood of the saints, who were spared—

10:13 And they were <101 and were not sunk and buried up in the
earth; and they were not drowned in the depths of the sea; and they
were not burned by fire, neither were they fallen upon and crushed to
death; and they were not carried away in the whirlwind; <19 were
they overpowered by the vapor of smoke and of darkness.

10:14 And now, whoso readeth, let him understand; he that hath the
scriptures, let him search them, and see and behold if all <308 deaths
and destructions by <66 and by smoke, and by tempests, and by
whirlwinds, and by the opening of the <238 to receive <33 and all
<30 things are not unto the <368 of the prophecies of many of
the holy <191

10:15 Behold, I say unto you, Yea, many have testified of <31 <31
at the coming of <234 and were slain <369 they <15 of <15
things.

10:16 Yea, the prophet Zenos did testify of <14 things, and also
Zenock spake concerning <8 <8 <28 they <28
particularly <8 us, who are the remnant of <277 seed.

10:17 <67 our father Jacob also <21 <19 a <16 of
the seed of Joseph. And <439 are not we a <13 of the seed of
Joseph? And <49 <86 <301 <62 of us, are they not written upon
the plates of brass <14 our <45 Lehi brought out of Jerusalem?

10:18 And it came to pass that in the ending of the thirty and fourth
year, <57 I will show unto you that the <330 of Nephi who were
spared, and also those who had been called Lamanites, who had been
<13 did have great favors shown unto <199 and <6 blessings
poured out upon <121 heads, insomuch that soon after the ascension of
Christ into heaven he did truly manifest himself unto them—

10:19 Showing his body unto <36 and ministering unto them; and an
account of his ministry shall be given hereafter. Therefore for this
time I make an end of my sayings.

3 <92 Chapter 11

11:1 And now it came to pass that there were a <83 multitude gathered
together, of the <118 of Nephi, round about the temple <161 was in
the land Bountiful; and they were marveling and wondering one with
another, and were showing one to another the <38 and marvelous change
<29 had taken place. 3 <65 11:2 And they were also conversing <44
this Jesus <301 of whom the sign had been <101 <253 his
death.

11:3 And it came to pass that while they were thus <31 one with
<59 they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast
<182 eyes <97 about, for they understood not the <21 <72 they
heard; and it was not a harsh voice, <476 was it a loud voice;
nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small <26 it did pierce
them that did hear to the center, <227 that <157 was no part of
<55 frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did <29 them to
the very soul, and did <15 <22 hearts to burn.

11:4 And it came to pass that again they <107 the <75 and they
<93 it not.

11:5 And <16 the third time they did hear the <20 and did open
<43 ears to hear it; and <6 eyes were towards the sound thereof;
and they did look steadfastly <10 heaven, from whence the <13
came.

11:6 And <376 the <45 time they did understand the <125 <151
they <151 and it said unto them:

11:7 Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have
glorified my name—hear ye him.

11:8 And it came to pass, as they <106 they cast <82 eyes up
<105 <74 <219 and <64 they saw a Man descending out of
<11 and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood
in the midst of <395 and the eyes of the whole <356 were turned
upon him, and they durst not open <55 mouths, even one to <284
and wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an angel that had
appeared unto them.

11:9 And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake
unto the people, saying:

11:10 Behold, I am <365 <365 whom the prophets testified <466 come
into the world.

11:11 And <119 I am the light and the life of the world; and I have
drunk out of that bitter cup <195 the Father hath <399 me, and have
<176 the <9 in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the
<24 I have suffered the will of the <21 in all things from the
beginning.

11:12 And it came to pass that when <89 had spoken these words the
<163 <163 fell to the earth; for they remembered that it had been
prophesied among them that Christ should show himself unto them after
his ascension into heaven.

11:13 And it came to pass that the Lord <151 unto them <149

11:14 Arise and come <166 unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into
my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my <18
and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the
God of the <102 earth, and have been slain for the sins of the <198

11:15 And it came to pass that the <124 went forth, and <70
<282 <53 into his <70 and did feel the <67 of the <67 in his
<15 and in his feet; and this they did do, going <105 one by one
until they had all gone <41 and did see with <42 eyes and did feel
with <7 hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it
was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that <187 come.

11:16 And when they had all gone <60 and had witnessed for
themselves, they did cry out with one accord, <187

11:17 Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did
fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.

11:18 And it came to pass that he <231 unto Nephi (for <2 was <264
the multitude) and he commanded him that he <83 come forth.

11:19 And <20 arose and went <133 and bowed <283 before the Lord
and did kiss his feet.

11:20 And the Lord <36 him that he <36 arise. And he <31 and
<507 <28 him.

11:21 And the Lord said unto him: I give unto you power that ye <442
baptize this people when I am again ascended into <334

11:22 And <9 the Lord called others, and said unto them likewise;
and he gave unto them <36 to baptize. And he said unto them: On this
wise <45 ye baptize; and there <5 be no disputations <127 you.

11:23 Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins through
your <429 and desireth to be baptized in my name, on this wise <36
ye <87 them—Behold, ye <6 go down and stand in the water, and in
my name <13 ye <18 them.

11:24 And now behold, <472 are the <45 <506 ye <17 say, calling
them by <46 <249

11:25 Having authority given me of <498 Christ, I <35 you in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

11:26 And then <45 ye immerse them in the <74 and come <310 <160
out of the water.

11:27 And after this manner <24 ye <51 in my name; for <83
verily I say unto you, that the <57 and the Son, and the Holy Ghost
are one; and I am in the <16 and the Father in me, and the <5
and I are one.

11:28 And according as I have <277 you thus <58 ye <216 And
<205 <6 be no <205 <205 you, as <8 have hitherto been;
neither <13 <7 be <13 <13 you concerning the points of
my doctrine, as <13 have <20 been.

11:29 For verily, <92 I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of
contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of
contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger,
one with another.

11:30 Behold, this is not my <66 to stir up the <25 of men
with <24 one against another; but this is my <18 that such
things <396 be done away.

11:31 <36 <87 <1 I say unto you, I will declare unto you
my doctrine.

11:32 And this is my <36 and it is the doctrine <286 the <177
hath <275 unto me; and I bear record of the <197 and the <15
beareth <9 of me, and the Holy <218 <8 <8 of the <14
and me; and I bear <10 that the <10 commandeth all men,
everywhere, to repent and believe in me.

11:33 And <398 believeth in me, and is baptized, the same <205 be
saved; and they are they who <9 inherit the kingdom of God.

11:34 And <29 <29 not in me, and is not <31 <20 be
damned.

11:35 Verily, <132 I say unto you, that this is my <120 and I
bear <81 of it from the Father; and <39 <39 in me <3
in the <93 also; and unto him will the <7 bear <24 of me, for
he will visit him with fire and with the Holy <405

11:36 And thus will the <26 bear <26 of me, and the Holy <149
will bear <10 unto him of the <17 and me; for the <175 and I,
and the Holy <21 are one.

11:37 And <433 I say unto you, ye must repent, and become as a little
child, and be baptized in my <502 or ye can in nowise receive these
things.

11:38 And <35 I say unto you, ye must <35 and be <28 in my
<29 and <42 as a <42 <41 or ye can in <35 <188 the
<189 of God.

11:39 <171 <171 I say unto you, that this is my <171 and
<162 buildeth upon this <3 upon my rock, and the gates of hell
<206 not prevail <353 them.

11:40 And <24 <11 <334 more or less than this, and establish it
for my <41 the same cometh of evil, and is not built upon my
rock; but he <50 upon a sandy foundation, and the <51 of hell
stand open to <126 such when the floods come and the winds beat upon
<62

11:41 Therefore, go forth unto this people, and <66 the words <383
I have spoken, unto the ends of the earth.

3 Nephi Chapter 12

12:1 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken <184 <34 unto
Nephi, and to those who had been called, (now the number of them who
had been <10 and received power and authority to baptize, was
twelve) and behold, he stretched <76 his hand unto the multitude, and
cried unto them, saying: Blessed are ye if ye <155 give heed unto the
<58 of <61 twelve whom I have chosen from among you to minister
unto you, and to be your servants; and unto them I have <495 <62
that they may baptize you with water; and after that ye are <266
with water, <71 I will <16 you with fire and with the Holy
Ghost; therefore blessed are ye if ye <70 <489 in me and be
<450 <35 that ye have seen me and know that I am.

12:2 And again, more <31 are they who <30 <30 in your <98
because that ye <9 testify that ye have seen me, and that ye know
that I am. Yea, <29 are they who <20 <29 in your words, and
come down into the depths of humility and be <68 for they <19
be visited with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and <12 <273 a
remission of their sins.

12:3 Yea, <48 are the poor in spirit who come unto me, for theirs
is the <388 of heaven.

12:4 And <102 <24 are all they that mourn, for they <45 be
comforted.

12:5 And <17 are the meek, for they <15 <424 the <298

12:6 And <15 are all they who do hunger and thirst <160
righteousness, for they <23 be filled with the Holy Ghost.

12:7 And <26 are the merciful, for they <18 obtain mercy.

12:8 And <14 are all the pure in heart, for they <17 see God.

12:9 And <17 are all the peacemakers, for they <15 be called the
children of God.

12:10 And <20 are all they who are persecuted for my name’s sake,
for <135 is the <134 of <134

12:11 And <24 are ye when men <42 revile you and persecute, and
<7 say all manner of evil <511 you falsely, for my sake;

12:12 For ye <18 have great joy and be exceedingly glad, for <7
<11 be your reward in heaven; for so <67 they the prophets who
were before you.

12:13 Verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you to be the salt of
the earth; but if the salt <43 lose its savor wherewith <5 the
earth be salted? The salt <8 be thenceforth good for nothing, but to
be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.

12:14 <59 <59 I say unto you, I give unto you to be the light
of this people. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.

12:15 Behold, do men <23 a candle and put it <50 a bushel? Nay, but
on a candlestick, and it giveth <18 to all that are in the house;

12:16 Therefore let your <15 so shine <137 this people, that they
may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in <217

12:17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets. I am
not come to <12 but to fulfil;

12:18 For verily I say unto you, one jot nor tittle hath not passed
away from the law, but in me it hath all been fulfilled.

12:19 And behold, I have given you the law and the commandments of my
Father, that ye <193 <491 in me, and that ye <7 repent of your
sins, and come unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit.
<162 ye have the <37 <128 you, and the law is <59

12:20 <145 come unto me and be ye saved; for <97 I say unto
you, that except ye <53 keep my commandments, which I have commanded
you at this time, ye <14 in no case enter into the <379 of <162

12:21 Ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old <28 and it
is also written <76 you, that thou shalt not kill, and whosoever
<43 kill <2 be in danger of the judgment of God;

12:22 But I say unto you, that <23 is angry with his brother
<26 be in <26 of his judgment. And <15 <9 say to his
brother, Raca, <7 be in <16 of the council; and <16 <9
say, Thou fool, <5 be in <14 of hell fire.

12:23 Therefore, if ye <14 come unto me, or <5 desire to come unto
me, and rememberest that thy <62 hast aught <480 thee—

12:24 Go thy way unto thy <60 and first be reconciled to thy
<8 and then come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I will
receive you.

12:25 Agree with thine adversary quickly while thou art in the way with
him, lest at any time he <73 get thee, and thou <161 be cast into
prison.

12:26 <451 <451 I say unto <18 thou <17 by no means come out
thence until thou hast paid the uttermost senine. And <52 ye are in
prison can ye pay even one senine? <35 <35 I say unto you, Nay.

12:27 <302 it is <225 by them of old <236 that thou <50 not
commit adultery;

12:28 But I say unto you, that <185 looketh on a woman, to lust
after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.

12:29 <47 I give unto you a commandment, that ye suffer none of
these things to <313 into your heart;

12:30 For it is better that ye should deny yourselves of <21 things,
wherein ye will take up your cross, than that ye <17 be cast into
hell.

12:31 It hath been written, that <83 <171 put away his wife, let
him give her a writing of divorcement.

12:32 <139 <139 I say unto you, that <26 <26 put away his
<27 saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to <137
<138 and whoso <20 marry her who is divorced committeth
adultery.

12:33 And again it is <66 thou <164 not forswear thyself, but
<6 perform unto the Lord <264 oaths;

12:34 But <64 <1 I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by
heaven, for it is God’s throne;

12:35 Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool;

12:36 Neither <49 thou <33 by thy head, because thou canst not make
one hair black or white;

12:37 But let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever
cometh of more than <186 is evil.

12:38 And behold, it is <105 an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth;

12:39 But I say unto you, that ye <146 not resist evil, but <172
<7 smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also;

12:40 And if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat,
let him have thy cloak <26

12:41 And <46 <45 compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.

12:42 Give to him that asketh <415 and from him that would borrow of
thee turn not away.

12:43 And behold it is <392 also, that thou <169 love thy neighbor
and hate <220 enemy;

12:44 But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you,
do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use
you and persecute you;

12:45 That ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven; for
he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good.

12:46 Therefore those <422 which were of old <480 <5 were under
the law, in me are all fulfilled.

12:47 Old <22 are done away, and all <6 have become new.

12:48 <38 I <142 that ye <430 be perfect even as I, or your
<76 who is in heaven is perfect.

3 Nephi Chapter 13

13:1 <423 <358 I say that I <36 that ye <36 do alms unto the
poor; but take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of
them; otherwise ye have no reward of your <58 who is in heaven.

13:2 Therefore, when ye <249 do your alms do not sound a trumpet
<37 you, as will hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets,
that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their
reward.

13:3 But when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy <347
hand doeth;

13:4 That <264 alms may be in secret; and thy <87 who seeth in
secret, himself <82 <98 thee openly.

13:5 And when thou prayest thou <299 not do as the hypocrites, for
they love to pray, standing in the <92 and in the corners of the
<96 that they may be seen of men. <95 I say unto you, they have
<96 <95

13:6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou
hast shut thy door, pray to thy <85 who is in <92 and thy
Father, who <93 in <92 <91 <91 thee <91

13:7 But when ye <78 use not vain repetitions, as the heathen, for
they think that they <25 be heard for <68 much speaking.

13:8 Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your <58 knoweth what
<314 ye have need of <217 ye ask him.

13:9 After this manner <26 pray ye: Our <24 who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

13:10 Thy will be done on earth as it is in <274

13:11 And forgive us our debts, as we <6 our debtors.

13:12 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

13:13 For <234 is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever.
Amen.

13:14 For, if ye <43 men <121 trespasses your heavenly <85 will
also <10 you;

13:15 But if ye <9 not men <20 <20 neither will your
<22 <10 your trespasses.

13:16 Moreover, when ye fast be not as the <265 of a sad
countenance, for they disfigure <31 faces that they may appear unto
men to fast. <259 I say unto you, they have <18 <258

13:17 But <258 when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;

13:18 That thou <37 not unto men to fast, but unto thy <257 who
is in <266 and thy <8 who <265 in <265 <240 <265 thee
<266

13:19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
rust doth corrupt, and thieves break through and steal;

13:20 But lay up for <25 <25 in <233 <25 <136 moth
nor rust doth <26 and <9 <27 do not <29 <29 nor
steal.

13:21 For <14 your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

13:22 The light of the body is the eye; if, therefore, <226 eye be
single, thy whole body <97 be full of light.

13:23 But if <19 eye be evil, thy <18 body <18 be full of
darkness. If, <34 the <44 that is in thee be darkness, how
great is that darkness!

13:24 No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and
love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other.
Ye cannot <30 God and Mammon.

13:25 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he
looked upon the twelve whom he had chosen, and said unto them: Remember
the <18 which I have spoken. For behold, ye are they whom I have
chosen to minister unto this people. Therefore I say unto you, take no
thought for your life, what ye <131 eat, or what ye <5 drink; nor
yet for your body, what ye <10 put on. Is not the life more than
meat, and the body than raiment?

13:26 Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, <248 do they
reap nor gather into barns; yet your <414 <392 feedeth them. Are
ye not much better than they?

13:27 Which of you by taking <83 can add one cubit unto his
stature?

13:28 And why take ye <17 for <66 Consider the lilies of the
field how they grow; they toil not, <65 do they spin;

13:29 And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon, in all his <504 was
not arrayed like one of these.

13:30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, <186 today
is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, even so will he <21 you, if
ye are not of little faith.

13:31 <196 take no thought, saying, What <173 we eat? or, What
<6 we drink? or, Wherewithal <5 we be clothed?

13:32 For your <153 <153 knoweth that ye have need of all <271
things.

13:33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and
all <21 things <42 be added unto you.

13:34 Take therefore no <159 for the morrow, for the morrow <19
take <10 for the <26 of itself. Sufficient is the day unto the
evil thereof.

3 Nephi Chapter 14

14:1 And now it came to pass that when <353 had <353 <61 <335 he
turned again to the multitude, and did open his mouth unto them again,
saying: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Judge not, that ye be not
judged.

14:2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye <84 be judged; and with what
measure ye mete, it <11 be measured to you again.

14:3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but
considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

14:4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me pull the mote out of
<23 eye—and <439 a beam is in <7 own eye?

14:5 Thou hypocrite, <197 cast the beam out of <15 own eye; and then
shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy <73 eye.

14:6 Give not that <304 is holy unto the dogs, <353 cast ye your
pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn
<176 and rend you.

14:7 Ask, and it <137 be given unto you; seek, and ye <8 find;
knock, and it <6 be opened unto you.

14:8 For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh,
findeth; and to him that knocketh, it <27 be opened.

14:9 Or what man is there of you, who, if his son ask bread, will give
him a stone?

14:10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

14:11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
children, how much more <64 your <389 who is in heaven give good
<341 to them that ask him?

14:12 Therefore, all <12 whatsoever ye would that men should do to
you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets.

14:13 Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad
is the way, <209 leadeth to destruction, and many <128 be who go in
thereat;

14:14 Because <31 is the <28 and narrow is the way, <27 <27
unto life, and few <28 be that find it.

14:15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing,
but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

14:16 Ye <135 know them by <260 fruits. Do men gather grapes of
thorns, or figs of thistles?

14:17 Even so <239 good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt
tree <9 <9 evil fruit.

14:18 A good tree cannot bring <12 evil fruit, <320 a <21 tree
<9 <9 good <21

14:19 Every tree that <32 not <12 good fruit is hewn down, and
cast into the fire.

14:20 Wherefore, by <83 fruits ye <90 know them.

14:21 Not <75 one that saith unto me, Lord, <1 <16 enter into
the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my <255 who is
in heaven.

14:22 Many will say to me in that day: <35 <1 have we not
prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in
thy name done many wonderful works?

14:23 And then will I profess unto them: I never knew you; depart from
me, ye that work iniquity.

14:24 <309 whoso heareth these sayings of mine and <85 <300 I
will liken him unto a wise man, who built his house upon a rock—

14:25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew,
and beat upon that house; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a
rock.

14:26 And <161 one that <66 <66 <66 of mine and <66 them
not <166 be likened unto a foolish man, who <66 his <66 upon the
sand—

14:27 And the rain <67 and the <67 <67 and the <67 <67
and beat upon that <67 and it fell, and great was the fall of it.

3 Nephi Chapter 15

15:1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ended <78 <78 he
cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and said unto <179 Behold,
ye have heard the <476 <403 I taught before I ascended to my Father;
therefore, <180 remembereth <36 <36 of mine and <114 <180 him
will I raise up at the last day.

15:2 And it came to pass that when <67 had said <31 words he
perceived that <446 were some among them who marveled, and wondered
what he would concerning the law of Moses; for they understood not the
saying that old <78 had passed away, and that all <7 had become
new.

15:3 And he said unto <105 Marvel not that I said unto you that old
<24 had <31 <31 and that all <7 had <31 new.

15:4 <130 I say unto you that the law is fulfilled that was given
unto Moses.

15:5 <20 I am he that gave the law, and I am he who covenanted with
my people Israel; <152 the law in me is fulfilled, for I have
come to fulfil the law; therefore it hath an end.

15:6 <44 I do not destroy the prophets, for as many as have not
been <70 in me, verily I say unto you, <302 all be fulfilled.

15:7 And because I said unto you that old <111 have <118 <118 I do
not <43 that <236 hath been spoken <177 <15 <6 are to
come.

15:8 For behold, the covenant <13 I have made with my <101 is not
all fulfilled; but the law <15 was <137 unto Moses hath an end in
me.

15:9 <98 I am the law, and the light. Look unto me, and endure to
the end, and ye <94 live; for unto him that endureth to the end will
I give eternal life.

15:10 <39 I have <55 unto you the commandments; <154 keep my
commandments. And this is the law and the <151 for they truly
testified of me.

15:11 And now it came to pass that when <323 had <127 <323 words,
he said unto those twelve whom he had chosen:

15:12 Ye are my disciples; and ye are a light unto this people, who are
a remnant of the <484 of Joseph.

15:13 And <158 this is the land of your inheritance; and the Father
hath <96 it unto you.

15:14 And not at any time hath the <18 <16 me commandment that I
should tell it unto your brethren at Jerusalem.

15:15 Neither at any time hath the <25 <25 me <25 that I
<25 tell unto them <234 the other tribes of the <78 of
Israel, whom the <23 hath led away out of the land.

15:16 This much did the <16 command me, that I <37 tell unto
<414

15:17 That <41 sheep I have <251 are not of this fold; them also I
must bring, and they <231 hear my voice; and <490 <6 be one fold,
and one shepherd.

15:18 And now, <336 of stiffneckedness and unbelief they <491
not my word; <234 I was commanded to say no more of the <74
<104 this thing unto them.

15:19 But, verily, I say unto you that the <19 hath <28 me,
and I tell it unto you, that ye were separated from among them <58
of their iniquity; <52 it is <8 of <7 iniquity that they
know not of you.

15:20 And <49 I say unto you again that the <128 <169 hath the
<55 <42 from them; and it is <36 of <36 <36 that
they know not of <85

15:21 And <468 I say unto you, that ye are they of whom I said: Other
<170 I have <170 are not of this <170 them also I must <169 and
they <164 hear my <170 and <170 <6 be one <170 and one
<170

15:22 And they <164 me not, for they supposed it had been the
Gentiles; for they <14 not that the Gentiles <237 be converted
through <90 preaching.

15:23 And they <18 me not that I said they <53 hear my <59
and they <14 me not that the <33 <33 not at any time
hear my voice—that I <10 not manifest myself unto them save it were
by the Holy Ghost.

15:24 But <396 ye have both heard my voice, and seen me; and ye are
my sheep, and ye are numbered <215 <454 whom the <180 hath <368
me.

3 Nephi Chapter 16

16:1 And <210 <1 I say unto you that I have <211 <169 <167
are not of this land, neither of the land of Jerusalem, <6 in any
parts of that land round about whither I have been to minister.

16:2 For they of whom I speak are they who have not as yet <94 my
<140 <37 have I at any time manifested <125 unto <250

16:3 But I have received a <461 of the <100 that I <169 go
unto them, and that they <8 hear my <132 and <5 be <123
<124 my <131 that <244 may be one fold and one shepherd; <344
I go to show <53 unto <53

16:4 And I <474 you that ye <35 write these sayings after I am
gone, that if it so be that my people at <129 they who have seen
me and been with me in my ministry, do not ask the <87 in my name,
that they may receive a knowledge of you by the Holy Ghost, and also of
the <183 <394 whom they know not of, that <64 <64 <191 ye
<71 <71 <2 be kept and <4 be <146 unto the Gentiles,
that <318 the fulness of the <8 the remnant of <326 seed,
who <21 be scattered forth upon the face of the earth <432 of
<17 unbelief, may be brought in, or may be <5 to a <77 of
me, <16 Redeemer.

16:5 And then will I gather them in from the four quarters of the
earth; and then will I fulfill the covenant <87 the <121 hath made
unto all the <148 of the house of Israel.

16:6 And blessed are the <88 <71 of <54 belief in me, in
and of the Holy <139 <37 witnesses unto them of me and of the
Father.

16:7 Behold, <29 of <29 <29 in me, saith the Father, and
<11 of the unbelief of you, O <59 of Israel, in the latter day
<136 the truth come unto the <62 that the <156 of <179
things <14 be made known unto <264

16:8 But wo, <46 the <46 unto the unbelieving of the Gentiles—for
notwithstanding they have come <173 upon the face of this <397 and
have <184 my <122 who are of the <65 of Israel; and my <10
who are of the <11 of Israel have been cast out from <341 <355 and
have been trodden under feet by them;

16:9 And <107 of the mercies of the <175 unto the <95 and
also the judgments of the <11 upon my <50 who are of the <49 of
<126 <488 <1 I say unto you, that <358 all this, and I have
caused my <25 who are of the <25 of <74 to be smitten, and to
be afflicted, and to be slain, and to be cast out from <87 <87 and
to become hated by <7 and to <6 a hiss and a byword <17 them—

16:10 And thus commandeth the <81 that I should say unto you: At
that day when the Gentiles <190 sin against my gospel, and <6
reject the <205 of my <9 and <9 be lifted up in the pride of
<252 hearts above all nations, and <4 all the <100 of the whole
earth, and <25 be filled with all manner of lyings, and of deceits,
and of mischiefs, and all <12 of hypocrisy, and murders, and
priestcrafts, and whoredoms, and of secret abominations; and if they
<35 do all those things, and <6 <74 the <74 of my <74
behold, <268 the <268 I will bring the <13 of my gospel from
<127 <289

16:11 And then will I remember my <399 <362 I have made unto my
people, O <187 of <211 and I will <36 my <33 unto <31

16:12 And I will show unto thee, O <22 of <22 that the <153
<73 not have power over you; but I will <50 my <50 unto
you, O <23 of <23 and ye <21 come unto the <494 of the
<86 of my gospel.

16:13 But if the <42 will repent and return unto me, <111 the
<112 behold they <32 be numbered <107 my <89 O <44 of
<486

16:14 And I will not suffer my <16 who are of the <19 of <63
to go through <30 <274 and tread them down, <45 the <484

16:15 But if they will not turn unto me, and hearken unto my voice, I
will <43 <29 yea, I will <5 my <48 O <45 of <45 that
they <77 go <47 <47 <18 and <6 <48 them <48 and they
<7 be as salt that hath lost its savor, <190 is thenceforth good
for nothing but to be cast out, and to be <443 <443 foot of my
<51 O <51 of <114

16:16 Verily, <419 I say unto you, thus hath the <359 commanded
me—that I <361 give unto this <321 this land for <334 inheritance.

16:17 And then the words of the prophet Isaiah <75 be fulfilled,
<70 say:

16:18 Thy watchmen <12 lift up the voice; with the voice together
<10 they sing, for they <5 see eye to eye when the Lord <8
<278 again Zion.

16:19 Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of
Jerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted his <107 he hath redeemed
Jerusalem.

16:20 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eye of all the
nations; and all the ends of the earth <60 see the salvation of God.

3 Nephi Chapter 17

17:1 Behold, now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these <129
he looked round about <92 on the multitude, and he said unto them:
<28 my time is at hand.

17:2 I perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot understand all my
<39 <160 I am <193 of the <197 to speak unto you at this
time.

17:3 Therefore, go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things <30
I have said, and ask of the <371 in my name, that ye may understand,
and prepare your minds for the morrow, and I come unto you again.

17:4 But now I go unto the <32 and also to show myself unto the
lost tribes of <339 for they are not lost unto the <20 for he
knoweth whither he hath taken <501

17:5 And it came to pass that when <156 had thus spoken, he cast his
eyes <157 <157 <157 on the <157 and beheld they were in tears,
and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry a
little longer with <53

17:6 And he said unto <188 <187 my bowels are filled with
compassion towards you.

17:7 Have ye any that are sick <432 you? Bring them hither. Have ye
any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that
are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner?
<35 them hither and I will heal <475 for I have <61 upon you;
my <71 are <71 with mercy.

17:8 For I <260 that ye desire that I <439 show unto you what I
have done unto your brethren at Jerusalem, for I see that your faith is
sufficient that I <25 heal you.

17:9 And it came to pass that when he had thus <180 all the
<173 with one accord, did go <424 with <485 sick and <3
afflicted, and <4 <121 and with <4 <123 and with <4 dumb,
and with all them that were <116 in any manner; and he did heal
them every one as they were brought <42 unto him.

17:10 And they did all, both they who had been healed and they who were
whole, bow down at his feet, and did worship him; and as many as could
come for the multitude did kiss his <18 insomuch that they did bathe
his feet with <80 tears.

17:11 And it came to pass that he <412 that <15 <268 children
<143 be brought.

17:12 So they <84 <14 <14 <14 and set them down upon the
ground <321 <321 him, and <334 stood in the midst; and the <65
gave way till they had all been <32 unto him.

17:13 And it came to pass that when they had all been brought, and
<37 <37 in the midst, he <74 the <38 that they <73
kneel down upon the ground.

17:14 And it came to pass that when they had knelt upon the ground,
<36 groaned within himself, and said: <434 I am troubled because
of the wickedness of the people of the house of Israel.

17:15 And when he had said these words, he himself also <42 upon the
earth; and behold he prayed unto the <42 and the things which he
<10 cannot be written, and the <89 did bear record who heard
him.

17:16 And after this manner do they bear record: The eye hath never
seen, neither hath the ear heard, before, so great and marvelous <46
as we saw and <37 <104 speak unto the Father;

17:17 And no tongue can speak, <31 can there be written by any man,
<9 can the hearts of men conceive so <41 and <41 <41 as
we both saw and <42 <42 speak; and no one can <19 of the joy
<105 <439 our souls at the time we <20 him pray for us unto the
Father.

17:18 And it came to pass that when <39 had made an end of praying
unto the <147 he arose; but so <65 was the joy of the <145
that they were overcome.

17:19 And it came to pass that <37 spake unto them, and bade them
arise.

17:20 And they arose from the earth, and he said unto them: Blessed are
ye <240 of your faith. And now behold, my joy is full.

17:21 And when he had said <238 <238 he wept, and the <70 bare
<215 of it, and he took <373 <373 children, one by one, and
blessed <69 and <241 unto the Father for them.

17:22 And when he had done this he wept again;

17:23 And he <98 unto the multitude, and said unto <83 Behold your
<46 ones.

17:24 And as they looked to <300 they cast <61 eyes towards heaven,
and they saw the heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of
heaven as it were in the midst of fire; and they came down and
encircled those <50 ones about, and they were <8 <465 with
<19 and the <35 did minister unto <98

17:25 And the <130 did see and hear and bear record; and they know
that <73 <141 is true for they all of them did see and hear, every
man for himself; and they were in number <53 two thousand and five
hundred souls; and they did consist of men, women, and children.

3 Nephi Chapter 18

18:1 And it came to pass that <254 <507 his disciples that they
<508 bring forth some bread and wine unto him.

18:2 And while they were gone for <15 and wine, he <29 the
<103 that they <29 sit themselves down upon the earth.

18:3 And when the <47 had come with <28 and <28 he took of
the <8 and brake and <249 it; and he gave unto the <23 and
<46 that they <43 eat.

18:4 And when they had eaten and were filled, he <18 that they
<19 give unto the multitude.

18:5 And when the <77 had <23 and were <23 he said unto the
disciples: <269 <479 shall one be ordained among you, and to him
will I give power that he <16 break <80 and bless it and give it
unto the people of my church, unto all <253 who <20 believe and be
baptized in my name.

18:6 And this <15 ye always observe to do, even as I have done, even
as I have broken <50 and <128 it and given it unto you.

18:7 And this <32 ye do in remembrance of my body, which I have shown
unto you. And it <17 be a testimony unto the <407 that ye do <57
remember me. And if ye do <8 <7 me ye <22 have my Spirit to
be with you.

18:8 And it came to pass that when he said <474 <474 he <177
his <201 that they <179 take of the wine of the cup and drink of
it, and that they <16 also give unto the <188 that they might
<17 of it.

18:9 And it came to pass that they did so, and did <18 of it and were
filled; and they gave unto the <485 and they did drink, and they
were filled.

18:10 And when the <76 had done this, <354 said unto <505
Blessed are ye for this thing <150 ye have <183 for this is
fulfilling my commandments, and this doth witness unto the <152 that
ye are willing to do that <26 I have <123 you.

18:11 And this <156 ye <162 do to <249 who repent and are <247
in my name; and ye <17 do it in <212 of my blood, <36 I have
shed for you, that ye may <58 unto the <58 that ye do <40
<203 me. And if ye do <8 <7 me ye <37 have my <210 to
be with you.

18:12 And I give unto you a commandment that ye <22 do <212 things.
And if ye <8 <35 do <9 things <297 are ye, for ye are built
upon my rock.

18:13 But whoso <380 you <24 do more or less than <27 are not
<23 upon my rock, but are <6 upon a sandy foundation; and when the
rain descends, and the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon
them, they <41 fall, and the gates of hell are ready open to receive
them.

18:14 Therefore <79 are ye if ye <24 keep my <203 <152
the <142 hath <190 me that I <295 give unto you.

18:15 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always,
lest ye be tempted by the devil, and ye be led away captive by him.

18:16 And as I have prayed <125 you even so <62 ye pray in my
<488 <11 my <494 who do <240 and are <240 in my <487
Behold I am the light; I have set an example for you.

18:17 And it came to pass that when <326 had spoken <167 words unto
his disciples, he turned again unto the <396 and said unto <341

18:18 Behold, <107 <1 I say unto you, ye must <108 and pray
<229 lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to have you,
that he may sift you as wheat.

18:19 <171 ye must <27 pray unto the <165 in my <334

18:20 And whatsoever ye <121 ask the <14 in my name, <186 is
right, believing that ye <14 receive, behold it <4 be given unto
you.

18:21 Pray in your families unto the Father, <50 in my <32 that
your wives and your children may be blessed.

18:22 And behold, ye <38 meet together oft; and ye <6 not forbid
any man from coming unto you when ye <12 meet together, but suffer
them that they may come unto you and <24 them not;

18:23 But ye <23 pray for <309 and <5 not cast them out; and if
it so be that they come unto you oft ye <18 pray for them unto the
<93 in my <233

18:24 Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world.
<249 I am the <13 <146 ye <35 hold up—that <5 ye have seen me
do. <17 ye see that I have <297 unto the <47 and ye all have
witnessed.

18:25 And ye see that I have <365 that none of you <366 go away,
but rather have <12 that ye <10 come unto me, that ye might
feel and see; even so <64 ye do unto the world; and whosoever
breaketh this commandment suffereth himself to be led into temptation.

18:26 And now it came to pass that when <328 had <328 <328 words,
he <325 his eyes <327 upon the disciples whom he had chosen, and
said unto <332

18:27 <112 <331 <1 I say unto you, I give unto you another
commandment, and then I must go unto my <295 that I may fulfil other
commandments <148 he hath <289 me.

18:28 And now <263 this is the <91 <16 I give unto you,
that ye <111 not <254 any one knowingly to partake of my flesh and
blood unworthily, when ye <17 minister it;

18:29 For whoso eateth and drinketh my <20 and <19 unworthily
<9 and <9 damnation to his soul; therefore if ye know that a
man is unworthy to eat and drink of my <28 and <28 ye <45 <305
him.

18:30 Nevertheless, ye <10 not cast him out from among you, but ye
<11 <66 unto him and <5 pray for him unto the <250 in my
<436 and if it so be that he repenteth and is baptized in my <404
then <27 ye receive him, and <5 <37 unto him of my <68 and
blood.

18:31 But if he repent not he <20 not be numbered <66 my people,
that he may not destroy my <8 for <470 I know my sheep, and they
are numbered.

18:32 <100 ye <32 not cast him out of your synagogues, or
your places of worship, for unto such <17 ye continue to minister;
for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me
with full purpose of heart, and I <29 heal them; and ye <5 be the
means of bringing salvation unto them.

18:33 <432 keep <316 sayings <249 I have <371 you that ye
come not under condemnation; for wo unto him whom the <291
condemneth.

18:34 And I give you <31 <296 because of the disputations
<36 have been <136 you. And blessed are ye if ye have no
<16 <12 you.

18:35 And now I go unto the <210 <33 it is expedient that I
<436 go unto the <57 for your sakes.

18:36 And it came to pass that when <411 had made an end of <67
sayings, he touched with his hand the <413 whom he had <413 one
by one, even until he had <18 them all, and spake unto them as he
<10 <138

18:37 And the multitude heard not the words <105 he spake, <343
they did not bear record; but the <48 bare record that he gave
them power to give the Holy Ghost. And I will show unto you hereafter
that this <22 is true.

18:38 And it came to pass that when <101 had <65 them all, there
came a cloud and overshadowed the <68 that they could not see
Jesus.

18:39 And while they were <18 he departed from them, and
ascended into heaven. And the <79 saw and did bear <60 that he
<14 again into <15

3 Nephi Chapter 19

19:1 And now it came to pass that when <73 had <25 into heaven,
the <67 did disperse, and every man did take his wife and his
children and did <325 to his own home.

19:2 And it was noised abroad <250 the people immediately, before it
was yet dark, that the <42 had seen Jesus, and that he had
ministered unto <100 and that he would also show himself on the morrow
unto the multitude.

19:3 Yea, and even all the night it was <52 <52 concerning Jesus;
and insomuch did they send forth unto the <61 that <170 were many,
yea, an exceedingly great number, did labor <5 all that night,
that they might be on the <54 in the place where <129 <323 show
<66 unto the <62

19:4 And it came to pass that on the morrow, when the <103 was
gathered together, behold, <173 and his brother whom he had raised
from the dead, whose name was Timothy, and also his son, <8 name was
Jonas, and also Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his brother, and Kumen, and
Kumenonhi, and Jeremiah, and Shemnon, and <18 and Zedekiah, and
Isaiah—now <374 were the names of the <244 whom <85 had
chosen—and it came to pass that they went <128 and stood in the midst
of the <98

19:5 And <83 the <90 was so <136 that they did cause that
they <123 be separated into twelve bodies.

19:6 And the <8 did teach the multitude; and <31 they did <25
that the <36 <26 kneel down upon the face of the earth, and
<11 pray unto the <483 in the name of <352

19:7 And the <94 did pray unto the <17 also in the name of
<19 And it came to pass that they arose and <270 unto the
people.

19:8 And when they had <13 those same <468 <468 <132 had
spoken—nothing varying from the <9 <9 <9 had spoken—behold,
they knelt <383 and prayed to the <55 in the name of <53

19:9 And they did pray for that <28 they most desired; and they
desired that the Holy Ghost <104 be given unto them.

19:10 And when they had thus <45 they went down unto the water’s
edge, and the <141 followed <23

19:11 And it came to pass that <274 went down into the water and was
baptized.

19:12 And he came up out of the <16 and began to baptize. And he
baptized all <121 whom <110 had chosen.

19:13 And it came to pass when they were all <20 and had come up
out of the water, the Holy <100 did fall upon <437 and they were
filled with the Holy <13 and with fire.

19:14 And <244 they were encircled about as if it were by fire; and
it came down from heaven, and the <116 did witness it, and did
bear record; and angels did come down out of heaven and did minister
unto <136

19:15 And it came to pass that while the <25 were ministering unto
the disciples, <62 <113 came and <354 in the <354 and <245
unto <32

19:16 And it came to pass that he spake unto the multitude, and
commanded them that they <217 <332 down <253 upon the <330 and
also that his <317 <13 <13 down upon the earth.

19:17 And it came to pass that when they had all <284 down upon the
<32 he <44 his <30 that they <32 pray.

19:18 And <86 they <210 to pray; and they did pray unto Jesus,
calling him their Lord and <3 God.

19:19 And it came to pass that <114 departed out of the <113 of <202
and went a little way off from them and bowed himself to the <65 and
he said:

19:20 Father, I thank thee that thou hast <334 the Holy <227 unto
these whom I have chosen; and it is because of <66 belief in me that
I have chosen them out of the world.

19:21 <41 I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy <41 unto all
them that shall believe in <37 words.

19:22 <25 thou hast <62 them the Holy <22 <53 they <18
in me; and thou seest that they <9 in me <14 thou hearest
<116 and they pray unto me; and they pray unto me <15 I am with
<242

19:23 And now <49 I pray unto thee for <29 and also for all <386
who <72 <45 on <72 words, that they may <7 in me, that I
may be in them as thou, <34 art in me, that we may be one.

19:24 And it came to pass that when <200 had thus <487 unto the
<27 he came unto his <328 and <243 they did still
continue, without ceasing, to pray unto him; and they did not multiply
many <69 for it was <137 unto them what they <278 pray, and they
were <438 with desire.

19:25 And it came to pass that <61 blessed them as they did pray unto
him; and his countenance did smile upon <125 and the light of his
<11 did shine upon <11 and behold they were as white as the
<14 and also the garments of Jesus; and <16 the whiteness
thereof did exceed all the whiteness, yea, even there could be nothing
upon earth so <32 as the <21 thereof.

19:26 And <75 said unto them: Pray on; nevertheless they did not
cease to <384

19:27 And he turned from them again, and went a <351 way off and
<350 <350 to the earth; and he <172 <454 unto the <172
saying:

19:28 <7 I <355 thee that thou hast purified <237 whom I have
chosen, <266 of <239 faith, and I pray for <120 and also for them
who <255 <248 on <16 <186 that they may be <31 in me,
through faith on <13 <13 even as they are <13 in me.

19:29 <58 I pray not for the world, but for <59 whom thou hast
<221 me out of the <13 <64 of <35 <64 that they may be
<36 in me, that I may be in them as <304 <40 art in me, that
we may be one, that I may be glorified in <361

19:30 And when <171 had spoken <466 words he came <138 unto his
disciples; and <214 they did pray steadfastly, <305 <305 unto
him; and he did <258 upon them again; and <18 they were white, even
as Jesus.

19:31 And it came to pass that he went <44 a <197 way off and
<190 unto the Father;

19:32 And tongue cannot speak the <67 which he prayed, neither can be
written by man the <12 <12 he prayed.

19:33 And the multitude did hear and do bear record; and <142 hearts
were open and they did understand in <10 <10 the <31 <31 he
<32

19:34 Nevertheless, so great and marvelous were the <16 <16 he
<76 that they <69 be written, <65 can they be uttered by man.

19:35 And it came to pass that when <158 had made an end of praying he
came <117 to the <466 and said unto <343 So <52 <256 have I
never seen among all the Jews; wherefore I <378 not show unto them so
<20 miracles, <242 of <90 unbelief.

19:36 Verily I say unto you, <401 are none of them that have seen so
<25 things as ye have seen; <88 have they heard so <11 <11
as ye have heard.

3 Nephi Chapter 20

20:1 And it came to pass that he commanded the <167 that they
should <425 to pray, and also his disciples. And he <16 them
that they <15 not <16 to pray in <84 hearts.

20:2 And he <19 them that they <18 arise and stand up upon
<19 feet. And they arose up and stood upon <9 <9

20:3 And it came to pass that he brake bread <160 and blessed it, and
gave to the disciples to eat.

20:4 And when they had eaten he <57 them that they <57 break
bread, and give unto the multitude.

20:5 And when they had <420 unto the <114 he also gave them wine
to drink, and <34 them that they <34 give unto the <30

20:6 Now, <186 had been no <45 <175 wine, brought by the
<238 <7 by the multitude;

20:7 But he truly gave unto them <97 to eat, and also wine to drink.

20:8 And he said unto <265 He that eateth this <21 <3 of my body
to his soul; and he that drinketh of this wine <4 of my blood to
his <15 and his soul shall <291 hunger nor thirst, but <6 be
filled.

20:9 Now, when the <115 had all <144 and drunk, behold, they were
filled with the Spirit; and they did cry out with one voice, and gave
glory to Jesus, whom they both saw and <283

20:10 And it came to pass that when they had all <166 <24 unto
<25 he said unto <105 Behold now I finish the commandment <421 the
Father hath <173 me concerning this people, who are a remnant of
the house of Israel.

20:11 Ye remember that I spake unto you, and said that when the <458
of Isaiah <204 be fulfilled—behold they are <458 ye have them
before you, therefore search them—

20:12 And verily, <1 I say unto you, that when they <143 be
fulfilled then is the fulfilling of the covenant <80 the <79 hath
made unto his <79 O <73 of <73

20:13 And then <30 the remnants, <22 <4 be scattered abroad upon
the face of the earth, be gathered in from the east and from the west,
and from the south and from the north; and they <32 be <284 to the
knowledge of the Lord <384 God, who hath redeemed them.

20:14 And the <75 hath <154 me that I <123 give unto you this
land, for your inheritance.

20:15 And I say unto you, that if the Gentiles do not repent after the
blessing <91 they <60 receive, <8 they have <95 my people—

20:16 Then <13 ye, who are a <200 of the <126 of Jacob, go forth
among them; and ye <18 be in the midst of them who <8 be many; and
ye <6 be <20 them as a lion <5 the beasts of the forest, and as
a young lion <12 the flocks of sheep, who, if he goeth through both
treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.

20:17 Thy hand <47 be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all <4
enemies <12 be cut off.

20:18 And I will gather my people together as a man gathereth his
sheaves into the floor.

20:19 For I will make my <21 with whom the <180 hath covenanted,
yea, I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass. And
thou shalt beat in pieces many people; and I will consecrate <223 gain
unto the Lord, and <7 substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.
And <443 I am he who doeth it.

20:20 And it <100 come to pass, saith the Father, that the sword of my
justice <14 hang over them at that day; and except they <235 it
<13 fall upon them, <27 the <27 yea, even upon all the nations
of the Gentiles.

20:21 And it <23 come to pass that I will establish my <370 O
<245 of <371

20:22 And <83 this <138 will I <18 in this <308 unto the
<405 of the <405 <292 I made with your father Jacob; and it
<46 be a New Jerusalem. And the powers of heaven <10 be in the
<280 of this <150 yea, even I will be in the <11 of you.

20:23 Behold, I am he of whom Moses spake, saying: A prophet <34 the
Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him
<18 ye hear in all things whatsoever he <8 say unto you. And it
<7 come to pass that every soul who will not hear that <46 <13
be cut off from <332 the people.

20:24 Verily I say unto you, yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and
those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have testified of me.

20:25 And <161 ye are the children of the prophets; and ye are of
the <183 of Israel; and ye are of the <168 <168 the <318 made
with your fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed <83 all the
kindreds of the earth be blessed.

20:26 The <28 having raised me up unto you first, and sent me to
bless you in turning away <124 one of you from his iniquities; and
this because ye are the <81 of the covenant—

20:27 And after that ye were blessed then fulfilleth the <49 the
<83 <83 he made with Abraham, <205 In thy seed <77 all the
<77 of the <77 be blessed—unto the pouring out of the Holy Ghost
<495 me upon the Gentiles, <32 blessing upon the Gentiles <28
make them mighty above all, unto the scattering of my <327 O <143
of <327

20:28 And they <24 be a scourge unto the <332 of this land.
Nevertheless, when they <14 have received the fulness of my gospel,
then if they <12 harden <450 hearts against me I will return <7
iniquities upon <4 own heads, <409 the Father.

20:29 And I will remember the <116 <84 I have made with my
<346 and I have covenanted with them that I would gather them
together in mine own due time, that I <12 give unto them again the
land of <53 fathers for <3 inheritance, <42 is the land of
Jerusalem, <7 is the promised land unto them forever, <70 the
<71

20:30 And it <96 come to pass that the time cometh, when the <114
of my gospel <15 be preached unto them;

20:31 And they <11 believe in me, that I am Jesus Christ, the Son of
God, and <15 pray unto the <232 in my name.

20:32 Then <13 <82 watchmen lift up <4 voice, and with the voice
<113 <13 they sing; for they <5 see eye to eye.

20:33 Then will the <39 <135 them <21 again, and give unto
them Jerusalem for the land of <40 inheritance.

20:34 Then <34 they break forth into joy—Sing together, ye waste
places of Jerusalem; for the <37 hath comforted his <259 he hath
redeemed Jerusalem.

20:35 The <15 hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
nations; and all the ends of the <324 <52 see the salvation of the
Father; and the <32 and I are one.

20:36 And then <21 be brought to pass that <203 is written: Awake,
awake <103 and put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful
garments, O <225 the holy city, for henceforth there <34 no
more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.

20:37 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O <120 loose
<11 from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.

20:38 For thus <269 the Lord: Ye have sold yourselves for naught, and
ye <58 be <144 without money.

20:39 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that my <404 <18 know my
name; yea, in that day they <10 know that I am he that doth speak.

20:40 And then <15 they say: How <116 upon the mountains are the
feet of him that bringeth good tidings unto them, that publisheth
peace; that <10 good <10 unto them of good, that <12
salvation; that <92 unto Zion: Thy God reigneth!

20:41 And then <49 a cry go forth: Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out
from thence, touch not that <196 is unclean; go ye out of the midst of
her; be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.

20:42 For ye <46 not go out with haste nor go by flight; for the Lord
will go before you, and the God of Israel <23 be your rearward.

20:43 Behold, my servant <11 deal prudently; he <4 be exalted and
extolled and be very high.

20:44 As many were astonished at thee—his visage was so marred, more
than any man, and his form more than the sons of men—

20:45 So <43 he sprinkle many <344 the kings <7 shut <400
mouths at him, for that <125 had not been told them <15 they see;
and that <12 they had not heard <11 they consider.

20:46 <250 <250 I say unto you, all these things <16 surely
come, even as the <378 hath commanded me. Then <12 this covenant
<37 the <11 hath covenanted with his <274 be fulfilled; and then
<17 <475 be inhabited again with my <450 and it <10 be the
land of <85 <485

3 Nephi Chapter 21

21:1 And verily I say unto you, I give unto you a sign, that ye may
know the time when <80 <80 <41 be about to take place—that I
<8 gather in, from <47 long dispersion, my <60 O house of
Israel, and <15 establish <72 among them my <450

21:2 And behold, this is the thing <104 I will give unto you for a
sign—for <71 I say unto you that when <59 <59 <19 I declare
unto you, and <7 I <45 <8 unto you hereafter of myself, and
by the power of the Holy Ghost <18 <17 be given unto you of the
Father, <9 be made known unto the Gentiles that they may know
concerning this <165 who are a remnant of the <97 of Jacob, and
<14 this my <15 who <31 be scattered by them;

21:3 <223 <223 I say unto you, when <84 <84 <18 be made
<50 unto them of the <59 and <11 come forth of the <7 from
them unto you;

21:4 For it is wisdom in the <237 that they should be established in
this land, and be set up as a free <69 by the <116 of the <39
that <60 <60 might come <49 from them unto a <98 of your
seed, that the <283 of the <45 may be fulfilled <140 he hath
<288 with his <215 O <118 of Israel;

21:5 Therefore, when <41 works and the <3 <23 <94 be wrought
<226 you <182 <7 come <52 from the Gentiles, unto your seed
<18 <11 dwindle in unbelief because of iniquity;

21:6 For thus it behooveth the <62 that it <107 come <30 from
the <31 that he may show <9 his <103 unto the <10 for
this cause that the <7 if they will not harden <302 hearts,
that they may repent and come unto me and be baptized in my name and
know of the true points of my doctrine, that they may be numbered <94
my <118 O <118 of <118

21:7 And when <118 <159 come to pass that thy seed <102 begin to
know <13 things—it <7 be a sign unto them, that they may know that
the work of the <109 hath already commenced unto the fulfilling of
the <184 <137 he hath made unto the <216 who are of the <62 of
Israel.

21:8 And when that day <50 <503 it <3 come to pass that kings
<7 shut <123 mouths; for that <39 had not been told them <12
they see; and that <12 they had not heard <11 they consider.

21:9 For in that day, for my sake <14 the <83 work a work, <25
<8 be a great and a marvelous work <142 <360 and there <12 be
<7 them those who will not believe it, although a man <14 <438
it unto them.

21:10 But <482 the life of my servant <17 be in my hand; therefore
they <8 not hurt him, <32 he <6 be marred <270 of <31
Yet I will heal him, for I will show unto them that my <385 is
greater than the cunning of the devil.

21:11 Therefore it <36 come to pass that whosoever will not <80
in my words, who am Jesus Christ, <112 the <118 <20 <289 him to
bring <303 unto the <294 and <11 give unto him <310 that he
<8 <15 them <16 unto the <16 (it <8 be done even as
Moses said) they <9 be cut off from <139 my <228 who are of the
covenant.

21:12 And my <13 who are a <443 of Jacob <27 be <24 the
<43 yea, in the midst of them as a lion <13 the beasts of the
forest, as a young lion <11 the flocks of sheep, who, if he go
through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.

21:13 Their hand <54 be lifted up upon <278 adversaries, and all
<5 enemies <12 be cut off.

21:14 Yea, wo be unto the Gentiles except they repent; for it <19
come to pass in that day, saith the Father, that I will cut off thy
horses out of the <98 of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots;

21:15 And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy
strongholds;

21:16 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy <21 and thou shalt
have no more soothsayers;

21:17 Thy graven images I will also cut off, and thy standing <9
out of the <72 of <72 and thou <31 no more worship the works of
thy hands;

21:18 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the <29 of thee; so will
I <102 thy cities.

21:19 And it <139 come to pass that all lyings, and deceivings, and
envyings, and strifes, and priestcrafts, and whoredoms, <18 be done
away.

21:20 For it <11 come to pass, <164 the <164 that at that day
<343 will not repent and come unto my Beloved Son, them will I cut
off from <256 my people, O house of Israel;

21:21 And I will execute vengeance and fury upon them, even as upon the
heathen, such as they have not heard.

21:22 But if they will <54 and hearken unto my <398 and harden not
<268 hearts, I will establish my church <57 <39 and they <90
come in unto the covenant and be numbered <14 this the <359 of
Jacob, unto whom I have given this land for <36 inheritance;

21:23 And they <33 assist my <95 the <25 of <24 and also
as many of the <105 of Israel as <19 come, that they may build a
city, <470 <10 be called the New Jerusalem.

21:24 And then <12 they <42 my <428 that they may be gathered
in, who are scattered upon all the face of the <288 in unto the New
<34

21:25 And then <34 the <501 of heaven come down <105 them; and I
also will be in the midst.

21:26 And then <24 the work of the Father commence at that day, even
when this gospel <15 be preached <35 the <114 of this people.
Verily I say unto you, at that day <18 the work of the <33
<34 <23 all the dispersed of my <143 yea, even the tribes
<124 have been lost, <4 the <21 hath led away out of <96

21:27 Yea, the work <40 <34 <34 all the <34 of my
<35 with the <26 to prepare the way whereby they may come unto
me, that they may call on the <18 in my name.

21:28 Yea, and then <41 the work commence, with the <17 <46 all
nations in preparing the way <39 his <185 may be <183 home to
the land of <248 inheritance.

21:29 And they <35 go out from all nations; and they <8 not go out
in haste, nor go by flight, for I will go before <308 <392 the
<393 and I will be <41 rearward.

3 Nephi Chapter 22

22:1 And then <40 that <142 is written come to pass: Sing, O barren,
thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou
that <13 not travail with child; for more are the children of the
desolate than the <7 of the married wife, <71 the Lord.

22:2 Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch <47 the
curtains of thy habitations; spare not, lengthen thy cords and
strengthen thy stakes;

22:3 For thou shalt <72 <25 on the right hand and on the left, and
thy seed <103 inherit the Gentiles and make the <70 cities to be
inhabited.

22:4 Fear not, for thou <36 not be ashamed; neither be thou
confounded, for thou <11 not be put to shame; for thou <8 forget
the shame of thy youth, and <9 not remember the reproach of thy
<10 and <10 not <10 the <10 of thy widowhood any more.

22:5 For thy maker, thy husband, the Lord of Hosts is his name; and thy
Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel—the God of the whole earth <99 he be
called.

22:6 For the Lord hath <480 thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in
spirit, and a wife of <70 when thou wast refused, <187 thy God.

22:7 For a small moment have I <28 thee, but with great mercies
will I gather thee.

22:8 In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with
everlasting kindness will I have mercy on <37 <52 the Lord thy
Redeemer.

22:9 For this, the waters of Noah unto me, for as I have sworn that the
<13 of Noah should no more go over the earth, so have I <17 that I
would not be wroth with <77

22:10 For the mountains <141 depart and the hills be removed, but my
<73 <11 not <12 from <72 <231 <6 the covenant of my
peace be <19 <82 the Lord that hath <90 on <41

22:11 O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted! Behold,
I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with
sapphires.

22:12 And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of
carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.

22:13 And all thy <396 <80 be taught of the Lord; and <195 <8
be the <86 of thy children.

22:14 In righteousness <300 thou be established; thou <5 be far
from oppression for thou <8 not fear, and from terror for it <35
not come near <112

22:15 <103 they <12 surely <240 together against <142 not by
me; whosoever <11 <10 <10 <10 thee <5 fall for thy
sake.

22:16 <28 I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the
fire, and that bringeth <448 an instrument for his work; and I have
<24 the waster to destroy.

22:17 No weapon that is formed <53 thee <53 prosper; and every
tongue that <7 revile <11 thee in judgment thou <103 condemn.
This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their
<133 is of me, <229 the Lord.

3 Nephi Chapter 23

23:1 And now, behold, I say unto you, that ye ought to search these
things. Yea, a commandment I give unto you that ye <13 <13 things
diligently; for <195 are the words of Isaiah.

23:2 For <157 he spake as touching all <21 concerning my people
which are of the house of Israel; therefore it must needs be that he
must speak also to the Gentiles.

23:3 And all <32 that he <39 have been and <127 be, even
according to the <60 <42 he spake.

23:4 Therefore give heed to my words; write the <30 <16 I have
told you; and <27 to the time and the will of the Father they
<43 go <205 unto the <62

23:5 And <247 will hearken unto my <52 and repenteth and is
baptized, the same <25 be saved. Search the prophets, for many there
be that testify of <143 <155

23:6 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had said <17 <41 he
said unto them again, after he had expounded all the scriptures unto
them <93 they had received, he said unto them: <302 other
<15 I <498 that ye should write, that ye have not.

23:7 And it came to pass that he said unto Nephi: Bring <109 the
record <41 ye have kept.

23:8 And when <261 had brought <17 the records, and laid them before
him, he cast his eyes upon them and said:

23:9 Verily I say unto you, I commanded my servant Samuel, the
Lamanite, that he <74 <128 unto this people, that at the day that
the <179 <13 glorify his name in me that <151 were many saints
who <13 arise from the dead, and <6 appear unto many, and <5
minister unto them. And he said unto <129 Was it not so?

23:10 And his disciples answered him and <81 Yea, <378 Samuel did
prophesy <244 to thy words, and they were all fulfilled.

23:11 And <193 said unto <39 How be it that ye have not written this
thing, that many <76 did <74 and <70 unto many and did <69
unto them?

23:12 And it came to pass that <161 remembered that this thing had not
been written.

23:13 And it came to pass that <60 <152 that it <109 be
written; <384 it was <60 <86 as he commanded.

23:14 And now it came to pass that when <28 had <269 all the
<255 in one, <228 they had written, he <41 them that they
<43 teach the <376 <14 he had <24 unto <157

3 <81 <503 24

24:1 And it came to pass that he <33 them that they <32 <408
the <332 <33 the <216 had given unto Malachi, <7 he <14 tell
unto <41 And it came to pass that <346 they were <96 he
<56 <14 And <363 are the <33 <26 he did tell unto them,
saying: Thus said the <42 unto Malachi—Behold, I will send my
messenger, and he <420 prepare the way <315 me, and the Lord whom ye
seek <13 suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the
covenant, whom ye delight in; behold, he <19 come, saith the Lord of
Hosts.

24:2 But who may abide the day of his coming, and who <23 stand when
he appeareth? For he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fuller’s soap.

24:3 And he <23 sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he <11
purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they
may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.

24:4 Then <31 the <10 of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto
the <350 as in the days of old, and as in former years.

24:5 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift
witness against the sorcerers, and <4 the adulterers, and <4
false swearers, and <5 those that oppress the hireling in his
wages, the widow and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger,
and fear not me, <170 the Lord of <169

24:6 For I am the <85 I change not; <352 ye sons of Jacob are
not consumed.

24:7 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine
ordinances, and have not kept <281 Return unto me and I will return
unto you, <60 the Lord of <60 But ye say: Wherein <153 we return?

24:8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say: <21
have we <9 thee? In tithes and offerings.

24:9 Ye are cursed with a curse, for ye have <19 me, even this whole
nation.

24:10 Bring ye all the <31 into the storehouse, that there may be
meat in my house; and prove me now herewith, <85 the Lord of Hosts,
if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a
blessing that <37 <101 not be room enough to receive it.

24:11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he <23 not
destroy the fruits of your ground; neither <10 your vine cast her
fruit <410 the time in the fields, <71 the Lord of <156

24:12 And all nations <25 call you blessed, for ye <6 be a
delightsome land, <24 the Lord of <24

24:13 Your <477 have been stout <280 me, <16 the Lord. Yet ye
say: What have we spoken <13 <174

24:14 Ye have said: It is vain to serve God, and what doth it profit
that we have kept his ordinances and that we have walked mournfully
<91 the Lord of Hosts?

24:15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness
are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.

24:16 Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another, and
the Lord hearkened and heard; and a book of remembrance was written
<63 him for them that <28 the <358 and that thought upon his
name.

24:17 And they <151 be mine, <132 the Lord of <243 in that day when
I make up my jewels; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son
that serveth him.

24:18 Then <39 ye <370 and discern between the righteous and the
wicked, <7 him that <22 God and him that <5 him not.

3 Nephi Chapter 25

25:1 For behold, the day cometh that <40 burn as an oven; and all the
proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, <16 be stubble; and the day
that <26 <9 burn them up, <105 the Lord of <105 that it <11
leave them <302 root nor branch.

25:2 But unto you that fear my name, <19 the Son of Righteousness
arise with healing in his wings; and ye <14 go forth and grow up as
calves in the stall.

25:3 And ye <18 tread down the wicked; for they <7 be ashes under
the soles of your feet in the day that I <15 do this, <83 the Lord
of <337

25:4 Remember ye the law of Moses, my servant, which I commanded unto
him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments.

25:5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet <258 the coming of
the great and dreadful day of the Lord;

25:6 And he <68 turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and
the <10 of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the
earth with a curse.

3 <225 <225 26

26:1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had told these things he
expounded them unto the multitude; and he did expound all <13 unto
them, both <85 and small.

26:2 And he saith: These scriptures, <131 ye had not with you, the
Father <138 that I should give unto you; for it was wisdom in him
that they <13 be given unto future generations.

26:3 And he did <57 all things, even from the beginning until the
time that he <26 come in his glory—yea, even all <75 <59 <9
come upon the face of the earth, even <25 the elements <13 melt
with fervent heat, and the <138 <9 be wrapt together as a scroll,
and the heavens and the <14 <14 pass away;

26:4 And even unto the <119 and last day, when all people, and all
kindreds, and all nations and tongues <207 stand <228 God, to be
judged of <198 works, whether they be good or <5 they be evil—

26:5 If they be good, to the resurrection of everlasting life; and if
they be evil, to the <12 of damnation; being on a parallel,
the one on the one hand and the other on the <3 hand, according to
the mercy, and the justice, and the holiness <138 is in Christ, who
was <79 the world began.

26:6 And now there cannot be written in this book even a hundredth part
of the <170 <32 <264 did truly teach unto the people;

26:7 But behold the plates of <295 do contain the more part of the
<27 <27 he taught the people.

26:8 And <297 <12 have I written, <15 are a lesser part of the
<12 <9 he <24 the <48 and I have <71 them to the
intent that they may be brought again unto this <189 from the
Gentiles, <121 to the words <31 <82 hath spoken.

26:9 And when they <199 have received <475 <15 is expedient that
they <236 have first, to try <205 faith, and if it <20 so be that
they <6 believe <84 <72 then <5 the greater <5 be made
manifest unto them.

26:10 And if it so be that they will not <27 <27 <338 then
<28 the <28 <28 be withheld from <402 unto <53
condemnation.

26:11 <508 I was about to write <15 all <79 were engraven upon
the <167 of Nephi, but the Lord forbade it, saying: I will try the
faith of my <168

26:12 Therefore I, Mormon, do <35 the <55 <35 have been
<435 me of the Lord. And now I, <17 make an end of my sayings,
and proceed to <26 the <26 <26 have been <25 me.

26:13 Therefore, I would that ye <148 <239 that the Lord <253 did
<255 the <188 for the space of three days; and after that he did
show himself unto them oft, and did break bread oft, and bless it, and
give it unto <159

26:14 And it came to pass that he did <46 and minister unto the
children of the multitude of whom hath been spoken, and he did loose
<164 tongues, and they did speak unto <7 fathers <456 and
marvelous <189 even <186 than he had revealed unto the <292
and he loosed <20 <460 that they could utter.

26:15 And it came to pass that <99 he had ascended into heaven—the
second time that he showed <105 unto <208 and had gone unto the
Father, <22 having healed all <42 sick, and <3 lame, and opened
the eyes of <8 blind and unstopped the ears of the deaf, and even
had done all manner of cures among <42 and raised a man from the
dead, and had shown forth his power unto <16 and had <72 unto
the Father—

26:16 <284 it came to pass on the morrow that the <148 gathered
themselves together, and they both saw and heard <325 children; yea,
even babes did open <76 mouths and utter <148 things; and the
<254 <254 they did <10 were forbidden that there <248 not any
man <270 <213

26:17 And it came to pass that the disciples whom <436 had chosen
began from that time <91 to baptize and to <227 as many as did come
unto them; and as many as were baptized in the name of <32 were
filled with the Holy Ghost.

26:18 And many of them saw and <97 unspeakable <233 <81 are not
lawful to be written.

26:19 And they taught, and did <282 one to another; and they had
all <108 common <177 <161 every man dealing justly, one with
another.

26:20 And it came to pass that they did do all <26 even as <76 had
<390 <126

26:21 And they who were <94 in the name of <18 were called the
church of Christ.

3 Nephi Chapter 27

27:1 And it came to pass that as the <155 of <29 were journeying
and were preaching the <58 <111 they had both <118 and seen, and
were baptizing in the name of Jesus, it came to pass that the <33
were <245 together and were united in mighty prayer and fasting.

27:2 And <49 again <346 <346 unto <127 for they were praying
unto the Father in his name; and <18 came and stood in the midst of
<22 and said unto them: What will ye that I shall give unto you?

27:3 And they said unto him: Lord, we will that thou wouldst tell us
the name whereby we <26 call this church; for <293 are disputations
<195 the people concerning this matter.

27:4 And the Lord said unto <56 Verily, verily, I say unto you, why
is it that the <26 <325 murmur and dispute because of this thing?

27:5 Have they not read the scriptures, <159 say ye must take upon you
the name of Christ, <12 is my name? For by this name <76 ye be
<219 at the last day;

27:6 And whoso taketh upon him my name, and endureth to the end, the
same <28 be saved at the last day.

27:7 Therefore, whatsoever ye <14 do, ye <3 do it in my <173
therefore ye <9 call the <269 in my <10 and ye <9 call upon
the <194 in my name that he will bless the <20 for my sake.

27:8 And how be it my <13 save it be <90 in my <102 For if a
<12 be <10 in Moses’ name then it be <5 <185 or if it be
<14 in the name of a man then it be the <27 of a man; but if it
be <20 in my name then it is my church, if it so be that they are
built upon my gospel.

27:9 Verily I say unto you, that ye are <16 upon my gospel; <123
ye <115 call <140 <361 ye do call, in my <127 <13 if ye
call upon the Father, for the <52 if it be in my name the <138
will hear you;

27:10 And if it so be that the <93 is <53 upon my gospel then will
the <26 show forth his own works in it.

27:11 But if it be not <25 upon my gospel, and is <6 upon the
<22 of men, or upon the <6 of the devil, verily I say unto you
they have joy in their <15 for a season, and by and by the end
cometh, and they are hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence
<376 is no return.

27:12 For <35 <35 do follow <430 for it is <356 of <10 <10
that they are hewn down; <144 remember the <154 that I have told
you.

27:13 Behold I have given unto you my <101 and this is the <131
<368 I have <14 unto you—that I came into the world to do the will
of my <183 <57 my <149 sent me.

27:14 And my <9 sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross;
and after that I had been <12 up upon the cross, that I <21 draw
all men unto me, that as I have been <19 up by men even so <472
men be <10 up by the <64 to stand before me, to be judged of
<128 works, whether they be good or <5 they be evil—

27:15 And for this cause have I been <36 up; therefore, according to
the power of the <94 I will draw all men unto me, that they may be
<48 <21 to <48 works.

27:16 And it <330 come to pass, that <499 repenteth and is baptized
in my name <14 be filled; and if he <507 to the end, behold, him
will I hold guiltless <94 my <57 at that day when I <25 <104
to judge the world.

27:17 And he that <33 not unto the end, the same is he that is
also hewn down and cast into the <279 from <279 they can no more
return, <210 of the justice of the Father.

27:18 And this is the word <245 he hath <245 unto the children of
men. And for this <148 he fulfilleth the words <18 he hath given,
and he lieth not, but <13 all his words.

27:19 And no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; <318
nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed <164
garments in my blood, <81 of <8 faith, and the repentance of all
<8 sins, and <3 faithfulness unto the end.

27:20 Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth,
and come unto me and be <194 in my name, that ye may be sanctified
by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may <183 spotless <194
me at the last day.

27:21 Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and ye know
the <424 that ye must do in my church; for the <444 <147 ye have
seen me do that <231 ye also do; for that <14 ye have seen me do
even that <15 ye do;

27:22 Therefore, if ye do these <46 blessed are ye, for ye <18 be
<340 up at the last day.

27:23 Write the <21 <43 ye have seen and heard, save it be <176
<11 are forbidden.

27:24 <21 the <78 of this people, <13 <41 be, even as hath been
written, of that <11 hath been.

27:25 For <338 out of the books <13 have been <19 and <5
<30 be <6 <3 this people be judged, for by them <8 <211
<49 be known unto men.

27:26 And <36 all <82 are written by the Father; <264 out
of the <45 <40 <28 be <13 <3 the world be judged.

27:27 And know ye that ye <14 be judges of this <93 <446 to
the judgment <29 I <13 give unto you, <6 <5 be just.
<160 what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you,
even as I am.

27:28 And now I go unto the <394 And verily I say unto you,
whatsoever <90 ye <44 ask the <462 in my name <7 be <401
unto you.

27:29 <57 ask, and ye <14 receive; knock, and it <5 be
opened unto you; for he that asketh, receiveth; and unto him that
knocketh, it <18 be opened.

27:30 And now, <147 my joy is great, even unto fulness, <391 of
you, and also this generation; yea, and even the <70 rejoiceth, and
also all the holy angels, <21 of you and this <19 for none
of them are lost.

27:31 Behold, I would that ye should understand; for I mean them who
are now alive of this <30 and none of them are lost; and in
them I have fulness of joy.

27:32 But <85 it sorroweth me <60 of the fourth generation from
this generation, for they are led away captive by him even as was the
son of perdition; for they will sell me for silver and for gold, and
for that <226 moth doth corrupt and <5 thieves can break through
and steal. And in that day will I visit them, even in turning <311
<311 upon <4 own heads.

27:33 And it came to pass that when Jesus had ended <422 sayings he
said unto his disciples: Enter ye in at the strait gate; for <3 is
the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be
that find it; but wide is the <22 and broad the way <87 <21 to
death, and many <22 be that travel therein, until the night cometh,
wherein no man can work.

3 Nephi Chapter 28

28:1 And it came to pass when <89 had said <89 words, he spake unto
his disciples, one by one, saying unto them: What is it that ye desire
of me, after that I am gone to the Father?

28:2 And they all spake, save it were three, saying: We <26 that
<25 we have lived unto the age of man, that our ministry, <85
thou hast called us, may have an end, that we may speedily come unto
thee in thy kingdom.

28:3 And he said unto <76 Blessed are ye <266 ye desired this
thing of me; therefore, <54 that ye are seventy and two years old ye
<384 come unto me in my kingdom; and with me ye <11 find rest.

28:4 And when he had spoken unto <251 he turned himself unto the
<102 and said unto <59 What will ye that I <365 do unto you, when
I am gone unto the <135

28:5 And they sorrowed in <280 hearts, for they durst not speak unto
him the <502 <228 they desired.

28:6 And he said unto <49 <414 I know your thoughts, and ye have
<112 the <111 <24 John, my beloved, who was with me in my
<162 before that I was lifted up by the Jews, <24 of me.

28:7 Therefore, more blessed are ye, for ye <121 never taste of death;
but ye <8 live to behold all the doings of the <504 unto the
children of men, even <300 all <87 <20 be fulfilled according to
the will of the Father, when I <13 come in my glory with the powers
of heaven.

28:8 And ye <17 <58 endure the pains of <60 but when I <10
come in my <28 ye <7 be changed in the twinkling of an eye from
mortality to immortality; and then <16 ye be <99 in the kingdom
of my Father.

28:9 And again, ye <18 not have pain while ye <6 dwell in the
flesh, neither sorrow save it be for the sins of the world; and all
this will I do <291 of the <178 <178 ye have <160 of me, for ye
have <7 that ye might bring the souls of men unto me, <51 the
world <53 stand.

28:10 And for this cause ye <11 have fulness of joy; and ye <7 sit
down in the <95 of my Father; yea, your joy <13 be full, even as
the <189 hath given me <29 of joy; and ye <16 be even as I am,
and I am even as the <33 and the <25 and I are one;

28:11 And the Holy Ghost beareth record of the <17 and me; and the
<6 giveth the Holy <15 unto the <240 of men, <125 of me.

28:12 And it came to pass that when Jesus had <390 these words, he
touched every one of them with his finger save it were the three who
were to tarry, and then he departed.

28:13 And behold, the heavens were opened, and they were caught up into
heaven, and saw and heard unspeakable things.

28:14 And it was forbidden them that they <433 utter; <223 was it
<140 unto them power that they could utter the <330 <215 they saw
and heard;

28:15 And whether they were in the body or out of the body, they <27
not tell; for it did seem unto them like a transfiguration of <503
that they were <323 from this body of flesh into an immortal state,
that they <32 <403 the <59 of God.

28:16 But it came to pass that they did again minister upon the face of
the earth; nevertheless they did not <12 of the <31 <90 they
had <124 and seen, <191 of the commandment <11 was <113 them in
<414

28:17 And now, <103 they were mortal or immortal, from the day of
their transfiguration, I know not;

28:18 But this much I know, <466 to the <255 <42 hath been
given—they did go forth upon the face of the land, and did <73
unto all the people, uniting as many to the church as would believe in
<51 preaching; baptizing <142 and as many as were baptized did
receive the Holy Ghost.

28:19 And they were cast into prison by them who did not belong to the
church. And the prisons <160 not hold <39 for they were rent in
twain.

28:20 And they were cast down into the <156 but they did smite the
earth with the word of God, insomuch that by his <261 they were
delivered out of the depths of the <28 and therefore they <54 not
dig pits sufficient to hold them.

28:21 And thrice they were cast into a furnace and received no harm.

28:22 And twice were they cast into a den of wild beasts; and <254
they did play with the beasts as a child with a suckling lamb, and
<36 no <36

28:23 And it came to pass that thus they did go <194 among all the
people of Nephi, and did preach the gospel of Christ unto all <12
upon the face of the land; and they were converted unto the Lord, and
were united unto the <212 of Christ, and thus the <27 of that
generation were blessed, <256 to the word of Jesus.

28:24 And now I, Mormon, make an end of speaking concerning <492
<328 for a time.

28:25 Behold, I was about to write the names of those who were never to
taste of death, but the Lord forbade; <180 I <19 them not, for
they are hid from the world.

28:26 But <511 I have seen <251 and they have ministered unto me.

28:27 And <171 they will be <140 the Gentiles, and the Gentiles
shall know them not.

28:28 They will also be <19 the Jews, and the Jews <18 know them
not.

28:29 And it <11 come to pass, when the Lord seeth fit in his wisdom
that they <15 <378 unto all the scattered tribes of Israel, and
unto all nations, kindreds, tongues and <389 and <19 bring out of
them unto Jesus many souls, that <390 desire may be fulfilled, and
also <477 of the convincing <324 of God <438 is in <307

28:30 And they are as the angels of God, and if they <45 pray unto
the Father in the name of <48 they can show themselves unto
whatsoever man it seemeth them good.

28:31 Therefore, great and marvelous works <32 be wrought by <167
before the <12 and coming day when all <258 must surely stand
<13 the judgment-seat of Christ;

28:32 Yea even <158 the <174 <33 there be a <29 and <41
work <40 by <40 <26 that judgment day.

28:33 And if ye had all the scriptures <111 give an account of all the
<29 <70 of <319 ye would, <311 to the words of <8
know that <300 <299 must <70 come.

28:34 And wo be unto him that will not hearken unto the <26 of Jesus,
and also to them whom he hath chosen and sent <87 them; for whoso
receiveth not the <22 of <149 and the <5 of <330 whom he hath
sent <16 not him; and <327 he will not receive them at the
last day;

28:35 And it would be better for them if they had not been born. For do
ye suppose that ye can get rid of the justice of an offended God, who
hath been trampled under feet of men, that thereby salvation might
come?

28:36 And now <375 as I spake <430 <81 whom the Lord hath
chosen, yea, even three who were caught up into the heavens, that I
knew not whether they were cleansed from mortality to immortality—

28:37 But <40 since I wrote, I have inquired of the Lord, and he
hath made it manifest unto me that <234 must needs be a change <232
upon <343 bodies, or else it <12 be that they must <479 of death;

28:38 <299 that they <98 not <12 of death <34 was a <32
<33 upon <32 <32 that they <16 not suffer pain nor sorrow
save it were for the sins of the <501

28:39 Now this <30 was not equal to that <281 <309 take place at
the last day; but <49 was a <19 <48 upon <313 insomuch that
Satan could have no <419 over <10 that he <8 not tempt <255 and
they were sanctified in the flesh, that they were holy, and that the
powers of the earth <24 not hold <445 3 Nephi 28:40 And in this
state they were to remain until the <365 day of <392 and at that
day they were to <278 a greater change, and to be received into the
kingdom of the <465 to go no more out, but to dwell eternally in the
heavens.

3 <57 Chapter 29

29:1 And now <217 I say unto you that when the Lord <132 see fit,
in his wisdom, that <399 sayings <10 come unto the <456
<416 to his word, then ye may know that the covenant <160 the
<66 hath made with the children of Israel, <300 <204
restoration to the lands of <7 inheritance, is already beginning to
be fulfilled.

29:2 And ye may know that the <409 of the <285 <42 have been spoken
by the holy prophets, <68 all be fulfilled; and ye need not say that
the Lord delays his coming unto the <61 of Israel.

29:3 And ye need not imagine in your hearts that the <48 <45 have
been <46 are vain, for <131 the Lord will remember his <102
<16 he hath made unto his people of the house of <43

29:4 And when ye <71 see <143 <143 <60 forth <512 you, then
ye need not any longer spurn at the doings of the <102 for the sword
of his <469 is in his right hand; and <62 at that day, if ye
<42 <28 at his <28 he will cause that it <10 soon overtake
you.

29:5 Wo unto him that spurneth at the <22 of the Lord; yea, wo unto
him that <26 deny the Christ and his works!

29:6 Yea, wo unto him that <16 deny the revelations of the <79 and
that <10 say the Lord no <95 worketh by revelation, or by
prophecy, or by gifts, or by tongues, or by healings, or by the <387
of the Holy Ghost!

29:7 Yea, and wo unto him that <41 say at that day, to get gain, that
<427 can be no miracle <428 by Jesus <371 for he that doeth this
<25 become like unto the son of perdition, for whom <25 was no
mercy, <318 to the word of Christ!

29:8 Yea, and ye need not any <92 hiss, nor spurn, nor make game of
the Jews, nor any of the remnant of the <229 of Israel; for <188
the Lord remembereth his <250 unto <487 and he will do unto them
<54 to that <261 he hath sworn.

29:9 Therefore ye need not suppose that ye can turn the <228 hand of
the Lord unto the left, that he may not execute <485 unto the
fulfilling of the <52 <40 he hath made unto the <69 of <298

3 <462 <462 30

30:1 Hearken, O ye Gentiles, and hear the <345 of <149 Christ, the
Son of the living God, <38 he hath commanded me that I should speak
<441 you, for, behold he commandeth me that I <12 write,
saying:

30:2 Turn, all ye <45 from your wicked ways; and repent of your
evil doings, of your lyings and deceivings, and of your whoredoms, and
of your secret abominations, and your idolatries, and of your murders,
and your priestcrafts, and your envyings, and your strifes, and from
all your wickedness and <25 and come unto me, and be baptized
in my name, that ye may receive a remission of your sins, and be filled
with the Holy Ghost, that ye may be numbered with my <450 who are of
the <155 of <155




 FOURTH NEPHI

WHO IS THE SON OF NEPHI—ONE OF THE DISCIPLES OF JESUS CHRIST

An account of the <43 of Nephi, <244 to his record.

4 <196 1:1 And it came to pass that the thirty and fourth year passed
away, and also the <10 and fifth, and <181 the disciples of <207
had formed a church of <444 in all the lands round about. And as many
as did come unto <309 and did truly <188 of their <126 were
<142 in the name of Jesus; and they did also <144 the Holy
Ghost.

4 <78 1:2 And it came to pass in the <68 and sixth year, the
<104 were all converted unto the <490 upon all the face of the land,
both Nephites and Lamanites, and <424 were no contentions and
disputations among <72 and every man did deal justly one with
another.

4 <58 1:3 And they had all things common <24 them; therefore <34
were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made <6 and
partakers of the heavenly gift.

4 <38 1:4 And it came to pass that the <96 and seventh year <174
away also, and <45 still continued to be peace in the land.

4 <31 1:5 And <16 were great and marvelous works wrought by the
<193 of Jesus, insomuch that they did heal the sick, and raise the
dead, and cause the lame to walk, and the blind to <174 <189 sight,
and the deaf to hear; and all manner of miracles did they work <116
the children of men; and in nothing did they work <16 save it were
in the name of Jesus.

4 <81 1:6 And thus did the <109 and eighth year pass <282 and also
the <10 and ninth, and forty and first, and the <5 and second,
yea, even until <7 and nine years had <136 <27 and also the
fifty and <23 and the <5 and second; yea, and even <23 <7
and nine <24 had <24 away.

4 <67 1:7 And the Lord did prosper them exceedingly in the land; yea,
<146 that they did build cities again where <167 had been <6
burned.

4 <32 1:8 Yea, even that <180 city Zarahemla did they <161 to be
built again.

4 <20 1:9 But <33 were many <33 which had been sunk, and waters
came up in the stead thereof; <279 these <16 could not be
renewed.

4 <32 1:10 And now, behold, it came to pass that the <355 of <13
did wax strong, and did multiply <97 fast, and became an
<6 fair and delightsome people.

4 <23 1:11 And they were married, and given in marriage, and were
blessed <495 to the multitude of the promises <82 the Lord had
made unto them.

4 <33 1:12 And they did not walk any more after the performances and
ordinances of the law of Moses; but they did walk <15 the
commandments <40 they had received from <295 Lord and <3 God,
continuing in fasting and prayer, and in meeting together oft both to
pray and to hear the word of the Lord.

4 <65 1:13 And it came to pass that <171 was no contention <323 all
the people, in all the <227 but <14 were mighty <324 <383
<16 the <383 of <322

4 <37 1:14 And it came to pass that the seventy and first year <274
<299 and also the <10 and second year, yea, and in fine, till the
<11 and ninth year had <22 away; yea, even an hundred <304 had
<9 <30 and the <55 of <438 whom he had chosen, had all
gone to the paradise of God, save it were the three who should tarry;
and <89 were other <29 ordained in <146 stead; and also many
of that generation had <46 <351

4 <96 1:15 And it came to pass that <30 was no <133 in the
land, because of the love of God <192 did dwell in the hearts of the
<267

4 <36 1:16 And <31 were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor
whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any <506 of lasciviousness;
and surely <23 <339 not be a happier <324 <174 all the <4 who
had been created by the hand of God.

4 <51 1:17 There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were <35
Lamanites, nor any <46 of —ites; but they were in one, the children
of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.

4 <39 1:18 And how <348 were they! For the Lord did bless them in
all <158 doings; yea, even they were <18 and prospered until an
<210 and ten <212 had <165 <220 and the <248 <172 from
Christ had <10 <221 and <75 was no <164 in all the land.

4 <58 1:19 And it came to pass that Nephi, he that kept this last
record, (and he kept it upon the plates of Nephi) died, and his son
Amos kept it in his <234 and he kept it upon the <20 of <44
also.

4 <7 1:20 And he kept it eighty and four years, and <74 was still
peace in the <238 save it were a small part of the <190 who had
revolted from the church and taken upon them the name of Lamanites;
therefore <34 began to be Lamanites again in the <109

4 <58 1:21 And it came to pass that Amos died also, (and it was an
<155 and ninety and four <157 from the coming of Christ) and his
son Amos kept the record in his <111 and he also kept it upon the
<113 of Nephi; and it was also written in the book of <159 <330 is
this book.

4 <68 1:22 And it came to pass that two <61 <57 had <204
<215 and the <453 <215 had all <9 away save it were a few.

4 <32 1:23 And now I, Mormon, would that ye <428 know that the
<145 had multiplied, insomuch that they were spread upon all the face
of the <169 and that they had become exceedingly rich, <414 of
<291 prosperity in Christ.

4 <48 1:24 And now, in this two <78 and <287 year <172 <172 to
be <388 them those who were lifted up in pride, such as the wearing of
costly apparel, and all <374 of fine pearls, and of the fine things
of the world.

4 <52 1:25 And from that time forth they did have <70 goods and
<4 substance no more common <55 them.

4 <25 1:26 And they <69 to be divided into classes; and they <8
to build up churches unto themselves to get gain, and <12 to deny the
true <279 of <114

4 <37 1:27 And it came to pass that when two <117 and ten <197
had <189 away <121 were many <41 in the land; yea, <8 were
many <9 <234 professed to know the <477 and yet they did deny
the more parts of his gospel, <194 that they did receive all <134
of wickedness, and did administer that <32 was sacred unto him to
whom it had been forbidden <200 of unworthiness.

4 <82 1:28 And this <93 did multiply <216 <15 of
iniquity, and <5 of the power of Satan who did get hold upon <154
hearts.

4 <31 1:29 And again, <91 was another <34 <58 denied the
Christ; and they did persecute the true <12 of <98 <40 of
<32 humility and <3 belief in <19 and they did despise them
<16 of the many miracles <35 were wrought <202 <202

4 <52 1:30 Therefore they did exercise <73 and authority over the
disciples of Jesus who did tarry with them, and they did cast them into
prison; but by the <25 of the word of God, <46 was in <21 the
prisons were rent in twain, and they went <272 doing mighty <64
<62 <62

4 <62 1:31 Nevertheless, and notwithstanding all these miracles, the
<385 did harden <99 hearts, and did seek to kill <42 even as the
Jews at Jerusalem sought to kill Jesus, according to his word.

4 <40 1:32 And they did cast them into furnaces of fire, and they
came <66 receiving no harm.

4 <23 1:33 And they also cast them into dens of wild beasts, and they
did play with the wild beasts even as a child with a lamb; and they did
come <41 from <104 <79 <44 no <44

4 <44 1:34 <107 the <101 did <101 <101 <101 for they
were led by many priests and false prophets to <377 up many churches,
and to do all <309 of iniquity. And they did smite upon the <35 of
Jesus; but the <6 of <202 did not <14 again. And thus they did
dwindle in unbelief and <337 from year to year, even until two
<394 and thirty <394 had <393 away.

4 <81 1:35 And now it came to pass in this <26 yea, in the two
<27 and <27 and first <11 <320 was a great division <117 the
people.

4 <35 1:36 And it came to pass that in this year <24 arose a <85
who were called the Nephites, and they were true believers in <333
and <38 them <21 were those who were <19 by the
Lamanites—Jacobites, and Josephites, and Zoramites;

4 <50 1:37 <335 the true <30 in <373 and the true
worshipers of <7 (among whom were the three <343 of <141 who
should tarry) were <41 <59 and Jacobites, and <40 and
Zoramites.

4 <41 1:38 And it came to pass that they who rejected the gospel were
<28 Lamanites, and Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites; and they did not
<176 in unbelief, but they did wilfully rebel against the <24 of
<103 and they did teach <244 children that they <64 not believe,
even as <10 fathers, from the beginning, did dwindle.

4 <65 1:39 And it was <460 of the wickedness and abomination of
<24 <24 even as it was in the beginning. And they were taught to
hate the <50 of God, even as the Lamanites were <13 to hate the
<13 of <45 from the <27

4 <8 1:40 And it came to pass that two <237 and forty and four
<267 had <267 away, and thus were the affairs of the <240 And the
more wicked part of the <230 did wax strong, and became exceedingly
more numerous than were the <13 of God.

4 <55 1:41 And they did still continue to <367 up churches unto
themselves, and adorn them with all <369 of precious things. And thus
did two <74 and fifty <71 pass <70 and also two <9 and
sixty years.

4 <46 1:42 And it came to pass that the <79 part of the <66
began again to <56 up the secret oaths and combinations of Gadianton.

4 <31 1:43 And also the <23 who were <243 the <5 of <12
<30 to be proud in <191 <469 <201 of <4 exceeding riches,
and become vain like unto <9 brethren, the Lamanites.

4 <28 1:44 And from this time the <318 <34 to sorrow for the
sins of the world.

4 <22 1:45 And it came to pass that when <343 <112 <119 had
<191 <121 both the <70 of <20 and the <234 had <59
<180 <112 one like unto another.

4 <17 1:46 And it came to pass that the robbers of Gadianton did
spread over all the face of the land; and <431 were none that were
righteous save it were the <86 of Jesus. And gold and silver did
they lay up in store in abundance, and did traffic in all <212 of
traffic.

4 <63 1:47 And it came to pass that after <100 <100 and five
<103 had <102 <102 (and the <102 did <256 remain in wickedness)
Amos died; and his brother, Ammaron, did keep the record in his stead.

4 <44 1:48 And it came to pass that when <44 <44 and twenty
<44 had <44 <44 <30 being constrained by the Holy Ghost,
did hide up the records which were sacred—yea, even all the sacred
<9 <9 had been handed down from generation to generation, <9
were sacred—even until the <46 <46 and twentieth year from the
coming of Christ.

4 <70 1:49 And he did hide them up unto the Lord that they might come
<307 unto the remnant of the house of Jacob according to the
prophecies and the promises of the Lord. And thus is the end of the
<122 of Ammaron.




 THE BOOK OF MORMON

Mormon Chapter 1

1:1 And now I, Mormon, make a <33 of the things <102 I have both
seen and heard, and call it the Book of Mormon.

1:2 And about the time that Ammaron hid up the <140 unto the Lord,
he came unto me, (I <170 <19 ten <178 of age, and I <355 to be
learned somewhat <239 the <257 of the learning of my people) and
<39 said unto me: I perceive that thou art a sober child, and art
quick to observe;

1:3 Therefore, when ye are <50 <229 and four <52 old I would that
ye should remember the <104 that ye have observed concerning this
people; and when ye are of that age go to the land Antum, unto a hill
<128 shall be <480 Shim; and <369 have I deposited unto the Lord
all the <258 engravings <38 this people.

1:4 And behold, ye <27 take the plates of <242 unto yourself, and
the remainder <12 ye leave in the place where they are; and ye <11
engrave on the <25 of <25 all the <86 that ye have <86
<49 this <49

1:5 And I, <211 <167 a descendant of Nephi, (and my father’s name
was Mormon) I remembered the <31 <93 <159 commanded me.

1:6 And it came to pass that I, <31 eleven <145 old, was carried by
my father into the land southward, even to the land of Zarahemla.

1:7 The whole face of the land had become covered with buildings, and
the <449 were as numerous almost, as it were the sand of the sea.

1:8 And it came to pass in this year <165 <254 to be a war between
the Nephites, who consisted of the Nephites and the Jacobites and the
Josephites and the Zoramites; and this war was <23 the <22
and the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites.

1:9 Now the <13 and the <13 and the Ishmaelites were
<225 Lamanites, and the two parties were <50 and Lamanites.

1:10 And it came to pass that the war <78 to be among them in the
borders of Zarahemla, by the waters of Sidon.

1:11 And it came to pass that the <42 had gathered together a
great number of men, even to exceed the <7 of thirty thousand. And
it came to pass that they did have in this same year a <19 of
battles, in <222 the <40 did beat the <102 and did slay many
of them.

1:12 And it came to pass that the <19 withdrew their design, and
<175 was peace settled in the land; and <6 did remain for the space
of <401 four years, that <20 was no bloodshed.

1:13 But wickedness did prevail upon the face of the <250 land,
insomuch that the Lord did take away his beloved disciples, and the
work of miracles and of healing did cease because of the iniquity of
the <345

1:14 And <54 were no gifts from the Lord, and the Holy Ghost did not
come upon any, <30 of <97 <65 and unbelief.

1:15 And I, <341 fifteen <341 of age and <6 somewhat of a sober
mind, therefore I was visited of the <42 and tasted and knew of the
goodness of Jesus.

1:16 And I did endeavor to preach unto this people, but my mouth was
shut, and I was forbidden that I should <17 unto them; for behold
they had wilfully rebelled against <77 God; and the <126 disciples
were taken away out of the <145 <93 of <16 iniquity.

1:17 But I did <185 <289 them, but I was <46 to <44 unto
<9 <23 of the hardness of <26 hearts; and <8 of the
<9 of <9 hearts the land was cursed for <7 sake.

1:18 And these Gadianton robbers, who were <44 the <359 did
infest the <64 <208 that the inhabitants thereof <349 to hide up
<30 treasures in the earth; and they became slippery, <52 the
Lord had <46 the <27 that they could not hold <74 nor retain
them again.

1:19 And it came to pass that <222 were sorceries, and witchcrafts,
and magics; and the power of the evil one was wrought upon all the face
of the <46 even unto the fulfilling of all the words of Abinadi, and
also Samuel the Lamanite.

Mormon Chapter 2

2:1 And it came to pass in that same year <60 <104 to be a war again
<510 the <395 and the <478 And notwithstanding I <264
young, was large in stature; <264 the people of Nephi appointed me
that I <232 be <134 leader, or the leader of <6 armies.

2:2 Therefore it came to pass that in my sixteenth year I did go forth
at the head of an army of the Nephites, <259 the Lamanites;
<52 three hundred and twenty and six <334 had passed away.

2:3 And it came to pass that in the <22 <22 and <22 and
seventh year the <470 did come upon us with exceedingly great
power, <226 that they did frighten my armies; <49 they would
not fight, and they <132 to retreat towards the north countries.

2:4 And it came to pass that we did come to the city of Angola, and we
did take possession of the city, and make preparations to defend
ourselves <102 the <163 And it came to pass that we did
fortify the city with our might; but <178 all our
fortifications the <91 did come upon us and did drive us out of
the city.

2:5 And they did also <15 us <162 out of the land of David.

2:6 And we marched <14 and came to the land of Joshua, which was in
the borders west by the seashore.

2:7 And it came to pass that we did gather in our <244 as fast as it
were possible, that we might get them together in one body.

2:8 But behold, the land was filled with robbers and with <227
and <111 the <191 destruction <63 hung over my people,
they did not repent of <277 evil doings; <197 <323 was blood and
carnage spread throughout all the face of the <372 both on the part of
the <334 and also on the part of the <51 and it was one
complete revolution <30 all the face of the land.

2:9 And now, the <175 had a king, and his name was Aaron; and he
came <213 us with an army of forty and four thousand. And <106 I
withstood him with <11 and two <11 And it came to pass that I
beat him with my army that he fled before me. And <29 all this was
done, and <335 <335 and thirty <355 had <355 <355

2:10 And it came to pass that the <109 <321 to <139 of <139
iniquity, and <8 to cry even as had been prophesied by <493 the
prophet; for behold no man could keep that <174 was his own, for the
thieves, and the robbers, and the murderers, and the magic art, and the
witchcraft <22 was in the <142

2:11 Thus <191 <53 to be a mourning and a lamentation in all the
land because of these things, and more especially among the <267 of
Nephi.

2:12 And it came to pass that when I, Mormon, saw <97 <34 and
<4 <41 and <3 sorrow <140 the Lord, my heart did begin to
rejoice within me, knowing the mercies and the long-suffering of the
<19 <264 supposing that he <463 be merciful unto them that they
<8 again become a righteous people.

2:13 But <133 this my joy was vain, for <54 sorrowing was not unto
repentance, <95 of the goodness of God; but it was rather the
<18 of the damned, <16 the Lord <44 not always suffer them
to take happiness in sin.

2:14 And they did not come unto Jesus with broken hearts and contrite
spirits, but they did curse God, and wish to die. Nevertheless they
<41 struggle with the sword for <73 lives.

2:15 And it came to pass that my <139 did return unto me again, and I
saw that the day of grace was <278 with them, both temporally and
spiritually; for I saw thousands of them hewn down in open rebellion
<351 <50 God, and heaped up as dung upon the face of the <243 And
thus <321 <321 and <354 and four <323 had <45 <323

2:16 And it came to pass that in the <22 <22 and <22 and fifth
year the <333 did <218 to flee <227 the <441 and they were
pursued until they came even to the land of Jashon, <17 it was
possible to stop them in <78 retreat.

2:17 And now, the city of Jashon was near the land where Ammaron had
deposited the records unto the <257 that they might not be destroyed.
And <242 I had gone according to the word of Ammaron, and taken the
plates of Nephi, and did make a record <18 to the words of
Ammaron.

2:18 And upon the <22 of Nephi I did make a full account of all the
wickedness and abominations; but upon <375 <19 I did forbear to
make a full <20 of <100 <18 and abominations, for <495 a
continual scene of <10 and abominations has been <125 mine
eyes ever since I have been sufficient to <93 the ways of man.

2:19 And wo is me <318 of <42 wickedness; for my <395 has been
filled with <267 <13 of <13 wickedness, all my days;
nevertheless, I know that I shall be lifted up at the last day.

2:20 And it came to pass that in this year the <468 of <118 <409
were hunted and driven. And it came to pass that we were driven forth
<226 we had come northward to the land which was called Shem.

2:21 And it came to pass that we did fortify the city of Shem, and we
did gather in our <56 as much as it were possible, that perhaps we
<227 save them from destruction.

2:22 And it came to pass in the <311 <311 and <311 and sixth year
they began to come upon us again.

2:23 And it came to pass that I did speak unto my people, and did urge
them with great energy, that they <446 stand boldly <199 the
Lamanites and fight for <167 wives, and <3 children, and <3
houses, and <4 homes.

2:24 And my <281 did arouse them somewhat to vigor, insomuch that they
did not flee from <40 the Lamanites, but did <47 with boldness
<443 them.

2:25 And it came to pass that we did contend with an army of thirty
thousand <22 an army of fifty thousand. And it came to pass that we
did <41 <47 them with such firmness that they did flee from <10
us.

2:26 And it came to pass that when they had fled we did pursue them
with our armies, and did meet them again, and did beat them;
nevertheless the strength of the Lord was not with us; yea, we were
left to ourselves, that the Spirit of the Lord did not abide in us;
therefore we had become weak like unto our brethren.

2:27 And my <345 did <341 <341 of this the <190 calamity of my
<202 <10 of <174 <396 and <3 abominations. But <407
we did go <311 <132 the <202 and the robbers of Gadianton,
<319 we had <339 <486 possession of the lands of our inheritance.

2:28 And the <274 <274 and <274 and ninth year had passed away.
And in the <14 <14 and fiftieth year we made a treaty with the
<51 and the <51 of <51 in <362 we did get the <48
of our inheritance divided.

2:29 And the <24 did give unto us the land northward, yea, even
to the narrow passage <32 led into the land southward. And we did
give unto the <28 all the land <12

Mormon Chapter 3

3:1 And it came to pass that the <22 did not come to battle <121
<126 ten years more had <105 <105 And <149 I had employed my
<164 the Nephites, in preparing <163 <90 and <3 arms <159
the time of battle.

3:2 And it came to pass that the Lord did say unto me: Cry unto this
people—Repent ye, and come unto me, and be ye baptized, and build up
<66 my church, and ye shall be spared.

3:3 And I did cry unto this <68 but it was in vain; and they did
not realize that it was the Lord that had spared them, and granted unto
them a chance for repentance. And behold they did harden <95 hearts
<96 the Lord <6 God.

3:4 And it came to pass that after this tenth year had <135 away,
making, in the whole, <241 <241 and sixty <149 from the coming of
Christ, the king of the <170 sent an epistle unto me, <211 gave
unto me to know that they were <160 to come <117 to <186
<65 us.

3:5 And it came to pass that I did cause my people that they should
gather themselves together at the land Desolation, to a city <48 was
in the borders, by the <269 pass <10 led into the land <257

3:6 And there we did place our <459 that we might stop the armies of
the Lamanites, that they <10 not get <379 of any of our lands;
<442 we did fortify <84 them with all our force.

3:7 And it came to pass that in the <140 <140 and <140 and first
year the <134 did come down to the city of Desolation to <123
<39 us; and it came to pass that in that year we did beat <220
insomuch that they did return to <207 own <312 again.

3:8 And in the <54 <54 and <54 and second year they did come
down <172 to <326 And we did beat them again, and did slay a great
number of <48 and <42 dead were cast into the sea.

3:9 And now, because of this <22 thing <164 my <310 the <378
had done, they began to boast in <31 own strength, and <8 to swear
before the heavens that they would avenge <211 of the blood of
<21 brethren who had been slain by <7 enemies.

3:10 And they did <31 by the heavens, and also by the throne of God,
that they <38 go up to <152 <151 <29 enemies, and <9 cut
them off from the face of the land.

3:11 And it came to pass that I, Mormon, did utterly refuse from this
time forth to be a commander and a leader of this <111 <119 of
<47 wickedness and abomination.

3:12 Behold, I had led <149 notwithstanding <14 <14 I had led
them many times to battle, and had loved <16 according to the love of
God <153 was in me, with all my heart; and my soul had been poured out
in prayer unto my God all the day long for them; nevertheless, it was
without faith, <72 of the hardness of <60 hearts.

3:13 And thrice have I delivered them out of the hands of <17
<139 and they have repented not of <9 sins.

3:14 And when they had sworn by all that had been forbidden them by our
Lord and Savior Jesus <475 that they <172 go up unto <32 enemies
to <112 and <228 <228 of the <228 of <12 brethren, behold
the voice of the Lord came unto me saying:

3:15 Vengeance is mine, and I will repay; and <100 this <477
<76 not after I had <94 <151 behold, they shall be cut off
from the face of the earth.

3:16 And it came to pass that I <224 refused to go up <257 mine
enemies; and I did even as the Lord had commanded me; and I did stand
as an idle witness to manifest unto the world the things <203 I saw
and heard, <216 to the manifestations of the Spirit <13 had
testified of <19 to come.

3:17 Therefore I write unto you, Gentiles, and also unto you, house of
Israel, when the work <99 commence, that ye <4 be about to prepare
to <471 to the land of your inheritance;

3:18 Yea, <124 I <40 unto all the ends of the earth; yea, unto
you, twelve tribes of <44 who <38 be judged <81 to your
works by the <15 whom <211 chose to be his disciples in the land of
Jerusalem.

3:19 And I <47 also unto the remnant of this <364 who <39 also
be <41 by the <36 whom <36 <36 in this land; and they <16
be <15 by the other <16 whom <16 <16 in the land of
<48

3:20 And these <144 doth the <153 <172 unto me; therefore I
<58 unto you all. And for this cause I <9 unto you, that ye may
know that ye must all <206 before the judgment-seat of <312 yea,
every soul who belongs to the whole human family of Adam; and ye must
<23 to be <77 of your works, whether they be good or evil;

3:21 And also that ye may believe the gospel of <94 <45 <231 ye
<108 have among you; and also that the Jews, the covenant <326 of
the Lord, <16 have <120 <274 besides him whom they saw and <268
that Jesus, whom they slew, was the very Christ and the very God.

3:22 And I <405 that I could persuade all ye ends of the earth to
repent and <259 to <95 <118 the <118 of Christ.

Mormon Chapter 4

4:1 And now it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and
third year the Nephites did go up with <445 armies to battle <384
the Lamanites, out of the land Desolation.

4:2 And it came to pass that the <23 of the <32 were driven
back again to the land of <25 And while they were yet weary, a
fresh army of the Lamanites did come upon them; and they had a sore
battle, insomuch that the <15 did take possession of the city
Desolation, and did slay many of the Nephites, and did take many
prisoners.

4:3 And the remainder did flee and join the inhabitants of the city
Teancum. Now the city Teancum lay in the borders by the seashore; and
it was also near the city Desolation.

4:4 And it was because the armies of the Nephites went up unto the
Lamanites that they began to be smitten; for were it not for that, the
<15 could have had no power over them.

4:5 But, behold, the judgments of God will overtake the wicked; and it
is by the wicked that the <3 are punished; for it is the <7
that stir up the hearts of the children of men unto bloodshed.

4:6 And it came to pass that the <63 did make preparations to
come against the city <127

4:7 And it came to pass in the three hundred and sixty and fourth year
the <31 did come <27 the city Teancum, that they might take
possession of the city <160 also.

4:8 And it came to pass that they were repulsed and driven back by the
Nephites. And when the <156 saw that they had <14 the <48
they did again boast of their own strength; and they went forth in
<9 own might, and took <57 <18 of the city <202

4:9 And now all these things had been done, and there had been
thousands slain on both sides, both the <58 and the Lamanites.

4:10 And it came to pass that the <123 <123 and <123 and sixth
year had passed away, and the <79 came <59 upon the <33 to
battle; and yet the <7 repented not of the evil they had <61
but persisted in <88 wickedness continually.

4:11 And it is impossible for the tongue to describe, or for man to
write a perfect description of the horrible scene of the blood and
carnage which was among the people, both of the <56 and of the
Lamanites; and every heart was hardened, so that they delighted in the
shedding of <32 <62

4:12 And <134 never had been so great <75 <40 all the
<280 of Lehi, nor even <9 all the house of Israel, according to
the words of the Lord, as was <16 this people.

4:13 And it came to pass that the <141 did take <202 of the
city Desolation, and this <399 <128 number did exceed the <4 of
the <252

4:14 And they did also march forward <297 the city <297 and did
drive the <462 <249 out of her, and did take many prisoners
both women and children, and did offer them up as sacrifices unto <52
idol gods.

4:15 And it came to pass that in the <234 <234 and <234 and
seventh year, the <162 being angry <81 the <94 had
sacrificed <34 <46 and <3 <47 that they did go <75 the
<16 with exceedingly <154 anger, insomuch that they did beat
<260 the Lamanites, and <86 them out of <28 lands.

4:16 And the <27 did not come <20 <35 the <55 until
the <68 <68 and seventy and fifth year.

4:17 And in this year they did come down <25 the <25 with all
<44 powers; and they were not numbered <88 of the greatness of
<13 number.

4:18 And from this time <154 did the <30 gain no power over the
<83 but began to be swept off by them even as a dew before the
sun.

4:19 And it came to pass that the <97 did come down <71 the
city Desolation; and <290 was an <135 sore battle fought in the
land <247 in the <339 they did beat the <242

4:20 And they fled <130 from <54 them, and they came to the city
Boaz; and <40 they did stand <50 the <56 with exceeding
boldness, <180 that the <8 did not beat them <158 they had
come <37 the second time.

4:21 And when they had come the <12 time, the <126 were driven
and slaughtered with an <86 <221 slaughter; <150 <238 and
<4 <376 were <35 <247 unto idols.

4:22 And it came to pass that the <33 did <17 flee from <90
<91 taking all the <328 with <6 both in towns and villages.

4:23 And now I, Mormon, seeing that the <90 were about to
overthrow the land, therefore I did go to the hill Shim, and did take
up all the records <154 Ammaron had hid up unto the Lord.

Mormon Chapter 5

5:1 And it came to pass that I did go <243 <454 the Nephites, and did
repent of the oath <38 I had made that I would no more assist them;
and they gave me command <107 of <129 armies, for they looked upon me
as though I could deliver them from <15 afflictions.

5:2 But behold, I was without hope, for I knew the judgments of the
Lord <55 should come upon <49 for they repented not of <31
iniquities, but did struggle for <7 lives <30 calling upon that
Being who created them.

5:3 And it came to pass that the <156 did come <259 us as we
had fled to the city of Jordan; but <69 they were <236 back that
they did not take the city at that <264

5:4 And it came to pass that they came <41 us again, and we did
maintain the city. And <315 were also other cities <99 were
maintained by <167 <6 strongholds did cut them off that they
<139 not get into the country <15 lay <264 us, to destroy the
<264 of our land.

5:5 And it came to pass that whatsoever lands we had passed by, and the
<23 thereof were not gathered in, were destroyed by the
<461 and <147 towns, and villages, and <71 were burned with
fire; and thus three hundred and seventy and nine years <38 away.

5:6 And it came to pass that in the <21 <21 and eightieth year
the <166 did come <246 <126 us to battle, and we did <434
<9 them boldly; but it was all in vain, for so <400 were <67
numbers that they did tread the people of the <389 under <13
feet.

5:7 And it came to pass that we did <51 take to flight, and those
whose flight was swifter than the Lamanites’ did escape, and <12
<12 <12 did not exceed the <12 were swept down and
destroyed.

5:8 And now <242 I, <420 do not desire to harrow up the souls of
men in casting <191 them such an awful scene of blood and carnage as
was laid <14 mine eyes; but I, knowing that these things must surely
be made known, and that all <10 <226 are hid must be revealed upon
the house-tops—

5:9 And also that a knowledge of <32 <22 must come unto the
remnant of <9 people, and also unto the Gentiles, who the Lord hath
said <387 scatter this <15 and this <155 <7 be counted as
naught <466 them—therefore I write a small abridgment, daring not to
give a full account of the <51 <73 I have seen, because of the
commandment <9 I have received, and also that ye might not have too
<212 sorrow <20 of the wickedness of this people.

5:10 And now <159 this I speak unto <217 seed, and also to the
Gentiles who have care for the house of Israel, that realize and know
from whence <23 blessings come.

5:11 For I know that such will <55 for the calamity of the <29 of
Israel; yea, they will <13 for the destruction of this people; they
will <10 that this <129 had not repented that they <93 have been
clasped in the arms of Jesus.

5:12 Now <169 <127 are written unto the <177 of the <50 of
Jacob; and they are <13 after this manner, <121 it is known of
God that <126 will not bring them forth unto them; and they are
to be hid up unto the Lord that they may come <18 in his own due
time.

5:13 And this is the <183 <183 I have received; and <160
they shall come <26 according to the <15 of the Lord, when he
<13 see fit, in his wisdom.

5:14 And <27 they <13 go unto the unbelieving of the Jews; and
for this intent <13 they go—that they may be persuaded that Jesus is
the Christ, the Son of the living God; that the Father may <106 about,
through his most Beloved, his <248 and eternal purpose, in restoring
the Jews, or all the <148 of <227 to the land of <224 inheritance,
<100 the Lord <6 God hath given them, unto the fulfilling of his
covenant;

5:15 And also that the seed of this <214 may more fully believe his
gospel, <34 <88 go <127 unto them from the Gentiles; for this
<20 <12 be scattered, and <4 become a dark, a filthy, and a
loathsome <381 beyond the description of that <33 ever hath been
amongst us, yea, even that <10 hath been <390 the Lamanites, and
this <233 of <85 unbelief and idolatry.

5:16 For <165 the Spirit of the Lord hath already ceased to strive
with <22 fathers; and they are without Christ and God in the world;
and they are driven about as chaff before the wind.

5:17 They were once a delightsome <81 and they had <30 for <38
shepherd; yea, they were led even by God the Father.

5:18 But now, <69 they are led <43 by Satan, even as <46 is
<52 <49 the wind, or as a vessel is tossed <18 upon the waves,
<78 sail or anchor, or <5 anything wherewith to steer her; and
even as she is, so are they.

5:19 And <52 the Lord hath reserved <75 blessings, <148 they
<410 have received in the land, for the <479 who <187 possess the
land.

5:20 But <30 it <12 come to pass that they <6 be <80 and
scattered by the <222 and <416 they have been <12 and
<12 by the Gentiles, <29 then will the Lord remember the
covenant <61 he made unto Abraham and unto all the <305 of Israel.

5:21 And also the Lord will <25 the prayers of the righteous,
<28 have been put up unto him for them.

5:22 And then, O ye <55 how can ye stand <157 the power of God,
except ye <88 repent and turn from your evil ways?

5:23 Know ye not that ye are in the hands of God? Know ye not that he
hath all power, and at his <401 command the earth <39 be rolled
together as a scroll?

5:24 Therefore, <51 ye, and humble yourselves <65 him, lest he
<23 come out in justice against you—lest a remnant of the seed of
Jacob <15 go <386 <344 you as a lion, and tear you in pieces, and
there is none to deliver.

Mormon Chapter 6

6:1 And now I finish my record concerning the destruction of my <320
the Nephites. And it came to pass that we did march <52 <75 the
Lamanites.

6:2 And I, Mormon, wrote an epistle unto the king of the <413 and
desired of him that he would grant unto us that we <281 gather
<125 our <468 unto the land of Cumorah, by a hill <209 was
called <8 and <93 we could give them battle.

6:3 And it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites did <47 unto
me the thing <34 I desired.

6:4 And it came to pass that we did <98 <98 to the land of <51
and we did pitch our tents around <399 the hill Cumorah; and it was in
a land of many waters, rivers, and fountains; and here we had hope to
gain advantage over the <136

6:5 And when three hundred and eighty and four years had passed away,
we had gathered in all the remainder of our <128 unto the land of
Cumorah.

6:6 And it came to pass that when we had <27 in all our <24 in
one to the land of <96 behold I, <191 began to be old; and
knowing it to be the last struggle of my <231 and having been
commanded of the Lord that I should not suffer the records <152 had
been handed down by our fathers, <9 were sacred, to fall into the
<362 of the <234 (for the <183 <230 destroy them)
therefore I made this <285 out of the plates of Nephi, and hid up in
the hill Cumorah all the <50 <41 had been entrusted to me by the
hand of the Lord, save it were these few <32 <19 I gave unto my
son Moroni.

6:7 And it came to pass that my <104 with their wives and <3
children, did now <132 the armies of the <80 marching towards
them; and with that awful fear of death <46 fills the breasts of all
the wicked, did they await to receive them.

6:8 And it came to pass that they came to battle <442 us, and every
soul was filled with terror because of the greatness of <66 numbers.

6:9 And it came to pass that they did fall upon my <219 with the
sword, and with the bow, and with the arrow, and with the ax, and with
all manner of weapons of war.

6:10 And it came to pass that my men were hewn down, yea, even my ten
thousand who were with me, and I fell wounded in the midst; and they
<316 by me that they did not put an end to my life.

6:11 And when they had gone through and hewn down all my <89 save it
were twenty and four of us, (among whom was my son Moroni) and we
<298 survived the dead of our <202 did <194 on the morrow, when
the <196 had returned unto <144 camps, from the top of the hill
<347 the ten <93 of my <53 who were hewn <106 being led in
the front by me.

6:12 And we also beheld the ten <26 of my <26 who were led by
my son <276

6:13 And behold, the ten <20 of Gidgiddonah had fallen, and he
also in the midst.

6:14 And Lamah had fallen with his ten thousand; and Gilgal had <8
with his ten <9 and Limhah had <9 with his ten <8 and
Jeneum had <9 with his ten <9 and Cumenihah, and Moronihah,
and Antionum, and Shiblom, and Shem, and Josh, had <19 with <124
ten <69 each.

6:15 And it came to pass that there were ten more who did fall by the
<272 with <27 ten <26 each; yea, even all my <172 save it
were those <198 and four who were with me, and also a few who had
escaped into the south countries, and a few who had deserted over unto
the <477 had fallen; and <47 flesh, and bones, and blood lay
upon the face of the earth, <192 left by the <502 of <54 who slew
them to molder upon the land, and to crumble and to return to <37
mother earth.

6:16 And my soul was rent with anguish, <399 of the slain of my
<98 and I cried:

6:17 O ye fair ones, how could ye have departed from the ways of the
Lord! O ye fair <16 how <16 ye have rejected that Jesus, who stood
with open arms to <474 you!

6:18 Behold, if ye had not done this, ye would not have fallen. But
<264 ye are <260 and I mourn your loss.

6:19 O ye fair sons and daughters, ye fathers and mothers, ye husbands
and wives, ye fair <65 how is it that ye <69 have fallen!

6:20 But <44 ye are gone, and my sorrows cannot bring your return.

6:21 And the day soon cometh that your mortal must put on immortality,
and these bodies which are now moldering in corruption must soon become
incorruptible bodies; and then ye must stand before the judgment-seat
of Christ to be judged according to your works and if it so be that ye
are righteous, then are ye blessed with your <101 who have gone
<34 you.

6:22 O that ye had repented <11 this great destruction had come upon
you. But <103 ye are <103 and the Father, yea, the Eternal Father
of heaven, knoweth your state; and he doeth with you <68 to his
justice and mercy.

Mormon Chapter 7

7:1 And now, <41 I <196 speak somewhat unto the remnant of this
<477 who are spared, if it so be that God may give unto them my
words, that they may know of the things of <308 fathers; yea, I <37
unto you, ye <38 of the house of Israel; and <167 are the words
<170 I speak:

7:2 Know ye that ye are of the <23 of Israel.

7:3 Know ye that ye must come unto repentance, or ye <225 be saved.

7:4 Know ye that ye must lay down your weapons of war, and delight no
more in the shedding of blood, and take them not again, save it be that
God shall command you.

7:5 Know ye that ye must come to the knowledge of your fathers, and
repent of all your sins and iniquities, and believe in Jesus Christ,
that he is the Son of God, and that he was <426 by the Jews, and by
the power of the <214 he hath risen <67 whereby he hath gained the
victory over the grave; and also in him is the sting of death swallowed
up.

7:6 And he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead, <36 man
must be raised to <328 <283 his judgment-seat.

7:7 And he hath brought to pass the redemption of the world, <26 he
that is found guiltless <25 him at the judgment day hath it given
unto him to dwell in the presence of God in his kingdom, to sing
ceaseless praises with the choirs above, unto the <325 and unto the
Son, and unto the Holy Ghost, <244 are one God, in a state of
happiness <10 hath no end.

7:8 Therefore repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus, and lay
hold upon the gospel of <178 <27 <212 be set <85 you, not only
in this record but also in the <5 <17 <17 come unto the
Gentiles from the <189 <10 <12 <11 come from the <10 unto
you.

7:9 For <380 this is written for the intent that ye may <234
that; and if ye <6 that ye will <4 this also; and if ye
<7 this ye will know concerning your <269 and also the
marvelous <504 <56 were wrought by the <246 of God among them.

7:10 And ye will also know that ye are a <399 of the seed of Jacob;
therefore ye are numbered <26 the <446 of the first covenant; and
if it so be that ye <63 in <135 and are baptized, <16 with
water, then with fire and with the Holy <187 following the example of
our Savior, according to that <77 he hath commanded us, it <137 be
well with you in the day of judgment. Amen.

Mormon Chapter 8

8:1 Behold I, Moroni, do finish the <166 of my father, Mormon.
Behold, I have but few <509 to write, <48 <4 I have been
<51 by my father.

8:2 And now it came to pass that after the great and tremendous battle
at Cumorah, <196 the Nephites who had escaped into the country
southward were hunted by the Lamanites, until they were all destroyed.

8:3 And my father also was killed by them, and I even remain alone to
write the sad tale of the destruction of my people. But <51 they
are gone, and I fulfil the commandment of my <84 And whether they
will slay me, I know not.

8:4 <335 I will <41 and hide up the records in the earth; and
whither I go it mattereth not.

8:5 <140 my <77 hath made this record, and he hath <305 the
<305 thereof. And <67 I would <40 it also if I had room upon
the plates, but I have not; and ore I have none, for I am alone. My
<43 hath been slain in battle, and all my kinsfolk, and I have not
friends nor <72 to go; and how long the Lord will suffer that I may
live I know not.

8:6 <84 four hundred years have passed away since the coming of our
Lord and Savior.

8:7 And <89 the Lamanites have <199 my people, the Nephites, down
from city to city and from place to place, even <212 they are no more;
and <242 has been their fall; yea, <6 and <400 is the
<201 of my <37 the Nephites.

8:8 And <51 it is the hand of the Lord <296 hath done it. And
behold also, the <66 are at war one with another; and the whole
face of this land is one continual round of murder and bloodshed; and
no one knoweth the end of the war.

8:9 And now, <56 I say no more <483 <288 for there are none
save it be the <55 and robbers that do exist upon the face of the
land.

8:10 And <26 are none that do know the true God save it be the
disciples of Jesus, who did tarry in the land <143 the wickedness of
the <496 was so <139 that the Lord <264 not <213 them to <353
with the people; and <330 they be upon the face of the land no man
knoweth.

8:11 But <99 my <268 and I have seen <100 and they have
ministered unto us.

8:12 And whoso receiveth this <328 and <510 not condemn it because
of the imperfections <181 are in it, the same <15 know of greater
<487 than these. <275 I am Moroni; and were it possible, I <86
make all <16 known unto you.

8:13 <21 I make an end of speaking <170 this <442 I am the
son of Mormon, and my <86 was a descendant of Nephi.

8:14 And I am the same who hideth up this record unto the Lord; the
plates thereof are of no worth, <90 of the <475 of the Lord.
For he truly saith that no one <94 have them to get gain; but the
<36 <30 is of <180 worth; and <130 <17 bring it to light,
him will the Lord bless.

8:15 For none can have power to <20 it to light save it be given him
of God; for God wills that it <38 be done with an eye single to his
glory, or the welfare of the ancient and long dispersed covenant <246
of the <89

8:16 And blessed be he that <35 <53 this thing to light; for it
<9 be brought out of darkness unto <85 according to the word of
God; yea, it <17 be <17 out of the earth, and it <9 shine
forth out of darkness, and come unto the knowledge of the <293 and
it <18 be done by the <112 of God.

8:17 And if <356 be faults they be the <4 of a man. But <302 we
know no fault; nevertheless God <421 all things; therefore, he that
condemneth, let him be aware lest he <47 be in danger of hell fire.

8:18 And he that saith: Show unto me, or ye <20 be smitten—let him
beware lest he commandeth that <320 is forbidden of the <145

8:19 For <63 the same that judgeth rashly <27 be judged <4
again; for <137 to his works <11 his wages be; <73 he
that smiteth <9 be smitten again, of the <38

8:20 Behold what the scripture says—man <16 not smite, neither <4
he judge; for judgment is mine, <289 the Lord, and vengeance is mine
also, and I will repay.

8:21 And he that <28 breathe out wrath and strifes against the work
of the <30 and <8 the <246 <246 of the Lord who are the
house of Israel, and <29 say: We will destroy the work of the <26
and the Lord will not remember his <31 <133 he hath made unto the
<30 of Israel—the same is in <173 to be hewn down and cast into the
fire;

8:22 For the eternal purposes of the Lord <54 roll on, until all his
promises <8 be fulfilled.

8:23 Search the prophecies of Isaiah. <473 I cannot write them. Yea,
behold I say unto you, that those saints who have gone before me, who
have possessed this land, <38 cry, yea, even from the dust will they
cry unto the <471 and as the Lord liveth he will <105 the <105
<106 he hath made with <52

8:24 And he <295 their prayers, that they were in behalf of <8
brethren. And he <14 <6 faith, for in his name could they remove
mountains; and in his name <9 they cause the earth to shake; and by
the <364 of his word did they <15 prisons to tumble to the earth;
yea, even the fiery furnace <30 not harm them, <259 wild beasts
nor poisonous serpents, because of the <33 of his word.

8:25 And <323 <69 prayers were also in <82 of him that the Lord
should suffer to <479 these things forth.

8:26 And no one need say they <150 not come, for they surely shall,
for the Lord hath spoken it; for out of the <97 <19 they <19 by
the hand of the <269 and none can stay it; and it <17 come in a day
when it <8 be said that miracles are done away; and it <10 come
even as if one <78 speak from the dead.

8:27 And it <18 come in a day when the blood of <243 <10 cry unto
the <59 <130 of secret combinations and the <431 of darkness.

8:28 Yea, it <21 come in a day when the <149 of God <10 be denied,
and churches become defiled and be lifted up in the pride of <158
hearts; yea, even in a day when leaders of <22 and teachers <30
rise in the <21 of <21 hearts, even to the envying of them who
belong to <12 churches.

8:29 Yea, it <27 come in a day when there <7 be heard of fires,
and tempests, and vapors of smoke in foreign lands;

8:30 And <21 <21 also be <22 of wars, rumors of <3 and
earthquakes in divers places.

8:31 Yea, it <21 come in a day when <28 <7 be great pollutions
upon the face of the <296 <12 <12 be murders, and robbing, and
lying, and deceivings, and whoredoms, and all manner of abominations;
when <20 <20 be many who will say, Do this, or do that, and it
mattereth not, for the Lord will uphold such at the last day. But wo
unto such for they are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of
iniquity.

8:32 Yea, it <52 come in a day when <59 <7 be <179 built up
that <7 say: Come unto me, and for your money you <10 be forgiven
of your sins.

8:33 O ye wicked and perverse and stiffnecked people, why have ye <36
up <40 unto yourselves to get gain? Why have ye transfigured the
holy word of God, that ye might <392 damnation upon your souls?
Behold, look ye unto the revelations of God; for <423 the time
cometh at that day when all <416 <416 must be fulfilled.

8:34 <28 the Lord hath shown unto me <191 and marvelous <18
concerning that which must shortly <408 at that day when <31 <13
<103 come forth among you.

8:35 <34 I <386 unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are
not. But <70 Jesus Christ hath <51 you unto me, and I know your
doing.

8:36 And I know that ye do walk in the <342 of your <362 and <179
are none save a few only who do not lift themselves up in the <21 of
<352 <364 unto the wearing of very fine apparel, unto envying, and
strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all <282 of iniquities;
and your churches, yea, even every one, have <427 polluted <460 of
the <41 of your hearts.

8:37 For <98 ye do love money, and your substance, and your fine
<51 and the adorning of your <39 more than ye love the poor
and the needy, the sick and the afflicted.

8:38 O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites, ye teachers, who sell <247
for that <186 will canker, why have ye <71 the holy church of
God? Why are ye ashamed to take upon you the name of Christ? Why do ye
not think that greater is the value of an endless happiness than that
misery <44 never dies—because of the praise of the world?

8:39 Why do ye adorn <65 with that <20 hath no life, and yet
suffer the hungry, and the <99 and the naked, and the sick and the
afflicted to pass by you, and notice them not?

8:40 Yea, why do ye build up your secret abominations to get gain, and
cause that widows should mourn before the Lord, and also orphans to
<9 <9 the <9 and also the blood of <233 fathers and <3
husbands to cry unto the Lord from the ground, for vengeance upon your
heads?

8:41 <325 the sword of <13 hangeth over you; and the time soon
<387 that he avengeth the <44 of the saints upon you, for he will
not <117 <51 cries any longer.

Mormon Chapter 9

9:1 And now, I <370 also <396 those who do not believe in
Christ.

9:2 <62 will ye <11 in the day of your visitation—behold, when
the Lord <410 <419 yea, even that <433 day when the earth <10 be
rolled together as a scroll, and the elements <11 melt with fervent
heat, yea, in that <25 day when ye <13 be brought to stand <147
the Lamb of God—then will ye say that <401 is no God?

9:3 Then will ye longer deny the Christ, or can ye behold the Lamb of
God? Do ye suppose that ye <44 dwell with him under a consciousness
of your guilt? Do ye <16 that ye could be happy to <19 with that
holy Being, when your souls are racked with a <27 of guilt
that ye have ever abused his laws?

9:4 <140 I say unto you that ye would be more miserable to <40
with a holy and just God, <64 a <37 of your filthiness
<114 him, than ye <24 to <21 with the damned <57 in hell.

9:5 For <457 when ye <96 be <140 to see your nakedness <28
God, and also the glory of God, and the holiness of Jesus <132 it
will kindle a flame of unquenchable fire upon you.

9:6 O then ye unbelieving, turn ye unto the Lord; cry mightily unto the
Father in the name of Jesus, that perhaps ye may be found spotless,
pure, fair, and white, having been cleansed by the <306 of the Lamb,
at that <225 and last day.

9:7 And again I <295 unto you who deny the revelations of God, and say
that they are done away, that <235 are no revelations, nor prophecies,
nor gifts, nor healing, nor speaking with tongues, and the
interpretation of tongues;

9:8 Behold I say unto you, he that denieth these things knoweth not the
gospel of Christ; yea, he has not read the scriptures; if so, he does
not understand them.

9:9 For do we not read that God is the same yesterday, today, and
forever, and in him <79 is no variableness neither shadow of
changing?

9:10 And now if ye have imagined up unto yourselves a god who doth
vary, and in whom <31 is <28 of changing, then have ye <21 up
unto <22 a god who is not God of miracles.

9:11 But <249 I will show unto you a God of miracles, even the God
of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and it is that
same God who created the heavens and the earth, and all <144 that in
them are.

9:12 <163 he <20 Adam, and by Adam came the fall of man. And
because of the fall of man came <299 <299 even the <272 and the
Son; and <17 of <12 Christ came the redemption of man.

9:13 And <14 of the <11 of man, which came by <21 <33
they are <355 back into the presence of the <319 yea, this is
wherein all men are redeemed, <31 the death of <46 bringeth to
pass the resurrection, <36 <7 to pass a <44 from an
endless sleep, from <12 sleep all men <401 be awakened by the power
of God when the trump <12 sound; and they <4 come forth, both
small and great, and all <10 stand <422 his bar, being redeemed and
loosed from this eternal band of death, <46 <68 is a temporal
death.

9:14 And then cometh the judgment of the Holy One upon them; and then
<12 the time that he that is filthy <49 be <3 still; and he
that is righteous <10 be <3 <10 he that is happy <8 be
<4 <9 and he that is unhappy <10 be <3 still.

9:15 And now, O all ye that have <291 up unto <290 a god who
can do no <275 I would ask of you, have all <395 <251 passed,
of <100 I have spoken? Has the end come yet? <254 I say unto you,
Nay; and God has not ceased to be a God of <329

9:16 Behold, are not the <39 that God hath wrought marvelous in our
eyes? Yea, and who can comprehend the <11 works of God?

9:17 Who <99 say that it was not a miracle that by his word the
heaven and the earth should be; and by the <220 of his word man was
<333 of the dust of the earth; and by the <17 of his word have
miracles been wrought?

9:18 And who <55 say that <309 <284 did not many mighty miracles?
And <450 were many <7 <25 <93 by the hands of the
apostles.

9:19 And if <19 were <17 <17 then, why has God <134 to be
a God of <13 and yet be an unchangeable Being? And <466 I say
unto you he changeth not; if so he <192 cease to be God; and he
ceaseth not to be God, and is a God of <173

9:20 And the reason why he <20 to do <51 among the children of
men is <389 that they dwindle in unbelief, and depart from the right
way, and know not the God in whom they <163 trust.

9:21 <216 I say unto you that whoso believeth in <446 doubting
nothing, whatsoever he <147 ask the <485 in the name of <151 it
<11 be granted him; and this promise is unto all, even unto the ends
of the earth.

9:22 For <127 thus said <181 <44 the Son of God, unto his
disciples who <69 tarry, yea, and also to all his disciples, in the
hearing of the multitude: Go ye into all the world, and preach the
gospel to every creature;

9:23 And he that <93 and is baptized <78 be saved, but he that
<11 not <9 be damned;

9:24 And <373 signs <10 follow them that believe—in my name <7
they cast out devils; they <7 speak with new tongues; they <6
take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it <13 not hurt
<486 they <6 lay <276 on the sick and they <8 recover;

9:25 And whosoever <8 believe in my name, <173 <172 unto him
will I confirm all my words, even unto the ends of the <157

9:26 And now, <158 who can stand against the <408 of the Lord? Who
can deny his sayings? Who will rise up <16 the almighty <377 of
the <18 Who will despise the <26 of the <8 Who will <8 the
<280 of Christ? <251 all ye who are despisers of the <20 of
the Lord, for ye <88 wonder and perish.

9:27 O then <31 not, and <12 not, but hearken unto the words of
the <26 and ask the <275 in the name of <246 for what things
soever ye <39 <96 in need. Doubt not, but be believing, and begin
as in times of old, and come unto the Lord with all your heart, and
work out your own salvation with fear and trembling before him.

9:28 Be wise in the days of your probation; strip yourselves of all
uncleanness; ask not, that ye may consume it on your lusts, but ask
with a firmness unshaken, that ye will yield to no temptation, but that
ye will serve the true and living God.

9:29 See that ye are not <303 unworthily; see that ye partake not
of the sacrament of <395 <12 but see that ye do all <125 in
worthiness, and do it in the name of <139 <385 the Son of the
<49 God; and if ye do this, and endure to the end, ye will in nowise
be cast out.

9:30 <217 I <332 unto you as though I spake from the dead; for I
know that ye <181 have my words.

9:31 Condemn me not because of mine imperfection, neither my father,
<8 of his <8 <8 them who have written <172 him;
but rather give thanks unto God that he hath made manifest unto you our
imperfections, that ye may learn to be more wise than we have been.

9:32 And now, <344 we have <41 this record according to our
knowledge, in the characters which are called among us the reformed
Egyptian, being handed down and altered by us, <24 to our manner
of speech.

9:33 And if our plates had been sufficiently large we should have
<50 in Hebrew; but the Hebrew hath been <34 by us also; and if
we could have <18 in Hebrew, <74 ye would have had no
imperfection in our record.

9:34 But the Lord knoweth the <219 <81 we have written, and also
that none other people <14 our language; and <156 that none
<10 <10 <10 our language, therefore he hath prepared means for
the interpretation thereof.

9:35 And these <41 are <66 that we may rid our garments of the
blood of our brethren, who have dwindled in unbelief.

9:36 And <87 <28 <28 <69 we have desired concerning our
<21 yea, even their restoration to the knowledge of <293 are
<153 to the prayers of all the saints who have dwelt in the land.

9:37 And may the Lord <319 <339 grant that <35 <24 may be
answered <32 to <8 faith; and may God the <481 remember the
covenant <64 he hath made with the house of Israel; and may he bless
them forever, through faith on the name of <45 Christ. Amen.




 THE BOOK OF ETHER


The <268 of the Jaredites, taken from the twenty-four <237 found by
the <171 of Limhi in the days of king Mosiah.

Ether Chapter 1

1:1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to give an account of those ancient
inhabitants who were destroyed by the hand of the Lord upon the face of
this north country.

1:2 And I take mine <31 from the twenty and four <69 <123 were
<72 by the <71 of Limhi, <9 is <346 the Book of Ether.

1:3 And as I suppose that the first part of this record, <22 speaks
<217 the creation of the world, and also of Adam, and an <53
from that time even to the great tower, and whatsoever <246
transpired <395 the children of men until that time, is had <10 the
Jews—

1:4 Therefore I do not write <120 <27 <55 <27 from the
days of Adam <28 that time; but they are had upon the plates; and
whoso findeth them, the same will have power that he may get the full
account.

1:5 But <317 I give not the full account, but a part of the <93
I give, from the tower down <53 they were destroyed.

1:6 And on this wise do I give the <42 He that wrote this <246
was Ether, and he was a descendant of Coriantor.

1:7 Coriantor was the son of Moron.

1:8 And Moron was the son of Ethem.

1:9 And Ethem was the son of Ahah.

1:10 And Ahah was the son of Seth.

1:11 And Seth was the son of Shiblon.

1:12 And Shiblon was the son of Com.

1:13 And Com was the son of Coriantum.

1:14 And Coriantum was the son of Amnigaddah.

1:15 And Amnigaddah was the son of Aaron.

1:16 And Aaron was a <109 of Heth, who was the son of Hearthom.

1:17 And Hearthom was the son of Lib.

1:18 And Lib was the son of Kish.

1:19 And Kish was the son of Corom.

1:20 And Corom was the son of Levi.

1:21 And Levi was the son of Kim.

1:22 And Kim was the son of Morianton.

1:23 And Morianton was a <83 of Riplakish.

1:24 And Riplakish was the son of Shez.

1:25 And Shez was the son of Heth.

1:26 And Heth was the son of Com.

1:27 And Com was the son of <160

1:28 And <160 was the son of Emer.

1:29 And Emer was the son of Omer.

1:30 And Omer was the son of Shule.

1:31 And Shule was the son of Kib.

1:32 And Kib was the son of Orihah, who was the son of Jared;

1:33 Which Jared came forth with his brother and their families, with
some others and <7 <7 from the <445 <445 at the time the
Lord confounded the language of the people, and swore in his wrath that
they should be scattered upon all the face of the earth; and according
to the word of the Lord the people were scattered.

1:34 And the <64 of <71 being a large and mighty man, and a man
highly favored of the Lord, Jared, his brother, said unto him: Cry unto
the <11 that he will not confound us that we may not understand our
words.

1:35 And it came to pass that the <54 of <54 did cry unto the
<34 and the Lord had compassion upon <144 therefore he did not
<42 the <118 of <10 and <25 and his <30 were not
confounded.

1:36 Then <13 said unto his brother: Cry again unto the <41 and it
may be that he will turn away his anger from them who are our friends,
that he <50 not <182 language.

1:37 And it came to pass that the <56 of <48 did cry unto the
<45 and the Lord had <86 upon <28 friends and <3 families
also, that they were not <78

1:38 And it came to pass that <35 spake <79 unto his <162
saying: Go and inquire of the Lord whether he will drive us out of the
land, and if he will <11 us out of the <10 cry unto him whither we
shall go. And who knoweth but the Lord will carry us <295 into a land
which is choice above all the earth? And if it so be, let us be
faithful unto the <104 that we may receive it for our inheritance.

1:39 And it came to pass that the <132 of <97 did cry unto the
Lord <299 to that <51 had been spoken by the mouth of Jared.

1:40 And it came to pass that the Lord did hear the <36 of <292
and had <161 upon him, and said unto him:

1:41 Go to and gather together thy flocks, both male and female, of
every kind; and also of the seed of the earth of <11 <11 and thy
families; and also <83 thy <51 and his family; and also thy
<211 and <211 <424 and the <6 of <18 and <8
families.

1:42 And when thou hast done this thou shalt go at the head of them
down into the valley <119 is northward. And there will I meet thee,
and I will go before thee into a land <19 is <189 <189 all the
lands of the earth.

1:43 And <31 will I bless thee and thy seed, and raise up unto me of
thy <9 and of the seed of thy <279 and they who <248 go with
<58 a great nation. And <36 <10 be none greater than the nation
<61 I will <39 up unto me of thy <38 upon all the face of the
<68 And thus I will do unto thee because this long time ye have
cried unto me.

Ether Chapter 2

2:1 And it came to pass that <159 and his <76 and <162 <170
and also the <172 of <13 and his <191 and <13 <13 went
down into the <157 <77 was northward, (and the name of the <9
was Nimrod, being called after the mighty hunter) with <27 flocks
<22 they had gathered together, male and <254 of <242 kind.

2:2 And they did also lay snares and catch fowls of the air; and they
did also prepare a vessel, in <36 they did <395 with them the fish
of the waters.

2:3 And they did also <17 with them deseret, which, by
interpretation, is a honey bee; and thus they did <16 with them
swarms of bees, and all manner of that <48 was upon the face of the
<464 seeds of <86 <86

2:4 And it came to pass that when they had come down into the <128 of
Nimrod the Lord came down and talked with the <158 of Jared; and he
was in a cloud, and the <12 of <175 saw him not.

2:5 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded them that they should
go forth into the wilderness, yea, into that quarter where <280 never
had man been. And it came to pass that the Lord did go <353 them, and
did talk with them as he stood in a <66 and gave directions whither
they <48 travel.

2:6 And it came to pass that they did travel in the <59 and did
build barges, in <148 they did cross many waters, <248 directed
continually by the hand of the Lord.

2:7 And the Lord would not suffer that they <52 stop beyond the sea
in the <43 but he <16 that they <14 come <113 even unto
the land of promise, <52 was <444 <444 all other lands, <7 the
Lord God had preserved for a righteous people.

2:8 And he had sworn in his wrath unto the <177 of Jared, that whoso
<47 possess this land of <43 from that time henceforth and
forever, <13 serve him, the true and only God, or they <10 be
swept off when the fulness of his <42 <11 come upon them.

2:9 And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this <282
that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever <486 <493 <65 it
<4 <56 God, or they <5 be <50 off when the <50 of his
<51 <11 come upon <51 And the <11 of his <10 cometh upon
them when they are ripened in iniquity.

2:10 For behold, this is a land <145 is <152 <152 all <152 lands;
wherefore he that doth <61 it <44 <60 God or <4 be <59
off; for it is the everlasting decree of God. And it is not until the
<62 of iniquity among the children of the <108 that they are <30
off.

2:11 And this <79 unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the
<138 of God—that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities
<49 the <48 come, that ye may not bring down the <9 of the
<120 of God upon you as the inhabitants of the land have hitherto
done.

2:12 Behold, this is a <120 <77 and <177 <177 <109 <116
it <4 be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all <137
nations under heaven, if they will but <136 the God of the <33 who
is Jesus Christ, who hath been manifested by the things <169 we have
written.

2:13 And now I proceed with my record; for <191 it came to pass that
the Lord did <104 <493 and his brethren <361 even to that great sea
<39 divideth the lands. And as they came to the sea they pitched
their tents; and they called the name of the place Moriancumer; and
they dwelt in tents, and <4 in tents upon the seashore for the space
of four years.

2:14 And it came to pass at the end of four years that the Lord came
again unto the <397 of <397 and stood in a cloud and talked with
him. And for the <44 of three hours did the Lord talk with the
<27 of <27 and chastened him because he remembered not to call
upon the name of the <510

2:15 And the <25 of <133 repented of the evil <127 he had done,
and did call upon the name of the Lord for his <151 who were with
him. And the Lord said unto him: I will forgive thee and thy <18
of <150 sins; but thou shalt not sin any more, for ye <252 remember
that my Spirit will not always strive with man; wherefore, if ye will
sin <317 ye are fully ripe ye <24 be cut off from the presence of
the <96 And these are my thoughts upon the land <91 I <21 give
you for your inheritance; for it <9 be a land <319 <439 all <302
<235

2:16 And the Lord said: Go to work and build, after the manner of
barges <40 ye have <358 built. And it came to pass that the
<151 of <151 did go to work, and also his brethren, and built
<28 <34 the <34 <31 they had built, according to the
instructions of the <91 And they were small, and they were light upon
the water, even like unto the lightness of a fowl upon the water.

2:17 And they were <48 <46 a <46 that they were exceedingly
tight, even that they would hold water like unto a dish; and the bottom
thereof was tight like unto a <11 and the sides <10 were <10
like unto a <11 and the ends <11 were peaked; and the top <6
was <18 like unto a <17 and the length <11 was the <4 of a
tree; and the door thereof, when it was shut, was <25 like unto a
dish.

2:18 And it came to pass that the <156 of <156 cried unto the Lord,
saying: O <4 I have performed the work <154 thou hast commanded me,
and I have made the <169 <162 as thou hast directed me.

2:19 And <488 O <31 in them there is no light; whither <247 we
steer? And also we <7 perish, for in them we cannot breathe, save it
is the air <54 is in them; therefore we <20 perish.

2:20 And the Lord said unto the <88 of Jared: Behold, thou <352
make a hole in the top, and also in the bottom; and when thou <16
suffer for air thou <6 unstop the hole and receive air. And if it be
so that the <211 come in upon thee, <96 ye <61 stop the hole,
that ye may not perish in the flood.

2:21 And it came to pass that the <73 of <161 did so, <138 as
the Lord had commanded.

2:22 And he <176 again unto the Lord <176 O <145 behold I have
done even as thou hast <177 me; and I have prepared the vessels
for my people, and <22 <166 is no <332 in them. <125 O <32
wilt thou <111 that we <88 cross this great <99 in darkness?

2:23 And the Lord said unto the <81 of <154 What will ye that I
should do that ye may have <44 in your vessels? For <127 ye <202
have windows, for they will be dashed in pieces; neither <51 ye take
fire with you, for ye <9 not go by the <33 of fire.

2:24 For <36 ye <15 be as a whale in the midst of the sea; for
the mountain waves <16 dash upon you. Nevertheless, I will bring you
up <147 out of the depths of the sea; for the winds have gone forth
out of my mouth, and also the rains and the floods have I sent forth.

2:25 And <64 I prepare you against these things; for ye <107
<147 this <147 deep save I <15 you <15 the <68 of the sea,
and the <53 <321 have gone forth, and the <45 <7 <83 come.
Therefore what will ye that I <157 <30 for you that ye may have
<127 when ye are swallowed up in the <94 of the sea?

Ether Chapter 3

3:1 And it came to pass that the <204 of Jared, (now the number of
the <252 <58 had been <258 was eight) went <123 unto the
mount, <12 they called the mount Shelem, because of its exceeding
height, and did molten out of a rock sixteen small stones; and they
were white and clear, even as transparent glass; and he did carry them
in his hands upon the top of the <48 and <338 <191 unto the <303
<339

3:2 O <8 thou hast said that we must be encompassed about by the
floods. Now <182 O <17 and do not be angry with thy servant
<82 of his weakness before thee; for we know that thou art holy and
dwellest in the heavens, and that we are unworthy <20 <20 <26
of the fall our natures have become evil continually; nevertheless, O
<50 thou hast given us a commandment that we must call upon <474
that from thee we may <495 <450 to our desires.

3:3 <408 O <30 thou hast smitten us <49 of our iniquity, and
hast driven us <246 and for <276 many years we have been in the
wilderness; <60 thou hast been merciful unto us. O <35 look
upon me in pity, and turn away thine anger from this thy <469 and
<457 not that they <284 go <222 across this raging deep in
darkness; but <485 <52 things <229 I have <218 out of the rock.

3:4 And I know, O <52 that thou hast all power, and can do whatsoever
thou wilt for the benefit of man; therefore touch <38 stones, O <23
with thy finger, and <333 them that they may shine <63 in
<59 and they <71 <8 <8 unto us in the <306 <65 we
have prepared, that we may have <354 while we <20 <402 the sea.

3:5 <158 O <48 thou canst do this. We know that thou art able to
show <42 <424 <82 <39 looks <315 unto the understanding of
men.

3:6 And it came to pass that when the <376 of Jared had said <94
words, <286 the Lord stretched <36 his hand and touched the stones
one by one with his finger. And the veil was taken from off the eyes of
the <38 of <414 and he saw the finger of the Lord; and it was as
the <10 of a man, like unto flesh and blood; and the <28 of
<67 fell down <314 the <112 for he was struck with fear.

3:7 And the Lord saw that the <25 of <24 had fallen to the earth;
and the Lord said unto him: Arise, why hast thou fallen?

3:8 And he saith unto the Lord: I saw the <69 of the <53 and I
feared lest he should smite me; for I knew not that the Lord had <84
and blood.

3:9 And the Lord said unto him: Because of thy faith thou hast seen
that I <217 take upon me <28 and <112 and never has man come
<110 me with such exceeding <25 as thou hast; for were it not so ye
could not have seen my <178 Sawest thou more than this?

3:10 And he answered: Nay; <90 show thyself unto me.

3:11 And the Lord said unto him: Believest thou the words <257 I <69
speak?

3:12 And he <32 Yea, <32 I know that thou speakest the truth,
for thou art a God of <8 and <302 not lie.

3:13 And when he had said <273 <272 <272 the Lord showed himself
unto him, and said: <131 thou knowest <15 <420 ye are redeemed
from the fall; <393 ye are brought back into my presence;
<9 I show myself unto you.

3:14 <361 I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world
to redeem my people. <18 I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the
Son. In me <116 all mankind have life, and that eternally, even they
who <12 believe on my name; and they <7 become my sons and my
daughters.

3:15 And <209 have I <106 <76 unto man whom I have created, for
<13 has man believed in me as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are
created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were <10 in the
beginning <14 mine own image.

3:16 <98 this body, <204 ye now <163 is the body of my spirit;
and man have I <31 <27 the body of my <12 and even as I
appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I <10 unto my people in
the flesh.

3:17 And now, as I, Moroni, said I <298 not make a full account of
<211 <211 <66 are written <198 it sufficeth me to say that
<175 <129 <235 unto this man in the spirit, even <71 the manner
and in the likeness of the same body even as he <24 <24 unto the
Nephites.

3:18 And he ministered unto him even as he <6 unto the
Nephites; and all this, that this man might know that he was God,
because of the many great works <78 the Lord had <46 unto him.

3:19 And <18 of the knowledge of this man he <108 not be kept from
beholding within the veil; and he saw the <494 of Jesus, which, when
he saw, he fell with fear; for he knew that it was the <19 of the
Lord; and he had <458 no longer, for he knew, nothing doubting.

3:20 Wherefore, having this perfect <62 of God, he <61 not be
kept from <60 the <60 <165 he saw Jesus; and he did minister
unto him.

3:21 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto the brother of Jared:
<267 thou shalt not suffer <205 <205 <127 ye have seen and heard
to go forth unto the world, until the time cometh that I <357 glorify
my name in the flesh; wherefore, ye <10 treasure up the <34 <34
ye have seen and heard, and show it to no man.

3:22 And <320 when ye <26 come unto me, ye <5 write them and
<5 seal them up, that no one can interpret them; for ye <12 <17
them in a language that they cannot be read.

3:23 And <42 <97 two stones will I give unto thee, and ye <28
seal them up also with the <80 <80 ye <11 write.

3:24 For <29 the <42 <12 ye <12 <51 I have confounded;
wherefore I will cause in my own due time that <49 <48 <18
magnify to the eyes of men <10 <42 <30 ye <12 <42

3:25 And when the Lord had said <16 words, he <296 unto the <187
of Jared all the inhabitants of the earth <30 had been, and also all
that would be; and he withheld them not from his sight, even unto the
ends of the earth.

3:26 For he had said unto him in times before, that if he <34 believe
in him that he <281 show unto him all things—it should be shown unto
him; <284 the Lord <15 not withhold anything from him, for he
knew that the Lord <13 show him all things.

3:27 And the Lord said unto him: Write <109 <125 and seal them up;
and I will show them in mine own due time unto the children of men.

3:28 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that he <76
seal up the two <178 <138 he had received, and show them not, <319
the Lord <19 show them unto the <43 of men.

Ether Chapter 4

4:1 And the Lord <44 the <183 of <182 to go down out of the
mount from the presence of the Lord, and <248 the <99 <56 he had
seen; and they were forbidden to come unto the <52 of men <64
after that he <65 be lifted up upon the cross; and for this <274
did king Mosiah keep them, that they <19 not come unto the world
<31 <30 Christ <10 show himself unto his people.

4:2 And <13 <13 truly had <272 <14 unto his people he
<95 that they <25 be made manifest.

4:3 And now, <24 that, they have all dwindled in unbelief; and there
is none save it be the Lamanites, and they have rejected the gospel of
Christ; <245 I am <43 that I <43 hide them up again in
the <295

4:4 Behold, I have written upon <237 plates the very <141 <141 the
<165 of <165 saw; and <55 never were greater <13 made manifest
than those <18 were made <7 unto the <21 of Jared.

4:5 Wherefore the Lord hath <61 me to <182 <486 and I have
<51 them. And he <13 me that I <75 seal them up; and he
also hath <13 that I <12 seal up the interpretation thereof;
<458 I have sealed up the interpreters, according to the
commandment of the Lord.

4:6 For the Lord said unto me: They <460 not go forth unto the
Gentiles <199 the day that they <13 repent of their iniquity, and
become clean before the <36

4:7 And in that day that they <22 exercise faith in me, saith the
<286 even as the <120 of <141 did, that they may <34 sanctified
in me, then will I <138 unto them the <151 <146 the <22 of
<23 saw, even to the unfolding unto them all my revelations, <43
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of the heavens and of the
earth, and all <37 that in them are.

4:8 And he that will contend against the word of the <79 let him be
accursed; and he that <96 deny <235 things, let him be <11 for
unto them will I show no <233 <14 <66 <65 <278 for I am
he who speaketh.

4:9 And at my command the <73 are opened and are shut; and at my
word the earth <50 shake; and at my <20 the inhabitants thereof
<10 pass away, even so as by fire.

4:10 And he that believeth not my words <4 not my disciples; and
if it so be that I do not speak, judge ye; for ye <38 know that it is
I that speaketh, at the last day.

4:11 But he that <39 <117 <148 <185 I have spoken, him will I
visit with the manifestations of my Spirit, and he <40 know and bear
record. For because of my Spirit he <12 know that <34 <34 are
true; for it persuadeth men to do good.

4:12 And whatsoever thing <12 men to do good is of me; for good
cometh of none save it be of me. I am the same that leadeth men to all
good; he that will not believe my <130 will not <5 me—that I am;
and he that will not <10 me will not <4 the <266 who sent
me. For behold, I am the Father, I am the light, and the life, and the
truth of the world.

4:13 Come unto me, O ye Gentiles, and I will show unto you the <253
<254 the knowledge <153 is hid up <133 of unbelief.

4:14 Come unto me, O ye house of Israel, and it <145 be made <367
unto you how great <150 the <79 hath laid up for you, from the
foundation of the world; and it hath not come unto you, <48 of
<49

4:15 Behold, when ye <42 rend that veil of unbelief <69 doth cause
you to remain in your awful state of wickedness, and hardness of heart,
and blindness of mind, then <29 the <65 and marvelous <67 <29
have been hid up from the <65 of the world from you—yea, when ye
<23 call upon the <87 in my name, with a broken heart and a
contrite spirit, then <18 ye know that the <19 hath remembered the
covenant <46 he made unto your fathers, O <135 of Israel.

4:16 And then <27 my revelations <19 I have caused to be written by
my servant John be unfolded in the eyes of all the people. Remember,
when ye see <310 <193 ye <32 know that the time is at hand that
they <11 be made <182 in very deed.

4:17 Therefore, when ye <14 receive this record ye may know that the
work of the <92 has commenced upon all the face of the land.

4:18 <30 repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me, and
<307 in my gospel, and be baptized in my name; for he that <427
and is <11 <59 be saved; but he that <11 not <8 be
damned; and signs <6 follow them that <36 in my name.

4:19 And blessed is he that is found faithful unto my name at the last
day, for he <30 be lifted up to dwell in the kingdom prepared for him
from the <229 of the <361 And behold it is I that hath spoken
it. Amen.

Ether Chapter 5

5:1 And now I, Moroni, have <196 the <433 <205 were commanded me,
according to my memory; and I have told you the <286 <16 I have
sealed up; therefore touch them not in order that ye may translate; for
that <506 is forbidden you, except by and by it <92 be wisdom in
God.

5:2 And <464 ye may be privileged that ye may show the plates unto
those who <26 assist to bring forth this work;

5:3 And unto three <14 they be shown by the power of God; wherefore
they <12 know of a surety that <281 <88 are true.

5:4 And in the mouth of <32 witnesses <21 <16 <16 be
established; and the testimony of three, and this work, in the <117
<18 be <50 <64 the <50 of God and also his word, of <15 the
Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost bear record—and all this <28
stand as a <43 against the <430 at the last day.

5:5 And if it so be that they <310 and come unto the <330 in the
name of Jesus, they <37 be received into the <245 of God.

5:6 And now, if I have no authority for <102 <399 judge ye; for ye
<27 know that I have <14 when ye <8 see me, and we <5
<77 before God at the last day. <268

<268 <268 6

6:1 And now I, <268 proceed to give the <416 of Jared and his
brother.

6:2 For it came to pass after the Lord had <327 the stones <143
the brother of <26 had carried up into the mount, the <10 of
<11 came down out of the <11 and he did put <180 the <30 into
the vessels <34 were prepared, one in each end thereof; and <279
they did give light unto the vessels.

6:3 And thus the Lord caused <32 to shine in darkness, to give <20
unto men, women, and children, that they might not cross the great
waters in darkness.

6:4 And it came to pass that when they had <102 all manner of food,
that thereby they <31 subsist upon the water, and also food for their
flocks and herds, and whatsoever beast or animal or fowl that they
should carry with them—and it came to pass that when they had done all
<218 <320 they got aboard of <36 <121 or barges, and set <132
into the sea, commending themselves unto the Lord <16 God.

6:5 And it came to pass that the Lord God <124 that there <55 be a
furious wind blow upon the face of the waters, towards the promised
land; and thus they were tossed upon the waves of the sea <264 the
wind.

6:6 And it came to pass that they were many times buried in the depths
of the sea, because of the mountain <34 <213 broke upon them, and
also the <174 and terrible tempests <12 were <77 by the
fierceness of the <49

6:7 And it came to pass that when they were <48 in the deep <100
was no water that could hurt <44 <126 <142 being tight like unto
a dish, and also they were <10 like unto the ark of Noah; therefore
when they were encompassed about by many <241 they did cry unto the
Lord, and he did bring them <178 again upon the top of the waters.

6:8 And it came to pass that the wind did never cease to blow <162
the <163 land while they were upon the waters; and thus they were
driven <42 <164 the <114

6:9 And they did sing praises unto the Lord; yea, the <384 of <383
did sing <12 unto the <75 and he did thank and praise the Lord
all the day long; and when the night came, they did not <69 to <18
the Lord.

6:10 And thus they were <64 forth; and no monster of the sea <158
break <159 neither whale that <7 mar them; and they did have <396
continually, whether it was above the <182 or under the water.

6:11 And thus they were <43 forth, three hundred and forty and four
days upon the <21

6:12 And they did land upon the shore of the <146 land. And when
they had set <224 feet upon the shores of the <15 land they bowed
<366 down upon the face of the land, and did humble <11
<164 the <140 and did shed tears of joy <9 the <9 <314 of
the multitude of his tender mercies over them.

6:13 And it came to pass that they went <200 upon the face of the
<48 and began to till the earth.

6:14 And <199 had four sons; and they were called Jacom, and Gilgah,
and Mahah, and Orihah.

6:15 And the <223 of <24 also begat sons and daughters.

6:16 And the friends of <14 and his <19 were in number <322
twenty and two souls; and they also <28 sons and daughters <103
they came to the <136 <459 and <350 they <79 to be many.

6:17 And they were taught to walk humbly <26 the <290 and they were
also <12 from on high.

6:18 And it came to pass that they <38 to spread upon the face of the
<128 and to multiply and to till the earth; and they did wax strong in
the <219

6:19 And the <99 of <104 <36 to be old, and saw that he must
soon go down to the grave; wherefore he said unto Jared: Let us gather
together our people that we may <130 <320 that we may know of them
what they will desire of us <105 we go down to our graves.

6:20 And accordingly the <33 were gathered together. Now the <35
of the sons and the <159 of the <79 of <79 were <176 and
two <177 and the <21 of sons and <18 of <15 were twelve,
he having four sons.

6:21 And it came to pass that they did <26 <336 people; and after
that they had numbered <91 they did <83 of them the things which
they would that they should do <93 they went down to <30 <93

6:22 And it came to pass that the <97 desired of them that they
<27 anoint one of <24 sons to be a king over <350

6:23 And now behold, this was grievous unto <12 And the <114 of
<100 said unto them: Surely this thing leadeth into captivity.

6:24 But <15 said unto his brother: Suffer them that they may have a
king. And <299 he said unto <31 Choose ye out from among our
sons a king, even whom ye will.

6:25 And it came to pass that they chose even the firstborn of the
<70 of Jared; and his name was Pagag. And it came to pass that he
refused and <144 not be <113 <61 And the <128 <8 that his
father <127 constrain him, but his <6 <11 not; and he commanded
them that they <15 <15 no man to be <31 <31

6:26 And it came to pass that they <72 all the brothers of Pagag, and
they <37 not.

6:27 And it came to pass that neither <13 the sons of Jared, even all
save it were one; and Orihah was anointed to be king over the people.

6:28 And he <375 to reign, and the <95 <6 to prosper; and they
became exceedingly rich.

6:29 And it came to pass that <192 died, and his <144 also.

6:30 And it came to pass that <56 did walk <479 <281 the Lord,
and did remember how great <299 the Lord had done for his father, and
also <491 his <62 how <16 <16 the Lord had done for <139
fathers.

Ether Chapter 7

7:1 And it came to pass that <54 did execute judgment upon the land
in righteousness all his days, whose days were <98 many.

7:2 And he begat sons and daughters; yea, he <6 thirty and one,
<273 whom were <428 and three <411

7:3 And it came to pass that he also <24 Kib in his old age. And it
came to pass that Kib reigned in his stead; and Kib <20 Corihor.

7:4 And when Corihor was <53 and two years old he rebelled against
his <128 and went over and dwelt in the land of Nehor; and he <33
sons and daughters, and they <197 <99 fair; wherefore <36
drew away many <151 <477 him.

7:5 And when he had gathered together an army he came up unto the land
of Moron where the king dwelt, and took him captive, <494 brought to
pass the saying of the <230 of <236 that they <292 be <15 into
<442

7:6 Now the land of Moron, <37 the king <37 was near the land
<38 is called Desolation by the Nephites.

7:7 And it came to pass that Kib <112 in captivity, and his <93
under <101 his son, until he <110 <110 old; nevertheless
Kib <123 Shule in his old age, while he was yet in <67

7:8 And it came to pass that <21 was angry with his brother; and
<8 waxed strong, and <40 mighty as to the strength of a man; and
he was also <13 in judgment.

7:9 Wherefore, he came to the hill Ephraim, and he did molten out of
the hill, and made swords out of steel for those whom he had drawn away
with him; and <194 he had armed them with <21 he returned to the
city Nehor and gave battle unto his <173 Corihor, by <147 means he
obtained the kingdom and restored it unto his father Kib.

7:10 And now because of the thing <24 <105 had done, his <17
bestowed upon him the kingdom; therefore he <467 to reign in the stead
of his father.

7:11 And it came to pass that he did <398 <398 in righteousness;
and he did spread his <64 upon all the face of the land, for the
<205 had become <199 numerous.

7:12 And it came to pass that <71 also <208 many sons and daughters.

7:13 And <229 repented of the many evils <90 he had done;
<342 <24 gave him power in his kingdom.

7:14 And it came to pass that <29 had many sons and <40 And
<450 the sons of <12 there was one <480 name was Noah.

7:15 And it came to pass that Noah <418 <418 Shule, the king,
and also his <148 <180 and drew away Cohor his brother, and also
all his brethren and many of the people.

7:16 And he gave <209 unto <85 the <35 in <95 he did obtain the
land of their first inheritance; and he <298 a king over that part of
the land.

7:17 And it came to pass that he gave <41 again unto <77 the
king; and he took <7 the <49 and carried him away captive into
Moron.

7:18 And it came to pass as he was about to put him to death, the sons
of <82 crept into the house of Noah by night and slew him, and broke
down the door of the prison and <478 out <94 father, and placed
him upon his throne in his own <197

7:19 <383 the son of Noah did build up his <267 in his stead;
<455 they did not gain <224 any more over <64 the <97 and
the <276 who were <482 the <322 of <13 the king did prosper
<286 and wax great.

7:20 And the country was divided; and <234 were two kingdoms, the
<53 of <138 and the <5 of Cohor, the son of <245

7:21 And <10 the son of Noah, caused that his <58 should give
<175 unto <29 in <214 <60 did beat them and did slay Cohor.

7:22 And now <256 had a son who was called Nimrod; and Nimrod gave up
the <57 of <16 unto <35 and he did gain favor in the eyes of
Shule; <349 <45 did bestow great favors upon him, and he did do
in the <31 of <16 according to his desires.

7:23 And also in the <136 of <15 <117 came prophets <359 the
people, who were sent from the Lord, prophesying that the wickedness
and idolatry of the <108 was bringing a curse upon the <453 and they
<118 be destroyed if they did not repent.

7:24 And it came to pass that the <30 did revile <387 the
prophets, and did mock them. And it came to pass that king <71 did
execute judgment <20 all those who did <26 <6 the prophets.

7:25 And he did <18 a law throughout all the <68 <176 gave <254
unto the <102 that they <74 go whithersoever they would; and by
this cause the <66 were <312 unto repentance.

7:26 And because the <12 did repent of <324 iniquities and
idolatries the Lord did spare them, and they began to <281 <405 in
the <423 And it came to pass that <90 begat sons and daughters in
his old age.

7:27 And <175 were no more wars in the days of <218 and he
remembered the <219 things that the Lord had done for his fathers in
<178 them across the <16 deep into the promised land; <245
he did <125 <143 in righteousness all his days.

Ether Chapter 8

8:1 And it came to pass that he <79 Omer, and Omer reigned in his
stead. And Omer <11 Jared; and Jared <4 sons and daughters.

8:2 And <10 rebelled <185 his <457 and came and dwelt in the
land of Heth. And it came to pass that he did flatter many <283
<163 of his cunning words, until he had gained the half of the
<483

8:3 And when he had <15 the half of the <337 he gave <404 unto
his <58 and he did carry away his father into captivity, and did
make him serve in captivity;

8:4 And now, in the days of the reigns of Omer he was in captivity the
half of his <145 And it came to pass that he <120 sons and <214
<377 whom were Esrom and Coriantumr;

8:5 And they were exceedingly angry <104 of the doings of <136
<268 brother, insomuch that they did raise an army and gave <91
unto Jared. And it came to pass that they did give <13 unto him by
night.

8:6 And it came to pass that when they had slain the army of <49 they
were about to slay him also; and he plead with them that they would not
slay him, and he <7 give up the <157 unto his father. And it came
to pass that they did grant unto him his life.

8:7 And now <51 became <109 sorrowful <109 of the loss of
the kingdom, for he had set his heart upon the <44 and upon the
glory of the world.

8:8 Now the daughter of <37 being <37 expert, and seeing the
sorrows of her <222 thought to devise a plan whereby she could
redeem the <40 unto her <84

8:9 Now the <35 of <35 was <35 fair. And it came to pass
that she did talk with her <40 and said unto him: Whereby hath my
<264 so much sorrow? Hath he not read the record <509 our <410
<491 <408 the <408 deep? Behold, is <443 not an account
concerning them of old, that they by <228 secret plans did obtain
kingdoms and <24 glory?

8:10 And now, therefore, let my <52 send for Akish, the son of
Kimnor; and behold, I am fair, and I will dance before him, and I will
please him, that he will desire me to wife; <470 if he shall
<9 of thee that ye <7 give unto him me to wife, then <8 ye
say: I will give her if ye will bring unto me the head of my <130
the king.

8:11 And now Omer was a friend to Akish; wherefore, when <164 had sent
for <89 the <173 of <9 danced <80 him that she pleased
him, <350 that he desired her to wife. And it came to pass that he
said unto Jared: Give her unto me to <17

8:12 And <38 said unto him: I will give her unto you, if ye will
<86 unto me the head of my <86 the <85

8:13 And it came to pass that Akish gathered in unto the house of <41
all his kinsfolk, and said unto them: Will ye swear unto me that ye
will be faithful unto me in the thing <242 I <151 <165 of you?

8:14 And it came to pass that they all sware unto him, by the God of
heaven, and also by the heavens, and also by the earth, and by <258
heads, that whoso should vary from the assistance <49 <82 <143
<9 lose his head; and <15 <6 divulge whatsoever <63 <13
made known unto them, the same <12 lose his <430

8:15 And it came to pass that thus they did agree with Akish. And <29
did administer unto them the oaths <51 were given by them of old who
also sought power, <12 had been handed down even from Cain, who was a
murderer from the beginning.

8:16 And they were kept up by the power of the devil to <49
these <48 unto the people, to keep them in darkness, to help such as
<51 <23 to gain <54 and to murder, and to plunder, and to lie,
and to commit all manner of wickedness and whoredoms.

8:17 And it was the <299 of <220 who put it into his heart to
search up <60 things of old; and <16 put it into the <15 of
<335 <335 <129 administered it unto his kindred and friends,
leading them away by fair promises to do <177 <177 he desired.

8:18 And it came to pass that they formed a <473 combination, even as
they of old; <151 combination is most abominable and wicked above all,
in the sight of God;

8:19 For the Lord worketh not in <33 combinations, neither doth he
will that man <226 shed blood, but in all <96 hath forbidden it,
from the beginning of man.

8:20 And now I, Moroni, do not write the <145 of <288 <181 and
<42 for it hath been made <271 unto me that they are had
among all <197 and they are had <7 the Lamanites.

8:21 And they have caused the destruction of this people of whom I am
now speaking, and also the <14 of the <14 of Nephi.

8:22 And <151 nation <389 uphold such <106 <64 to
get <237 and gain, until they <13 spread over the nation, behold,
they <8 be destroyed; for the Lord will not suffer that the blood of
his saints, <165 <17 be shed by <365 <5 always cry unto him from
the ground for vengeance upon them and yet he avenge them not.

8:23 Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is wisdom in God that <261 <165
<173 be shown unto you, that thereby ye may repent of your sins, and
<65 not that <21 murderous combinations <57 get <223 you, <67
are built up to get <103 and gain—and the work, yea, even the work of
<135 come upon you, yea, even the sword of the justice of the
Eternal God <38 fall upon you, to your overthrow and <24 if
ye <12 <57 <55 <76 to be.

8:24 <94 the Lord commandeth you, when ye <17 see <17 <17
come <212 you that ye <10 awake to a sense of your awful situation,
because of this <187 <318 <88 <16 be <22 you; or wo be
unto it, <16 of the <174 of them who have been slain; for they cry
from the dust for <168 upon it, and also upon those who <122 it
up.

8:25 For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth it up seeketh to
<106 the freedom of all lands, nations, and countries; and it
bringeth to pass the <120 of all <313 for it is <44 up by
the devil, who is the father of all lies; even that same liar who
beguiled our first parents, yea, even that same liar who hath <332
man to commit murder from the beginning; who hath hardened the hearts
of men that they have murdered the prophets, and stoned <286 and cast
them out from the beginning.

8:26 <181 I, <414 am commanded to <415 <179 <179 that evil
may be done away, and that the time may come that Satan may have no
<258 upon the <56 of the children of men, but that they may be
persuaded to do good continually, that they may come unto the fountain
of all righteousness and be saved.

Ether Chapter 9

9:1 And now I, <73 proceed with my record. Therefore, <404 it
came to pass that <226 of the <242 <334 of Akish and his
friends, <18 they did <193 the kingdom of Omer.

9:2 Nevertheless, the Lord was merciful unto Omer, and also to his sons
and to his daughters who did not seek his destruction.

9:3 And the Lord warned Omer in a dream that he <410 depart out of
the land; wherefore Omer departed out of the land with his family, and
traveled many days, and came over and passed by the hill of Shim, and
came over by the place where the Nephites were destroyed, and from
thence eastward, and came to a <15 <351 was called Ablom, by the
seashore, and there he pitched his tent, and also his sons and his
daughters, and all his household, save it were Jared and his family.

9:4 And it came to pass that <14 was anointed king over the <323
by the hand of wickedness; and he gave unto <168 his daughter to wife.

9:5 And it came to pass that <15 sought the life of his
father-in-law; and he applied unto <403 whom he had sworn by the oath
of the ancients, and they obtained the head of his father-in-law, as he
sat upon his throne, giving audience to his people.

9:6 For so great had been the spreading of this wicked and <245
society that it had corrupted the <313 of all the people; therefore
<106 was <371 upon his <41 and <81 reigned in his stead.

9:7 And it came to pass that <15 began to be jealous of his son,
<33 he shut him up in prison, and kept him upon little or no food
until he had suffered death.

9:8 And now the brother of him that <13 death, (and his name was
Nimrah) was angry with his <485 <339 of that <228 his <6 had
done unto his brother.

9:9 And it came to pass that Nimrah gathered together a small number of
men, and fled out of the land, and came over and dwelt with <364

9:10 And it came to pass that <108 begat other sons, and they won the
<146 of the <242 notwithstanding they had <204 unto him to do all
manner of iniquity according to that <80 he desired.

9:11 Now the people of <40 were desirous for gain, even as <7 was
<8 for power; wherefore, the sons of <10 did offer them money,
by <35 means they drew away the more part of the <36 after them.

9:12 And <352 <190 to be a war between the sons of <35 and Akish,
<32 lasted for the space of many years, yea, unto the destruction of
nearly all the <39 of the kingdom, yea, even all, save it were
thirty souls, and they who fled with the house of <145

9:13 Wherefore, Omer was restored again to the land of his inheritance.

9:14 And it came to pass that Omer <78 to be old; nevertheless, in
his old age he <171 Emer; and he <410 Emer to be king to reign in
his <305

9:15 And <117 that he had <20 Emer to be king he saw peace in the
land for the <110 of two <110 and he died, having seen exceedingly
many days, <127 were full of sorrow. And it came to pass that Emer did
<55 in his stead, and did fill the steps of his father.

9:16 And the Lord <95 <114 to take the curse from off the <283 and
the <137 of Emer did prosper <55 under the <40 of <106 and
in the <74 of sixty and two years they had become <19 strong,
insomuch that they became <7 rich—

9:17 Having all <285 of fruit, and of grain, and of silks, and of
fine linen, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things;

9:18 And also all <31 of cattle, of oxen, and cows, and of sheep,
and of swine, and of goats, and also many <357 kinds of animals <140
were useful for the food of man.

9:19 And they also had horses, and asses, and <302 were elephants and
cureloms and cumoms; all of <31 were <30 unto man, and more
especially the <18 and <17 and cumoms.

9:20 And thus the Lord did pour out his blessings upon this <159 <31
was choice above all <72 lands; and he commanded that whoso should
possess the land <5 <4 it unto the Lord, or they <8 be
destroyed when they were ripened in iniquity; for upon such, saith the
Lord: I will pour out the fulness of my wrath.

9:21 And Emer did execute judgment in righteousness all his <268 and
he <322 many sons and daughters; and he <7 Coriantum, and he
<310 Coriantum to <232 in his <326

9:22 And <326 he had <15 <15 to <15 in his stead he lived
four <319 and he saw <333 in the land; yea, and he even saw the Son
of Righteousness, and did rejoice and glory in his day; and he died in
peace.

9:23 And it came to pass that <52 did walk in the <334 of his
father, and did build many mighty cities, and did administer that <169
was good unto his <487 in all his days. And it came to pass that he
had no children even until he was <320 old.

9:24 And it came to pass that his wife <418 being an hundred and two
<352 old. And it came to pass that <75 took to wife, in his old
age, a young maid, and <161 sons and <167 wherefore he <139
<53 he was an <37 and forty and two <38 old.

9:25 And it came to pass that he <30 Com, and Com reigned in his
stead; and he <7 <28 and nine <175 and he <18 Heth; and he
also <6 <286 sons and daughters.

9:26 And the <127 had spread <473 over all the face of the <313 and
<356 <485 <12 to be an <126 great wickedness upon the face
of the <18 and Heth <17 to embrace the secret plans <22 of old,
to destroy his father.

9:27 And it came to pass that he did dethrone his <203 for he slew
him with his own sword; and he did <275 in his <290

9:28 And <68 came prophets in the land again, crying repentance unto
them—that they must prepare the way of the Lord or <21 <379 come a
curse upon the face of the <301 yea, even <14 <14 be a <100
famine, in <257 they <9 be <401 if they did not repent.

9:29 But the <140 believed not the words of the prophets, but they
cast them out; and some of them they cast into pits and left them to
perish. And it came to pass that they did all these things according to
the commandment of the king, Heth.

9:30 And it came to pass that <82 <168 to be a <83 dearth upon the
<180 and the inhabitants <13 to be <87 <197 fast
because of the dearth, for <26 was no rain upon the face of the
earth.

9:31 And <16 came forth poisonous serpents also upon the face of the
<44 and did poison many people. And it came to pass that their flocks
<55 to flee before the <29 serpents, towards the land
southward, <155 was called by the Nephites Zarahemla.

9:32 And it came to pass that <56 were many of them <22 did perish
by the way; nevertheless, <13 were some <11 fled into the land
southward.

9:33 And it came to pass that the Lord did cause the <90 that they
<212 pursue them no more, but that they <8 hedge up the way that
the <214 could not pass, that whoso <14 attempt to pass might fall
by the <97 serpents.

9:34 And it came to pass that the <28 did follow the course of the
beasts, and did devour the carcasses of them <86 fell by the way,
<461 they had devoured them all. Now when the <31 saw that they
must <116 they <154 to repent of <161 iniquities and cry unto the
Lord.

9:35 And it came to pass that when they had humbled themselves
sufficiently <180 the Lord he did send rain upon the face of the
earth; and the <53 <46 to revive <383 and <163 <6 to be
fruit in the north countries, and in all the countries round about. And
the Lord did show <253 his power unto them in preserving them from
famine.

Ether Chapter 10

10:1 And it came to pass that Shez, who was a descendant of Heth—for
Heth had perished by the <413 and all his household save it were
Shez—wherefore, Shez <73 to build up again a broken <296

10:2 And it came to pass that Shez did remember the destruction of his
fathers, and he did <28 up a righteous kingdom; for he remembered
what the Lord had done in bringing Jared and his brother across the
deep; and he did walk in the ways of the Lord; and he begat sons and
daughters.

10:3 And his eldest son, whose name was <106 did rebel against him;
<326 Shez was smitten by the hand of a robber, <425 of his
exceeding riches, <252 brought peace <103 unto his father.

10:4 And it came to pass that his father did <94 up many cities upon
the face of the <428 and the <217 <138 <32 to spread over all the
face of the land. And Shez did live to an <486 old age; and he
<96 Riplakish. And he died, and Riplakish reigned in his stead.

10:5 And it came to pass that <15 did not do that <84 was right
in the sight of the Lord, for he did have many wives and concubines,
and did lay that upon men’s shoulders <26 was grievous to be borne;
yea, he did tax them with heavy taxes; and with the taxes he did <111
many spacious buildings.

10:6 And he did erect him an <94 beautiful throne; and he did
<22 many prisons, and <448 would not be subject unto <35 he did
cast into prison; and <14 was not able to pay <14 he did cast into

he did <26 to be refined in prison, and all manner of fine
workmanship he did <15 to be wrought in prison. And it came to pass
that he did afflict the <229 with his whoredoms and abominations.

descendants were driven out of the <275

10:9 And it came to pass after the <53 of many years, Morianton, (he
being a <465 of Riplakish) gathered together an army of outcasts,
and went <508 and gave battle unto the people; and he gained power
over many cities; and the war became <226 sore, and did last for
the <48 of many years; and he did gain <25 over all the <87 and
did establish himself king over all the <82

10:10 And <78 that he had established <16 king he did ease the
burden of the people, by <315 he did gain favor in the eyes of the
<13 and they did anoint him to be <250 king.

10:11 And he did do justice unto the <21 but not unto <48
<469 of his many whoredoms; wherefore he was cut off from the
presence of the Lord.

10:12 And it came to pass that Morianton built up many cities, and the

in gold and silver, and in raising grain, and in flocks, and herds, and

did bring him into captivity; and he did remain in captivity all his
days; and he <80 sons and daughters in captivity, and in his old age
he <13 Levi; and he <75

10:15 And it came to pass that Levi did serve in <39 <255 the
death of his father, for the <292 of <393 and two years. And he did
make war <77 the king of the <297 by <81 he did <477 unto
<236 the kingdom.

10:16 And <42 he had obtained unto <13 the kingdom he did that
<26 was right in the sight of the Lord; and the <230 did prosper in
the land; and he did live to a good old age, and <102 sons and

10:20 And they <431 a <10 city by the narrow neck of <35 by the
place where the sea divides the land.

10:21 And they did preserve the land southward for a wilderness, to get
game. And the whole face of the land northward was <68 with
inhabitants.

10:22 And they were <437 industrious, and they did buy and sell
and traffic one with another, that they might get gain.

10:23 And they did work in all manner of ore, and they did make gold,
and <506 and iron, and brass, and all <17 of metals; and they did
dig it out of the <223 <453 they did cast up mighty heaps of
earth to get ore, of <37 and of <37 and of <38 and of copper.
And they did work all <43 of fine work.

10:24 And they did have silks, and fine-twined linen; and they did work
all <22 of cloth, that they <100 clothe themselves from their
nakedness.

10:25 And they did make all <21 of tools to till the earth, both to
plow and to sow, to reap and to hoe, and also to thrash.

all <11 of work of <199 curious workmanship.

10:28 And never could be a <298 more blessed than were they, and more
prospered by the hand of the <340 And they were in a land that was
choice above all lands, for the Lord had spoken it.

10:29 And it came to pass that Lib did live many years, and <452 sons
and <452 and he also <8 Hearthom.

10:32 And it came to pass that Com drew away the half of the kingdom.
And he <112 over the half of the <110 forty and two years; and he

of many <138 during <271 time Com gained power over <18 and
obtained <6 over the <131 of the <52

they adopted the old plans, and administered oaths after the <291 of
the ancients, and sought again to destroy the <42

prevail <9 them.

11:1 And <62 came also in the days of Com many prophets, and
prophesied of the destruction of that great <336 except they should
repent, and turn unto the Lord, and forsake <387 murders and
wickedness.

11:2 And it came to pass that the prophets were rejected by the people,
and they fled unto Com for protection, for the <45 <101 to <100
<81

11:3 And they <64 unto Com many things; and he was <399 in
all the <165 of his <280

11:4 And he <292 to a good old age, and <250 Shiblom; and Shiblom
<232 in his stead. And the brother of <10 rebelled <134 him,
and <125 <187 to be an <459 <113 war in all the land.

11:5 And it came to pass that the <31 of <31 caused that all
the <108 who <82 of the <146 of the <100 <143 be
put to death;

11:6 And <51 was <47 calamity in all the land, for they had
testified that a <13 curse <28 come upon the <14 and also upon
the <150 and that <30 <14 be a <19 <50 among them,
such an one as never had been upon the face of the earth, and <197
bones <25 become as heaps of earth upon the face of the land <224
they <15 repent of <21 <215

11:7 And they hearkened not unto the voice of the <236 because of
<19 wicked combinations; wherefore, <67 <148 to be wars and
contentions in all the <87 and also many famines and pestilences,
insomuch that <21 was a <87 destruction, such an one as <84 had
been known upon the face of the earth; and all this came to pass in the
days of Shiblom.

11:8 And the <168 <59 to <87 of <68 iniquity; and inasmuch as
they did the Lord did have mercy on <282

11:9 And it came to pass that <212 was slain, and Seth was brought
into captivity, and did dwell in captivity all his <287

11:10 And it came to pass that Ahah, his son, did obtain the kingdom;
and he did reign over the <72 all his <28 And he did do all <455
of iniquity in his days, by <510 he did cause the shedding of much
blood; and few were his <28

11:11 And Ethem, being a descendant of <56 did <54 the <54
and he also did do that <37 was <190 in his <28

11:12 And it came to pass that in the days of Ethem <185 came many
<474 and <327 again unto the people; yea, they did prophesy
that the Lord would utterly <433 them from off the face of the <271
<266 they repented of <177 iniquities.

11:13 And it came to pass that the <123 hardened <15 hearts, and
<35 not hearken unto <8 words; and the <385 mourned and
withdrew from <335 the people.

11:14 And it came to pass that <82 did execute judgment in wickedness
all his days; and he <466 Moron. And it came to pass that Moron did
<182 in his stead; and <8 did that <133 was <133 before the
Lord.

11:15 And it came to pass that <129 arose a rebellion <65 the
<412 <350 of that secret combination <30 was built up to get
power and gain; and <24 <24 a mighty man <25 them in iniquity,
and gave battle unto Moron, in <27 he did overthrow the half of the
<207 and he did maintain the half of the kingdom for many years.

11:16 And it came to pass that <92 did <31 him, and did <238
the <23 again.

11:17 And it came to pass that <69 <69 another <69 man; and he
was a <267 of the brother of Jared.

11:18 And it came to pass that he did <47 <50 and <46 the
<78 <464 <7 dwelt in <364 all the remainder of his
<178 and he <178 Coriantor.

11:19 And it came to pass that Coriantor <25 in <25 all his
<306

11:20 And in the days of <17 <79 also came many <301 and
<302 of <492 and marvelous things, and cried repentance unto the
<184 and <291 they should <469 the Lord God <275 <247
<248 against them to <278 utter destruction;

11:21 And that the Lord God <19 send or bring forth <129 <306 to
possess the land, by his power, after the <431 by <198 he <480
<35 fathers.

11:22 And they did reject all the words of the <81 <250 of
<19 <251 society and <280 abominations.

11:23 And it came to pass that <106 <136 Ether, and he died,
having <130 in <130 all his <129

Ether Chapter 12

12:1 And it came to pass that the days of <16 were in the days of
Coriantumr; and Coriantumr was king over all the land.

12:2 And <21 was a prophet of the Lord; wherefore <8 came <118 in
the days of Coriantumr, and began to <466 unto the <163 for he
could not be restrained <104 of the Spirit of the Lord <131 was in
him.

12:3 For he did cry from the morning, even until the going down of the
sun, exhorting the <171 to believe in God unto <215 lest they
<211 be destroyed, saying unto them that by faith all things are
fulfilled—

12:4 Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a
better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, <79 hope
cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, <14 <244 make
them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to
glorify God.

12:5 And it came to pass that <152 did <142 <313 and <313
<82 unto the <147 <40 they did not believe, <145 they saw
them not.

12:6 And now, I, Moroni, <58 speak somewhat concerning these things;
I <8 show unto the world that <121 is <39 <36 are hoped for
and not seen; <418 dispute not <42 ye see not, for ye receive
no witness <173 <326 the trial of your faith.

12:7 For it was by <39 that Christ showed himself unto our fathers,
<23 he had risen from the dead; and he <15 not <16 unto them
<39 <16 they had <28 in him; <59 it must needs be that
some had <12 in him, for he <27 <26 not unto the world.

12:8 But <81 of the <19 of men he has shown <19 unto the
<206 and glorified the name of the Father, and prepared a way that
thereby others <230 be partakers of the heavenly gift, that they <9
hope for those <136 <136 they have not seen.

12:9 <259 ye may also have hope, and be <30 of the <29 if
ye will but have <136

12:10 Behold it was by <77 that they of old were called <118 the
holy order of God.

12:11 <45 by <20 was the law of Moses given. But in the gift
of his Son hath God <95 a more excellent way; and it is by <26
that it hath been fulfilled.

12:12 For if there be no <16 among the children of men God can do no
miracle <11 them; <181 he <169 not <151 <193 <75 their
<94

12:13 Behold, it was the <32 of Alma and Amulek that caused the
prison to tumble to the earth.

12:14 <23 it was the <23 of Nephi and Lehi that wrought the
change upon the Lamanites, that they were baptized with fire and with
the Holy Ghost.

12:15 <33 it was the <33 of Ammon and his brethren <192 <34
so <376 a <89 <89 the Lamanites.

12:16 Yea, and even all they who <19 miracles <2 them by
<439 even <222 who were before <322 and also <7 who were after.

12:17 And it was by <53 that the three disciples obtained a promise
that they should not taste of death; and they <13 not the <14
<145 <145 <145 <144

12:18 And neither at any time hath any <63 <65 <17 <17
<18 faith; wherefore they first believed in the Son of God.

12:19 And <203 were many whose <63 was so exceedingly strong, even
<86 <86 came, who could not be kept from within the veil, but
truly saw with <44 eyes the <330 <138 they had beheld with an eye
of <121 and they were glad.

12:20 And behold, we have seen in this record that one of <508 was the
brother of Jared; for so <172 was his <69 in God, that when God put
forth his finger he <70 not hide it from the sight of the <29 of
Jared, <440 of his word <70 he had spoken unto him, <6 word he
had <154 by <148

12:21 And <139 the <29 of Jared had <92 the <46 of the Lord,
<36 of the <175 <30 the <17 of <17 had <31 by
<106 the Lord <65 not withhold anything from his sight; <171
he <344 him all things, for he <16 no longer be kept without the
veil.

12:22 And it is by <110 that my fathers have <44 the <53 that
<132 <163 <243 come unto <170 <306 through the Gentiles;
therefore the Lord hath commanded me, yea, even Jesus Christ.

12:23 And I said unto him: <91 the Gentiles will mock at <36
<68 <98 of our weakness in writing; for Lord thou hast made us
mighty in word by <102 but thou hast not made us <11 in <21
for thou hast made all this people that they <103 speak much, <40
of the Holy Ghost <140 thou hast given <469

12:24 And thou hast made us that we <25 write but little, <26 of
the awkwardness of our hands. <422 thou hast not made us <56 in
writing like unto the <179 of <224 for thou madest him that the
<135 <52 he wrote were <22 even as thou art, unto the
overpowering of man to read them.

12:25 Thou hast also made our words powerful and great, even that we
cannot <71 <85 wherefore, when we <5 we behold our weakness, and
stumble <81 of the placing of our words; and I fear lest the
<167 shall mock at our words.

12:26 And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto me, saying: Fools
mock, but they <26 mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek,
that they <13 take no advantage of your weakness;

12:27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them <256 weakness. I
give unto men <226 that they may be humble; and my <46 is
<47 for all men that humble themselves <468 me; for if they
<8 <8 <8 me, and have <308 in me, then will I make
weak <171 become strong unto <157

12:28 <203 I will show unto the <123 <62 <56 and I will
show unto them that <277 hope and charity bringeth unto me—the
fountain of all righteousness.

12:29 And I, Moroni, having heard <318 words, was comforted, and said:
O <332 thy righteous will be done, for I know that thou workest unto
the children of men according to <59 faith;

12:30 For the <264 of <443 said unto the mountain Zerin, Remove—and
it was removed. And if he had not had <111 it would not have moved;
<452 thou <45 <491 men have <500

12:31 For thus didst thou manifest thyself unto thy disciples; for
<19 they had <108 and did <367 in thy name, thou <20 show
<20 unto them in great power.

12:32 And I also remember that thou hast said that thou hast prepared a
house for man, yea, even among the mansions of thy Father, in <351 man
might have a more excellent hope; <81 man must hope, or he <331
receive an inheritance in the place <23 thou hast prepared.

12:33 And again, I <57 that thou hast said that thou hast loved
the world, even unto the laying down of thy life for the <11 that
thou mightest take it again to prepare a <45 for the <181 of men.

12:34 And now I know that this love <61 thou hast had for the
<21 of men is charity; <409 except men <348 have <253
they <89 inherit that <40 <24 thou hast <126 in the <119
of thy Father.

12:35 Wherefore, I know by this thing <21 thou hast said, that if the
<303 have not charity, <443 of our <450 that thou wilt
prove them, and take away <260 talent, yea, even that <30 they have
received, and give unto them who <70 have more abundantly.

12:36 And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he <267
give unto the <58 grace, that they <196 have charity.

12:37 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: If they have not
<121 it mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been faithful; <136
thy garments <67 be made clean. And <100 thou hast seen thy
<411 thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the
<154 <103 I have <154 in the <154 of my <153

12:38 And now I, <416 bid farewell unto the Gentiles, yea, and also
unto my brethren whom I love, until we <61 meet <493 the
judgment-seat of Christ, where all men <11 know that my <77 are
not spotted with your blood.

12:39 And then <18 ye know that I have seen Jesus, and that he hath
talked with me face to face, and that he told me in plain humility,
even as a man telleth another in mine own language, concerning <499
things;

12:40 And only a few have I written, <138 of my <135 in writing.

12:41 And now, I <202 commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the
prophets and apostles have <29 that the grace of God the <416
and also the Lord <22 <117 and the Holy Ghost, <164 beareth
record of <281 may be and abide in you forever. Amen.

Ether Chapter 13

13:1 And now I, <174 proceed to finish my <29 <95 the
destruction of the people of whom I have been <87

13:2 For behold, they rejected all the words of Ether; for he truly
told them of all things, from the beginning of man; and that after the
waters had receded from off the face of this land it became a choice
land above all other lands, a chosen land of the Lord; wherefore the
Lord <142 have that all men should serve him who dwell upon the face
thereof;

13:3 And that it was the <297 of the New Jerusalem, <137 <25 come
down out of heaven, and the holy sanctuary of the Lord.

13:4 Behold, <140 saw the days of <167 and he spake <133 a
New Jerusalem upon this land.

13:5 And he <15 also <16 the house of Israel, and the
<20 from whence Lehi <56 come—after it <3 be destroyed it
<5 be built up again, a holy city unto the <109 <407 it
could not be a new <31 for it had been in a time of old; but it
<32 be <32 up <32 and become a holy city of the <34 and it
<16 be <16 unto the <71 of Israel.

13:6 And that a New <45 <17 be <17 upon this land, unto the
remnant of the seed of Joseph, for <146 things there has been a type.

13:7 For as Joseph brought his father down into the land of Egypt, even
so he died there; <99 the Lord <18 a <41 of the seed of
<27 out of the land of <193 that he might be merciful unto the
seed of <17 that they <76 perish not, even as he was <16
unto the <55 of <16 that he <16 <16 not.

13:8 Wherefore, the <51 of the <116 of <17 <474 be <107 upon
this land; and it <9 be a land of their inheritance; and they <9
build up a holy city unto the Lord, like unto the <139 of old; and
they <19 no more be confounded, until the end come when the earth
<13 pass away.

13:9 And <147 <9 be a new heaven and a new earth; and they <11 be
like unto the old save the old have passed away, and all <175 have
<222 new.

13:10 And then cometh the New Jerusalem; and blessed are they who <362
therein, for it is they whose garments are white through the blood of
the Lamb; and they are they who are numbered among the <138 of the
seed of <231 who were of the <146 of <262

13:11 And then also <57 the <124 of old; and the inhabitants
thereof, <62 are they, for they have been washed in the <55 of
the <55 and they are they who were scattered and gathered in from the
four quarters of the earth, and from the north countries, and are
partakers of the fulfilling of the covenant <302 God made with <201
father, Abraham.

13:12 And when these <141 come, bringeth to pass the scripture <22
saith, <178 are they who were first, who <173 be last; and <11 are
they who were last, who <12 be first.

13:13 And I was about to write more, but I am forbidden; but great and
marvelous were the prophecies of Ether; but they esteemed him as
naught, and cast him out; and he hid himself in the cavity of a rock by
day, and by night he went forth viewing the <89 <83 <332 come
upon the people.

13:14 And as he dwelt in the <33 of a rock he made the remainder of
his record, <32 the destructions <32 came upon the people, by
night.

13:15 And it came to pass that in that same year in <23 he was cast
out from <248 the people <134 began to be a <112 war <10 the
<39 for <12 were many who rose up, who were mighty men, and
sought to destroy Coriantumr by <195 secret plans of wickedness, of
<46 hath been spoken.

13:16 And now Coriantumr, having studied, himself, in all the arts of
war and all the cunning of the world, wherefore he gave battle unto
them who <48 to <48 him.

13:17 But he repented not, neither his fair sons nor daughters; <6
the fair sons and daughters of Cohor; <9 the fair sons and
<9 of Corihor; and in fine, <99 were none of the fair sons and
<15 upon the face of the whole <460 who <47 of <102 sins.

13:18 Wherefore, it came to pass that in the first year that Ether
<201 in the <201 of a rock, <46 were many <161 who were slain by
the sword of those <140 combinations, fighting against <147
that they might obtain the kingdom.

13:19 And it came to pass that the sons of <21 fought much and
bled much.

13:20 And in the second year the word of the Lord came to Ether, that
he <286 go and prophesy unto <32 that, if he would repent, and
all his household, the Lord <9 give unto him his kingdom and spare
the people—

13:21 Otherwise they <35 be destroyed, and all his household save it
were himself. And he <14 only live to see the <451 of the
<382 <246 had been spoken concerning another <128 receiving
the land for <163 inheritance; and <70 <27 receive a burial
by them; and every soul <10 be destroyed save it were Coriantumr.

13:22 And it came to pass that <28 <197 not, <229 his
<94 <4 the people; and the wars ceased not; and they <270
to kill <128 but he fled from before them and hid again in the <205
of the rock.

13:23 And it came to pass that <216 arose up Shared, and he also gave
<315 unto Coriantumr; and he did beat him, insomuch that in the third
year he did bring him into captivity.

13:24 And the sons of <365 in the fourth year, did beat <42
and did <243 the <179 <70 unto <133 father.

13:25 Now <61 <434 to be a war upon all the face of the land, <141
man with his band <281 for that <174 he desired.

13:26 And <30 were robbers, and in <359 all manner of wickedness
upon all the face of the land.

13:27 And it came to pass that <167 was exceedingly angry with
<80 and he went <329 him with his armies to battle; and they did
meet in <510 anger, and they did meet in the valley of Gilgal; and the
<147 became <37 sore.

13:28 And it came to pass that Shared <348 <43 him for the space
of three days. And it came to pass that <68 beat him, and did
pursue him until he came to the plains of Heshlon.

13:29 And it came to pass that <43 gave him <60 <165 upon the
plains; and behold, he did beat <189 and drove him back <15 to
the <86 of Gilgal.

13:30 And <57 gave <33 <31 <16 in the <15 of Gilgal,
in <173 he beat <13 and slew him.

13:31 And <9 wounded <26 in his thigh, that he did not go to
<34 <34 for the <109 of two years, in <34 time all the <379
upon the face of the land were shedding blood, and <215 was none to
restrain them.

Ether Chapter 14

14:1 And now <19 <264 to be a <188 curse upon all the land because
of the iniquity of the people, in which, if a man <414 lay his tool
or his sword upon his shelf, or upon the place whither he <499 keep
it, <147 upon the morrow, he could not find it, so <50 was the
<53 upon the <279

14:2 Wherefore <319 man did cleave unto that <109 was his own, with
his hands, and <42 not borrow <452 <4 he lend; and <23 man
kept the hilt of his <68 in his right hand, in the defence of his
property and his own life and of his wives and children.

14:3 And now, after the <169 of two <169 and <7 the death of
<339 <95 <141 <466 the brother of <203 and he gave <194
unto <251 in <81 <211 did beat him and did <294 him to
the wilderness of Akish.

14:4 And it came to pass that the <37 of <37 did give <36
unto him in the <25 of Akish; and the <11 <366 <366
sore, and many thousands fell by the sword.

14:5 And it came to pass that <63 did lay siege to the
wilderness; and the <48 of <48 did march forth out of the
<47 by night, and slew a part of the army of <97 as they
were drunken.

14:6 And he came <29 to the land of Moron, and placed himself upon
the throne of Coriantumr.

14:7 And it came to pass that <69 dwelt with his army in the
<57 for the <170 of two <170 in <149 he did receive <253
strength to his army.

14:8 Now the <91 of <183 whose name was Gilead, also received
<22 <21 to his army, <324 of secret combinations.

14:9 And it came to pass that his high priest murdered him as he sat
upon his throne.

14:10 And it came to pass that one of the <37 combinations <24
him in a <7 pass, and obtained unto <115 the kingdom; and his
name was Lib; and Lib was a man of <71 stature, more than any other
man among all the people.

14:11 And it came to pass that in the first year of Lib, <141
came up unto the land of <169 and gave <243 unto Lib.

14:12 And it came to pass that he fought with Lib, in <154 Lib did
smite upon his arm that he was wounded; nevertheless, the army of
<46 did press forward upon Lib, that he fled to the borders upon
the seashore.

14:13 And it came to pass that <26 pursued him; and Lib gave
<68 unto him upon the <23

14:14 And it came to pass that Lib did <64 the army of <280
that they fled again to the <242 of <371

14:15 And it came to pass that Lib did <391 him until he came to the
plains of Agosh. And <64 had taken all the people with him as he
fled before Lib in that quarter of the land whither he fled.

14:16 And when he had come to the <38 of Agosh he gave <96 unto
Lib, and he smote upon him <58 he died; <146 the <298 of
Lib did come against <60 in the stead thereof, and the <28
<436 <436 <435 in the <181 <15 fled <107 <66 the
army of the <31 of Lib.

14:17 Now the name of the <12 of Lib was called Shiz. And it came
to pass that Shiz <173 after <147 and he did overthrow many
cities, and he did slay both women and children, and he did burn the
cities.

14:18 And there went a fear of Shiz throughout all the land; yea, a cry
went <457 <10 the land—Who can stand <83 the army of Shiz?
Behold, he sweepeth the earth <11 him!

14:19 And it came to pass that the <180 began to flock together in
armies, <37 all the face of the land.

14:20 And they were divided; and a part of them fled to the army of
Shiz, and a part of them fled to the army of Coriantumr.

14:21 And so <401 and lasting had been the war, and so long had been
the scene of bloodshed and carnage, that the whole face of the land was
covered with the bodies of the dead.

14:22 And so swift and speedy was the war that <145 was none left to
bury the dead, but they did march <143 from the shedding of blood to
the <6 of blood, leaving the <44 of both men, women, and
children strewed upon the face of the land, to become a prey to the
worms of the flesh.

14:23 And the scent thereof went <49 upon the face of the <27 even
upon all the face of the <213 wherefore the <180 <297 troubled by
day and by night, because of the <33 thereof.

14:24 Nevertheless, Shiz did not cease to <401 Coriantumr; for he had
sworn to avenge himself upon <325 of the <100 of his brother,
who had been slain, and the word of the Lord <344 came to Ether that
<24 should not fall by the sword.

14:25 And thus we see that the Lord did visit them in the fulness of
his wrath, and their wickedness and abominations had prepared a way for
<10 everlasting destruction.

14:26 And it came to pass that Shiz did <89 <55 eastward,
even to the borders by the seashore, and <205 he gave <426 unto Shiz
for the space of three days.

14:27 And so terrible was the destruction among the armies of Shiz that
the <156 <336 to be frightened, and <5 to flee <358 the <17
of <145 and they fled to the land of Corihor, and swept off the
inhabitants <20 them, all them that would not join them.

14:28 And they pitched <103 tents in the valley of Corihor; and
<96 <11 his <11 in the <11 of Shurr. Now the <5 of
Shurr was near the hill Comnor; wherefore, <21 did gather his
<69 <413 upon the hill Comnor, and did sound a trumpet unto the
<14 of Shiz to invite them <274 to battle.

14:29 And it came to pass that they came forth, but were driven again;
and they came the second time, and they were <12 again the <8
time. And it came to pass that they came <13 the third <21 and the
<179 <307 exceedingly sore.

14:30 And it came to pass that Shiz smote upon <93 that he gave
him many deep wounds; and Coriantumr, having lost his <394 fainted,
and was carried away as though he were <443

14:31 Now the loss of men, women and <407 on both sides was so
<496 that Shiz commanded his <217 that they <316 not <265 the
<131 of <213 <154 they returned to <187 camp.

<337 Chapter 15

15:1 And it came to pass when <82 had recovered of his wounds,
he <252 to remember the words <366 <27 had spoken unto him.

15:2 He saw that <307 had been slain by the sword already nearly two
millions of his people, and he <35 to sorrow in his heart; yea, <24
had been <25 two <19 of mighty men, and also <80 wives and
<4 children.

15:3 He <30 to repent of the evil <66 he had done; he <11 to
<77 the <77 <11 had been <77 by the mouth of all the
prophets, and he saw them that they were fulfilled thus far, every
whit; and his soul mourned and refused to be comforted.

15:4 And it came to pass that he wrote an epistle unto Shiz, desiring
him that he <361 spare the <108 and he <6 give up the kingdom
for the sake of the lives of the people.

15:5 And it came to pass that when Shiz had received his <44 he
<49 an <5 unto <260 that if he <41 give himself up,
that he might slay him with his own sword, that he <16 <63 the
<50 of the <50

15:6 And it came to pass that the <260 repented not of <165
iniquity; and the <9 of <238 were stirred up to anger against
the <11 of Shiz; and the <5 of Shiz were <16 up to <16
<17 the <11 of <288 <288 the <5 of Shiz did
give <373 unto the <9 of Coriantumr.

15:7 And when <48 saw that he was about to fall he fled <402
before the <23 of Shiz.

15:8 And it came to pass that he came to the waters of Ripliancum,
which, by interpretation, is large, or to exceed all; <64 when
they came to these <20 they pitched <109 tents; and Shiz also
<7 his tents near unto them; and therefore on the morrow they did
come to <510

15:9 And it came to pass that they fought an <473 sore battle,
in <291 <96 was wounded again, and he fainted with the loss of
blood.

15:10 And it came to pass that the <431 of <26 did press upon
the <8 of Shiz that they beat them, that they caused them to flee
<130 <78 and they did flee southward, and did pitch <98 <91 in
a place <63 was called Ogath.

15:11 And it came to pass that the army of <53 did <26 <26
<27 by the hill Ramah; and it was that same hill where my father
Mormon did hide up the records unto the Lord, <46 were sacred.

15:12 And it came to pass that they did gather together all the <209
upon all the face of the land, who had not been slain, save it was
Ether.

15:13 And it came to pass that Ether did behold all the doings of the
people; and he beheld that the <44 who were for <96 were
gathered <55 to the army of <301 and the <16 who were
for Shiz were <16 <16 to the army of <280

15:14 Wherefore, they were for the space of four years gathering
<21 the <452 that they <404 get all who were upon the face of
the <97 and that they <15 receive all the strength <133 it was
possible that they could receive.

15:15 And it came to pass that when they were all <70 together,
every one to the army <31 he would, with <194 wives and <3
children—both men women and children being armed with weapons of war,
having shields, and breastplates, and head-plates, and <14 clothed
after the manner of war—they did march forth one <433 another to
battle; and they <327 all that day, and conquered not.

15:16 And it came to pass that when it was night they were weary, and
retired to <68 camps; and <47 they had <8 to <8 camps they
took up a howling and a lamentation for the loss of the slain of <18
<210 and so great were <7 cries, <2 howlings and lamentations,
that they did rend the air exceedingly.

15:17 And it came to pass that on the <432 they did go <496 to
<417 and <37 and terrible was that day; nevertheless, they
<100 not, and when the <90 came <21 they did rend the air with
<57 <59 and <3 howlings, and <3 mournings, for the loss of
the <82 of <10 people.

15:18 And it came to pass that <292 wrote <38 an epistle unto
Shiz, desiring that he would not come <12 to <70 but that he
<10 take the kingdom, and spare the lives of the <42

15:19 And behold, the Spirit of the Lord had ceased striving with <476
and Satan had full power over the hearts of the <151 for they were
given up unto the hardness of <82 hearts, and the blindness of <6
minds that they <312 be destroyed; wherefore they went <73 to
battle.

15:20 And it came to pass that they <250 all that day, and when the
<148 came they slept upon <39 swords.

15:21 And on the <185 they <24 even until the <20 came.

15:22 And when the <9 came they were drunken with anger, even as a
man who is <10 with wine; and they <45 <72 upon <46 <46

15:23 And on the <46 they <46 again; and when the <38 came they
had all fallen by the sword save it were fifty and two of the <475 of
Coriantumr, and sixty and nine of the <10 of <474

15:24 And it came to pass that they <61 upon <60 swords that night,
and on the <59 they <59 again, and they contended in <16 <157
with <4 <20 and with <4 <419 all that day.

15:25 And when the <80 came there were thirty and two of the <61
of <262 and twenty and seven of the <10 of Coriantumr.

15:26 And it came to pass that they ate and slept, and prepared for
death on the morrow. And they were large and mighty men as to the
strength of men.

15:27 And it came to pass that they <95 for the space of three
hours, and they fainted with the loss of blood.

15:28 And it came to pass that when the men of <356 had received
sufficient <49 that they could walk, they were about to flee for
<128 lives; but <339 Shiz arose, and also his men, and he swore in
his wrath that he <371 slay <38 or he <5 perish by the
sword.

15:29 Wherefore, he did pursue <364 and on the <186 he did overtake
them; and they <97 <265 with the <25 And it came to pass that
when they had all <256 by the sword, save it were <52 and
<180 behold Shiz had <117 with the loss of <117

15:30 And it came to pass that when <24 had leaned upon his
<34 that he rested a little, he smote off the head of <281

15:31 And it came to pass that after he had smitten off the head of
<59 that Shiz raised upon his hands and fell; and <19 that he had
struggled for breath, he died.

15:32 And it came to pass that <68 fell to the earth, and became
as if he had no life.

15:33 And the Lord spake unto Ether, and said unto him: Go forth. And
he went forth, and beheld that the words of the Lord had all been
fulfilled; and he finished his record; (and the hundredth part I have
not written) and he hid them in a manner that the <333 of Limhi did
find them.

15:34 Now the last <46 which are written by Ether are these: Whether
the Lord will that I be translated, or that I suffer the will of the
Lord in the flesh, it mattereth not, if it so be that I am saved in the
kingdom of God. Amen.




 THE BOOK OF MORONI

Moroni Chapter 1

1:1 Now I, Moroni, <180 having made an end of abridging the account of
the <101 of Jared, I had supposed not to have <93 more, but I
have not as yet perished; and I make not myself known to the Lamanites
lest they should destroy me.

1:2 For <373 <377 wars are exceedingly fierce among themselves; and
because of <11 hatred they put to <469 every Nephite that will not
deny the Christ.

1:3 And I, <85 will not deny the Christ; wherefore, I wander
whithersoever I can for the safety of mine own <250

1:4 <399 I write a few more things, contrary to that <192 I had
supposed; for I had <109 not to have <109 any more; but I <25
a few more <26 that perhaps they may be of worth unto my brethren,
the Lamanites, in some future day, according to the will of the Lord.

<178 <178 2

2:1 The <251 of Christ, <61 he <320 unto his disciples, the twelve
whom he had chosen, as he laid his <380 upon them—

2:2 And he called them by name, saying: Ye shall call on the Father in
my <11 in mighty prayer; and <224 ye have done this ye <19 have
power that to him upon whom ye <10 lay your hands, ye <5 give the
Holy Ghost; and in my name <10 ye give it, for thus do mine apostles.

2:3 Now Christ <89 these <96 unto them at the time of his first
appearing; and the multitude heard it not, but the disciples <6 it;
and on as many as they laid <239 <60 fell the Holy Ghost.

<143 <143 3

3:1 The <411 <141 the <138 who were <120 the elders of the
church, ordained priests and teachers—

3:2 After they had prayed unto the <131 in the name of <173 they
laid <53 <160 upon them, and said:

3:3 In the name of Jesus <101 I ordain you to be a priest, (or, if he
be a teacher) I <14 you to be a teacher, to preach repentance and
remission of sins through <32 <51 by the endurance of faith on
his name to the end. <443

3:4 And <197 this <104 did they <40 <94 and teachers,
<273 to the gifts and callings of God unto men; and they <111
them by the <215 of the Holy Ghost, <133 was in them.

<149 <149 4

4:1 The <45 of <115 <144 and <46 administering the flesh and
blood of <111 unto the church; and they administered it <58 to
the commandments of <406 wherefore we know the <32 to be true;
and the elder or priest did minister it—

4:2 And they did kneel down with the <193 and pray to the <183 in
the name of <133 <327

4:3 O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son,
<155 <22 to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all
those who partake of it; that they may eat in remembrance of the body
of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the <51 <51 that they
are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember
him, and keep his <126 <167 he hath given <266 that they may
<17 have his Spirit to be with <180 <222

<181 <181 5

5:1 The <149 of <177 the wine—Behold, they took the cup, and
<300

5:2 O God, the <73 <73 we ask <81 in the name of thy Son,
<124 <124 to <124 and <124 this wine to the <124 of all <123
who drink of it, that they may do it in <125 of the <229 of thy
Son, <93 was shed for them; that they may <132 unto <51 O God,
the <60 <60 that they do <104 <121 him, that they may
have his <110 to be with <110 <110

<110 <110 6

6:1 And now I speak concerning baptism. Behold, elders, priests, and
teachers were baptized; and they were not baptized save they brought
forth fruit meet that they were worthy of it.

6:2 Neither did they receive any unto baptism save they came <23 with
a broken heart and a contrite spirit, and witnessed unto the church
that they truly repented of all <356 sins.

6:3 And none were received unto <37 save they took upon them the
name of <166 having a determination to serve him to the end.

6:4 And <441 they had been <31 unto baptism, and were wrought
upon and cleansed by the <430 of the Holy <430 they were numbered
among the people of the <74 of <399 and <70 names were taken,
that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to
keep them in the right way, to keep them continually watchful unto
prayer, relying alone upon the merits of <89 who was the author and
the finisher of <50 faith.

6:5 And the <62 did meet together oft, to fast and to pray, and to
<206 one with another <209 the welfare of <29 souls.

6:6 And they did meet <28 oft to <416 of <427 and wine, in
<290 of the Lord Jesus.

6:7 And they were strict to observe that there should be no iniquity
<130 <301 and whoso was found to commit iniquity, and three witnesses
of the <78 did condemn them before the <273 and if they <219
not, and confessed not, <73 <152 were blotted out, and they were not
<173 <42 the <172 of Christ.

6:8 But as oft as they <31 and sought forgiveness, with real
intent, they were forgiven.

6:9 And <41 meetings were conducted by the <63 <234 the <449 of
the workings of the Spirit, and by the <231 of the Holy Ghost; for as
the <9 of the Holy Ghost led them whether to preach, or to exhort,
or to <171 or to supplicate, or to sing, even so it was done.

<398 <398 7

7:1 And now I, Moroni, write a few of the words of my father Mormon,
<458 he spake <203 faith, hope, and charity; for <84 this
<85 did he <219 unto the people, as he taught them in the synagogue
<27 they had built for the place of worship.

7:2 And now I, <45 <29 unto you, my beloved brethren; and it is
by the grace of God the <502 and our Lord Jesus <300 and his holy
will, because of the gift of his calling unto me, that I am permitted
to <42 unto you at this time.

7:3 Wherefore, I would <13 unto you that are of the church, that are
the peaceable followers of <49 and that have obtained a sufficient
hope by <97 ye can enter into the rest of the Lord, from this time
henceforth until ye shall rest with him in heaven.

7:4 And now my brethren, I judge these things of you <90 of your
<54 walk with the children of men.

7:5 For I remember the word of God, <59 saith by <268 works ye <48
know <345 for if <9 <9 be good, then they are good also.

7:6 For behold, God hath said a man being evil cannot do that <37 is
good; for if he offereth a gift, or prayeth unto God, except he <47
do it with real intent it profiteth him nothing.

7:7 For <43 it is not counted unto him for righteousness.

7:8 For <14 if a man <55 evil giveth a <45 he doeth it
grudgingly; wherefore it is <27 unto him the same as if he had
retained the gift; <16 he is <16 evil <436 God.

7:9 And likewise also is it <13 evil unto a man, if he <83 pray
and not with real <84 of heart; yea, and it <88 him nothing,
for God receiveth none such.

7:10 <249 a man <78 evil <133 do that <133 is <132 neither
will he give a good gift.

7:11 For <103 a bitter fountain <23 bring forth good water;
<23 can a good <11 <10 <10 <15 <10 wherefore, a man
<44 a servant of the devil <25 follow Christ; and if he <5
Christ he <10 be a <17 of the devil.

7:12 <74 all <263 <69 are good cometh of God; and that <8
is evil <9 of the devil; for the <43 is an enemy unto God, and
fighteth against him continually, and inviteth and enticeth to sin, and
to do that <33 is evil continually.

7:13 But <103 that <11 is of God <25 and <25 to do good
continually; <98 every thing <15 <12 and <12 to do
<298 and to love God, and to serve him, is inspired of God.

7:14 <94 take heed, my <469 <364 that ye do not <367
that <37 is evil to be of God, or that <9 is good and of God to be
of the <132

7:15 For <80 my <36 it is given unto you to judge, that ye
may know good from evil; and the way to <51 is as plain, that ye may
know with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night.

7:16 For <48 the Spirit of <198 is <49 to <121 man, that he
may know good from <48 <132 I show unto you the way to judge;
for <21 <142 <96 <142 to do <139 and to persuade to believe
in Christ, is sent <261 by the power and gift of <253 <358 ye
may know with a <76 knowledge it is of God.

7:17 But whatsoever <43 persuadeth men to do evil, and <40 not in
<41 and deny him, and <186 not God, then ye may know with a
<38 <38 it is of the <268 for after this manner doth the
<273 work, for he <43 no man to do <87 no, not one; <347
do his angels; <5 do they who subject themselves unto him.

7:18 And now, my <192 seeing that ye know the light by <123 ye
may <197 <5 <8 is the <3 of <81 see that ye do not <197
wrongfully; for with that same judgment <20 ye <10 ye <464 also be
judged.

7:19 <279 I beseech of you, <51 that ye should search
diligently in the <43 of <204 that ye may know good from <198 and
if ye will lay hold upon <195 good thing, and condemn it not, ye
certainly will be a child of Christ.

7:20 And now, my <50 how is it possible that ye can lay hold upon
<35 good thing?

7:21 And now I come to that faith, of <95 I said I would speak; and I
will tell you the way whereby ye may lay hold on <35 good thing.

7:22 For <302 God knowing all things, being from everlasting to
everlasting, <11 he sent angels to minister unto the children of
men, to make manifest concerning the coming of <279 and in <127
there <138 come <46 good <46

7:23 And God also declared unto prophets, by his own mouth, that <23
<22 come.

7:24 And <54 <31 were divers ways that he did <48 things
unto the <59 of men, <109 were good; and all <12 <6 are
good cometh of <63 otherwise men were fallen, and <33 could no
good <333 come unto them.

7:25 <222 by the ministering of angels, and by <82 word <35
proceeded <381 out of the mouth of God, men began to exercise faith in
<46 and thus by <173 they did lay hold upon <29 good thing; and
thus it was until the <131 of <224

7:26 And <362 that he came men also were saved by <40 in his name;
and by <40 they become the sons of God. And as sure as <138 liveth
he spake these words unto our fathers, saying: Whatsoever <102 ye
<328 ask the Father in my name, <94 is <398 in <44 believing that
ye <16 receive, <162 it <4 be done unto you.

7:27 <126 my beloved <296 have miracles ceased because
<53 hath ascended into heaven, and hath sat down on the right hand
of God, to claim of the <55 his rights of mercy <56 he hath upon
the <200 of men?

7:28 For he hath answered the ends of the law, and he claimeth all
those who have <82 in him; and they who have <7 in him will cleave
unto <167 good <167 wherefore he advocateth the cause of the
<49 of men; and he dwelleth eternally in the heavens.

7:29 And <97 he hath done this, my <108 <108 have <108
ceased? Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither have <348 <119 to
<350 unto the <42 of men.

7:30 For <150 they are subject unto him, to <18 according to
the word of his command, showing themselves unto them of strong <90
and a firm mind in <90 form of godliness.

7:31 And the office of their ministry is to call men unto repentance,
and to fulfill and to do the work of the covenants of the Father, <169
he hath made unto the <79 of men, to prepare the way among the
<10 of men, by declaring the word of <219 unto the chosen
vessels of the Lord, that they may bear testimony of him.

7:32 And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the residue
of men may have <105 in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may have place in
<98 hearts, <133 to the power thereof; and <357 this manner
bringeth to pass the <92 the <97 <94 he hath made unto the
<84 of men.

7:33 And <84 hath said: If ye will have <53 in me ye <332 have
<43 to do whatsoever <362 is expedient in me.

7:34 And he hath <28 Repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto
me, and be baptized in my <383 and have <44 in me, that ye may be
saved.

7:35 And now, my <269 <269 if this be the case that <426
things are true <95 I have spoken unto you, and God will show unto
you, with <80 and great glory at the last day, that they are true,
and if they are true has the day of <315 <314

7:36 Or have <312 <312 to appear unto the <138 of men? Or has
he withheld the <45 of the Holy <183 from them? Or will he, so long
as time <143 last, or the earth <5 stand, or there <4 be one man
upon the face thereof to be saved?

7:37 <375 I say unto you, Nay; for it is by <138 that <75 are
wrought; and it is by <10 that <77 <75 and <370 unto men;
wherefore, if <135 <134 have <88 wo be unto the <88 of men,
for it is <433 of unbelief, and all is vain.

7:38 For no man can be saved, <274 to the words of <291 save
they <88 have <54 in his name; <49 if <49 <49 have
ceased, then has <13 <54 also; and awful is the state of man, for
they are as though <120 had been no redemption made.

7:39 But <466 my <228 <228 I judge better <40 of you, for
I <8 that ye have <44 in <312 <88 of your meekness; for if
ye have not <13 in him then ye are not fit to be numbered <429 the
people of his church.

7:40 And again, my <53 <53 I would speak unto you concerning
hope. How is it that ye can attain unto faith, save ye <118 have hope?

7:41 And what is it that ye <13 hope for? <206 I say unto you that
ye <11 have hope through the atonement of <88 and the <264 of his
resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this <103 of your
<97 in him <181 to the promise.

7:42 Wherefore, if a man have <16 he must needs have hope; for
without <9 <164 cannot be any <93

7:43 And <110 behold I say unto you that he <17 have <21 and
hope, save he <79 be meek, and lowly of heart.

7:44 If so, his <20 and hope is vain, for none is acceptable before
God, save the meek and <26 in heart; and if a man be meek and <10
in heart, and confesses by the <117 of the Holy <381 that Jesus is
the <283 he must <94 have charity; for if he have not charity he
is nothing; wherefore he must <16 have charity.

7:45 And <16 suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is
not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no
evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but <5 in the truth, beareth
all things, believeth all <3 hopeth all <3 endureth all
things.

7:46 <181 my <266 <266 if ye have not charity, ye are
nothing, for <69 never faileth. <17 cleave unto <12
which is the greatest of all, for all <342 must fail—

7:47 But <24 is the pure love of <126 and it <55 forever;
and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it <202 be well
with him.

7:48 <55 my <72 <72 pray unto the Father with all the
energy of <183 that ye may be filled with this love, <73 he hath
bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, <195 Christ; that
ye may become the sons of God; that when he <61 appear we <3 be
like him, for we <7 see him as he is; that we may have this <315
that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.

Moroni Chapter 8

8:1 An epistle of my father Mormon, written to me, Moroni; and it was
<8 unto me soon after my calling to the ministry. And on this wise
did he write unto me, saying:

8:2 My <133 son, Moroni, I rejoice exceedingly that your Lord <107
<430 hath been mindful of you, and hath called you to his ministry,
and to his holy work.

8:3 I am <22 of you always in my prayers, continually praying unto
God the <177 in the name of his Holy Child, Jesus, that he, <483
his infinite goodness and grace, will keep you <10 the endurance of
<408 on his name to the end.

8:4 And now, my son, I speak unto you concerning that <208 grieveth me
exceedingly; for it <6 me that <479 should disputations rise
among you.

8:5 For, if I have learned the <349 <18 have been <19
<18 you <37 the baptism of your little children.

8:6 And now, my son, I desire that ye <43 labor diligently, that
this gross error <8 be removed from <33 you; for, for this intent
I have <197 this epistle.

8:7 For immediately <202 I had <62 these <362 of you I inquired
of the Lord <63 the matter. And the word of the Lord came to me
by the <508 of the Holy Ghost, <220

8:8 Listen to the words of <387 your Redeemer, your Lord and your
God. Behold, I came into the world not to call the righteous but
sinners to repentance; the whole need no physician, but they that are
sick; wherefore, <125 children are whole, for they are not capable of
committing sin; wherefore the curse of Adam is taken from them in me,
that it hath no <81 over them; and the law of circumcision is done
away in me.

8:9 And <129 this manner did the Holy Ghost manifest the word of God
unto me; <64 my <326 son, I know that it is solemn mockery
before God, that ye <182 baptize <81 <206

8:10 Behold I say unto you that this thing <430 ye teach—repentance
and <228 unto those who are accountable and <99 of <98
sin; yea, teach parents that they must repent and be baptized, and
humble themselves as their <47 children, and they <37 all be saved
with <11 <11 <58

8:11 And <8 <8 <147 need no repentance, neither baptism.
<183 <56 is unto repentance to the fulfilling the commandments
unto the remission of sins.

8:12 But <29 <29 are alive in <218 even from the foundation
of the world; if not so, God is a partial God, and also a changeable
God, and a respecter to persons; for how many <36 <36 have died
without baptism!

8:13 Wherefore, if <13 <13 could not be <95 <14 baptism,
<311 must have gone to an endless hell.

8:14 <159 I say unto you, that he that supposeth that <31 <31
need <104 is in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity,
for he hath <125 faith, hope, nor charity; <219 <204 he be
cut off while in the thought, he must go down to <57

8:15 For awful is the wickedness to suppose that God saveth one child
because of <86 and the other must perish <8 he hath no
<176

8:16 Wo be unto them that <207 pervert the ways of the Lord <298 this
manner, for they <13 <30 except they repent. <202 I speak with
boldness, having authority from God; and I fear not what man can do;
for perfect love casteth out all fear.

8:17 And I am filled with charity, which is everlasting love;
<116 all <143 are alike unto me; <7 I love <152
<10 with a <36 <18 and they are all <17 and partakers of
salvation.

8:18 For I know that God is not a <241 God, <162 a <240
being; but he is unchangeable from all eternity to all eternity.

8:19 Little <49 cannot repent; <57 it is <161 <159
to deny the pure mercies of God unto them, for they are all <302 in
him <161 of his mercy.

8:20 And he that saith that <90 <40 need <241 denieth the
<33 of <326 and setteth at naught the atonement of him and the
<490 of his redemption.

8:21 Wo unto such, for they are in danger of death, hell, and an
<301 torment. I <185 it boldly; God hath commanded me. Listen unto
them and give heed, or they stand against you at the judgment-seat of
Christ.

8:22 For behold that all <79 <79 are <99 in <75 and also
all they that are <359 the law. For the <76 of redemption cometh
on all them that have no law; <145 he that is not condemned, or
he that is under no condemnation, <161 <161 and unto such <125
availeth nothing—

8:23 But it is mockery before God, denying the <137 of <62 and
the <53 of his Holy Spirit, and putting trust in dead works.

8:24 <306 my son, this thing ought not to be; for repentance is unto
them that are <62 condemnation and <3 the curse of a broken law.

8:25 And the first fruits of <26 is baptism; and <77 <106
by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the <5 the
commandments bringeth remission of sins;

8:26 And the <9 of sins <13 meekness, and lowliness of
heart; and <255 of meekness and <9 of heart <43 the
visitation of the Holy Ghost, <362 Comforter filleth with hope and
<349 love, <9 love endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the
end <423 come, when all the saints <6 dwell with God.

8:27 <126 my son, I will write unto you again if I go not out soon
<244 the Lamanites. <19 the pride of this nation, or the people
of the Nephites, hath proven their destruction <471 they should
<473

8:28 Pray for <360 my son, that <141 may come unto them. But
behold, I fear lest the Spirit hath ceased striving with them; and in
this part of the land they are also seeking to put down all <226 and
authority <114 <132 from God; and they are <245 the Holy Ghost.

8:29 And after rejecting so great a knowledge, my son, they must perish
soon, unto the <194 of the prophecies <35 were spoken by the
prophets, as well as the words of our Savior himself.

8:30 Farewell, my son, <165 I <157 <145 unto you, or <5 meet you
again. Amen.

Moroni Chapter 9

9:1 My beloved son, I <24 unto you <169 that ye may know that I am
yet alive; but I <16 somewhat of that <70 is grievous.

9:2 For <144 I have had a sore battle with the Lamanites, in <19
we did not conquer; and Archeantus has fallen by the sword, and also
Luram and Emron; yea, and we have lost a <130 number of our choice
men.

9:3 And now <49 my son, I fear lest the Lamanites <105 destroy
this people; for they do not repent, and Satan stirreth them up
continually to anger one with another.

9:4 <266 I am laboring with them continually; and when I speak the
word of God with sharpness they tremble and <29 <291 me; and when
I use no <13 they harden <284 hearts <13 it; <504 I
fear lest the <265 of the Lord hath <268 <268 with <281

9:5 For so exceedingly do they <40 that it seemeth me that they have
no fear of death; and they have lost <45 <390 one towards another;
and they thirst <267 blood and revenge continually.

9:6 And now, my <213 son, notwithstanding <24 hardness, let us
labor diligently; for if we <359 cease to labor, we <5 be brought
<512 condemnation; for we have a <20 to perform whilst in this
tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness,
and rest our souls in the kingdom of God.

9:7 And now I <258 <258 concerning the sufferings of this people.
For according to the knowledge <249 I have received from Amoron,
<218 the <213 have many prisoners, <13 they took from the
tower of Sherrizah; and there were men, women, and children.

9:8 And the husbands and fathers of those women and children they have
slain; and they feed the <11 upon the flesh of <131 husbands, and
the <19 upon the <10 of <10 fathers; and no water, save a
little, do they give unto <205

9:9 And <161 this <311 abomination of the <342 it
doth not exceed that of our people in Moriantum. For <97 many of
the daughters of the <103 have they taken prisoners; and <208
depriving them of that <111 was most dear and precious above all
things, <10 is chastity and virtue—

9:10 And <26 they had done this thing, they did murder them in a most
cruel manner, torturing <95 bodies even unto <269 and <23 they
have done this, they devour <14 <112 like unto wild beasts, because
of the hardness of <12 hearts; and they do it for a token of bravery.

9:11 O my <282 son, how can a <109 like <39 that are without
civilization—

9:12 (And only a few years have passed away, and they were a civil and
a delightsome people)

9:13 But O my son, how can a <41 like <41 whose delight is in so
much abomination—

9:14 How can we expect that God will stay his hand in judgment <419
us?

9:15 <461 my heart cries: Wo unto this <298 Come out in judgment,
O God, and hide <114 sins, and wickedness, and abominations from
before thy face!

9:16 And again, my son, <297 are many widows and <24 <217 who
remain in <310 and that part of the provisions <204 the
<229 did not carry <117 <242 the army of Zenephi has carried
<9 and left them to wander whithersoever they can for food; and many
old <318 do faint by the way and die.

9:17 And the army <46 is with me is weak; and the armies of the
<55 are betwixt Sherrizah and me; and as many as have fled to the
army of Aaron have fallen victims to <93 awful brutality.

9:18 O the depravity of my people! They are <219 order and <3
mercy. <155 I am but a man, and I have but the strength of a man,
and I cannot any longer enforce my commands.

9:19 And they have become strong in <55 perversion; and they are
alike brutal, sparing none, neither old nor young; and they <235 in
everything save that <111 is good; and the suffering of our <134 and
our <446 upon all the face of this land doth <420 everything;
yea, tongue <64 tell, <40 can it be written.

9:20 And now, my son, I dwell no <80 upon this horrible scene.
<106 thou knowest the wickedness of this people; thou <7 that
they are <123 principle, and past feeling; and <92 <17 doth
<53 that of the Lamanites.

9:21 <33 my son, I <61 recommend them unto God lest he should
smite me.

9:22 But <252 my son, I <19 thee unto God, and I trust in
Christ that thou wilt be saved; and I pray unto God that he will spare
thy life, to witness the return of his <385 unto him, or <74 utter
destruction; for I know that they must perish except they repent and
<23 unto him.

9:23 And if they <16 it will be like unto the Jaredites, <492 of
the wilfulness of <40 hearts, seeking for blood and revenge.

9:24 And if it so be that they perish, we know that many of our
brethren have deserted over unto the Lamanites, and many more will also
desert over unto them; wherefore, write somewhat a few things, if thou
art spared and I shall <71 and not see thee; but I <135 that I may
see thee soon; for I have sacred records that I would deliver up unto
thee.

9:25 My son, be faithful in Christ; and may not the things <284 I have
written grieve thee, to weigh thee down unto death; but may <183 lift
thee up, and may his sufferings and death, and the showing his body
unto our fathers, and his mercy and long-suffering, and the hope of his
glory and of eternal <201 rest in your mind forever.

9:26 And may the grace of God the Father, whose throne is high in the
heavens, and our Lord Jesus Christ, who sitteth on the right hand of
his power, until all <94 <138 <404 subject unto him, be, and
abide with you <50 Amen.

Moroni Chapter 10

10:1 Now I, Moroni, <176 <176 as seemeth me <407 and I <8 unto
my brethren, the Lamanites; and I <158 that they <330 know that more
than four hundred and twenty years have passed away since the sign was
given of the coming of Christ.

10:2 And I seal up these records, after I have spoken a few words by
way of exhortation unto you.

10:3 <394 I <58 exhort you that when ye <107 read <30 <256
if it be wisdom in God that ye <74 read them, that ye <24 remember
how merciful the Lord hath been unto the <502 of men, from the
creation of Adam even down unto the time that ye <45 receive <45
<46 and ponder it in your hearts.

10:4 And when ye <18 <18 <18 <17 I <50 <74 you that ye
<6 ask God, the Eternal <213 in the name of <205 if <21
<196 are not true; and if ye <32 ask with a sincere heart, with
real intent, having faith in <24 he will manifest the truth of it
unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.

10:5 And by the <12 of the Holy Ghost ye may know the <29 of all
things.

10:6 And whatsoever thing is good is just and <68 <418 nothing
that is good denieth the <60 but acknowledgeth that he is.

10:7 And ye may know that he is, by the <54 of the Holy Ghost;
wherefore I <121 <127 you that ye deny not the <16 of God; for he
worketh by <322 according to the <109 of the <189 of men, the
same today and tomorrow, and <324

10:8 And again, I <40 you, my <308 that ye deny not the gifts
of God, for they are many; and they come from the same God. And there
are different ways that <181 <23 are administered; but it is the
same God who <70 all in all; and they are <328 by the
manifestations of the Spirit of God unto men, to profit them.

10:9 For behold, to one is <24 by the <20 of God, that he may
teach the word of wisdom;

10:10 And to another, that he may <15 the word of knowledge by the
same Spirit;

10:11 And to <20 exceedingly great faith; and to <6 the
<92 of healing by the same <22

10:12 And <138 to <17 that he may work mighty miracles;

10:13 And <14 to <14 that he may prophesy concerning all
things;

10:14 And <16 to <16 the beholding of angels and ministering
spirits;

10:15 And <16 to <16 all kinds of tongues;

10:16 And <12 to <12 the interpretation of languages and of
divers <19 of tongues.

10:17 And all <183 <91 come by the <142 of Christ; and they come
unto every man severally, <254 as he will.

10:18 And I <281 <241 you, my beloved <242 that ye <465
that <24 good gift cometh of Christ.

10:19 And I <23 <23 you, my <23 <23 that ye <23
that he is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and that all <71
<72 of which I have spoken, <4 are spiritual, never will be done
away, even as long as the world <449 stand, only <81 to the
unbelief of the <336 of men.

10:20 Wherefore, <301 must be <211 and if <6 must be <356 <4
must also be hope; and if <8 must be hope <4 must also be
charity.

10:21 And except ye have charity ye can in nowise be saved in the
kingdom of God; neither can ye be <11 in the <10 of God if ye
have not <61 <16 can ye if ye have no hope.

10:22 And if ye have no hope ye must needs be in despair; and despair
<164 because of iniquity.

10:23 And Christ truly said unto our fathers: If ye have <101 ye can
do all things <150 are expedient unto me.

10:24 And now I speak unto all the ends of the earth—that if the day
<49 that the <503 and <185 of God <167 be done away among you, it
<8 be <66 of unbelief.

10:25 And wo be unto the <179 of men if this be the case; for <158
<25 be none that doeth good <35 you, no not one. For if <15 be
one <11 you that <16 good, he <23 work by the <65 and <65 of
God.

10:26 And wo unto them who <19 do <267 <111 away and die, for they
die in their sins, and they cannot be <189 in the <189 of God; and
I <122 it <268 to the words of <363 and I lie not.

10:27 And I <331 you to <327 <47 <440 for the time speedily
<139 that ye <59 know that I lie not, for ye <8 see me at the
bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my
<58 unto you, <200 were written by this man, like as one crying from
the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the dust?

10:28 I <34 <73 <120 unto the fulfilling of the prophecies. And
behold, they <67 proceed forth out of the mouth of the everlasting
God; and his word <15 hiss <15 from generation to generation.

10:29 And God <13 show unto you, that that <75 I have <76 is
true.

10:30 And again I <469 <138 you that ye <5 come unto Christ, and
lay hold upon <495 good gift, and touch not the evil <6 nor the
unclean thing.

10:31 And awake, and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on
thy beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion; and strengthen thy stakes
and enlarge thy borders forever, that thou mayest no more be
confounded, that the covenants of the Eternal Father <92 he hath made
unto thee, O house of Israel, may be fulfilled.

10:32 Yea, come unto <91 and be perfected in him, and deny
yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye <135 deny <9 of all
ungodliness and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then
is his grace sufficient for you, that by his <7 ye may be perfect in
<298 and if by the <12 of God ye are <13 in <63 ye can in
nowise deny the <367 of God.

10:33 And again, if ye by the <28 of God are <27 in <27 and
deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in <506 by the <21 of
God, through the shedding of the blood of <26 <138 is in the
covenant of the <147 unto the remission of your <399 that ye become
holy, without spot.

10:34 And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the
paradise of God, until my spirit and body <150 <268 reunite, and I am
brought <304 triumphant <67 the air, to meet you before the
pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the <215 Judge of both quick and
dead. Amen.
