THE BOOK OF <14

An <95 <95
 BY THE HAND OF <13

UPON PLATES TAKEN FROM THE <4 OF NEPHI


Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi,
and also of the Lamanites—Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant
of the house of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile—Written by way of
commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of
revelation—Written and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they
might not be destroyed—To come forth by the gift and power of God unto
the interpretation thereof—Sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up
unto the <33 to come <27 in due time by way of the Gentile—The
<26 thereof by the gift of God.

An <115 taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a <123 of
the <124 of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded
the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to
heaven—Which is to show unto the <143 of the House of Israel what
great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may
know the covenants of the <100 that they are not cast off forever—And
also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST,
the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations—And now, if there
are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the
<67 of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of
Christ.

Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and <138 unto whom
this work shall come: That we, through the grace of God the Father, and
our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates <189 contain this record,
<5 is a <194 of the <193 of <317 and also of the <313
<153 brethren, and also of the <15 of <208 who came from the
<193 of <31 hath been spoken. And we also know that they have been
translated by the gift and <294 of God, for his voice hath declared it
unto us; wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true. And we
also testify that we have seen the engravings <52 are upon the
plates; and they have been shown unto us by the <49 of God, and not
of man. And we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God
came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we
beheld and saw the plates, and the <59 thereon; and we know that
it is by the <172 of God the <172 and our Lord <171 <171 that
we <31 and bear <165 that these <248 are <102 And it is
marvelous in our eyes. Nevertheless, the <130 of the Lord commanded us
that we should bear <27 of it; <280 to be obedient unto the
commandments of God, we bear testimony of <42 things. And we know
that if we are faithful in <63 we <252 rid our garments of the
blood of all men, and be <309 <309 <113 the <309 of
<22 and <22 dwell with him eternally in the heavens. And the
honor be to the <107 and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, <190 is

THE <101 BOOK OF <32 HIS <101 AND <101 (1 Nephi)


An account of Lehi and his wife Sariah and his four sons, being called,
(beginning at the eldest) Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. The Lord warns
Lehi to depart out of the land of Jerusalem, because he prophesieth
unto the people concerning their iniquity and they seek to destroy his
life. He taketh three days’ journey into the wilderness with his
family. Nephi <12 his brethren and returneth to the land of
Jerusalem after the <306 of the Jews. The <85 of <43
sufferings. They take the daughters of Ishmael to wife. They take <13
families and <75 into the wilderness. Their sufferings and
afflictions in the <8 The course of <19 travels. They come
to the large waters. Nephi’s <60 rebel against him. He confoundeth
them, and buildeth a ship. They call the name of the place Bountiful.
They cross the <27 waters into the promised land, and so forth. This
is according to the <83 of Nephi; or in other words, I, Nephi,
wrote this record.

1 <119 Chapter 1

1:1 I, <17 having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was
taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and <20 seen many
<106 in the <104 of my days, nevertheless, <12 been highly
favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, <13 had a great knowledge
of the goodness and the mysteries of God, <53 I make a <177 of
my proceedings in my days.

1:2 Yea, I make a <16 in the language of my father, <451 consists
of the <76 of the Jews and the <15 of the Egyptians.

1:3 And I know that the <31 <25 I make is true; and I make it with
mine own hand; and I make it <158 to my knowledge.

1:4 For it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of the
reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my <74 Lehi, <116 dwelt at
<282 in all his days); and in that same year there came many
prophets, prophesying unto the <335 that they must repent, or the
<143 city <28 must be destroyed.

1:5 Wherefore it came to pass that my <49 <49 as he went forth
prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his
people.

1:6 And it came to pass as he <27 unto the <27 <71 came a pillar
of fire and <92 upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard much;
and <426 of the things <161 he saw and <12 he did quake and
tremble exceedingly.

1:7 And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem;
and he cast himself upon his bed, <493 overcome with the Spirit and
the <47 <47 he had seen.

1:8 And <18 thus <19 with the Spirit, he was carried away in a
vision, even that he saw the heavens open, and he thought he saw God
sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of
angels in the attitude of singing and praising <449 God.

1:9 And it came to pass that he saw One descending out of the midst of
heaven, and he beheld that his luster was above that of the sun at
noon-day.

1:10 And he also saw twelve others following him, and <51 brightness
did exceed that of the stars in the firmament.

1:11 And they came down and went <234 upon the face of the earth; and
the <310 came and stood <203 my <255 and gave unto him a book,
and bade him that he should read.

1:12 And it came to pass that as he read, he was filled with the <182
of the Lord.

1:13 And he <17 saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for I have seen thine
abominations! Yea, and many <205 did my father read concerning
Jerusalem—that it <56 be destroyed, and the inhabitants thereof;
many <9 perish by the sword, and many <7 be <214 away
captive into Babylon.

1:14 And it came to pass that when my <42 had read and seen many
<384 and marvelous things, he did exclaim many <60 unto the Lord;
such as: Great and <15 are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! Thy
throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and goodness, and mercy
are over all the <83 of the earth, and, <357 thou art
merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come unto thee that they shall
perish!

1:15 And after this manner was the language of my <89 in the
<288 of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole heart was
filled, <52 of the <97 <362 he had seen, yea, <5 the Lord
had shown unto him.

1:16 And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the <30 <25
my <57 hath written, for he hath written many <12 <12 he saw in
visions and in dreams; and he also hath <16 many <16 <16 he
prophesied and spake unto his children, of <10 I <110 not make a
full account.

1:17 But I <13 make an <60 of my proceedings in my days. Behold,
I make an abridgment of the record of my <322 upon plates <39 I
have made with mine own hands; wherefore, <149 I have abridged the
<22 of my <93 then will I make an <46 of mine own life.

1:18 Therefore, I would that ye <279 know, that <32 the Lord had
<144 so many <246 <101 unto my <57 Lehi, yea, <317
the destruction of <338 behold he went <407 among the people,
and began to prophesy and to declare unto them <23 the <31
<84 he had both seen and heard.

1:19 And it came to pass that the Jews did mock him <217 of the
<28 <27 he testified of them; for he truly <6 of <484
wickedness and <4 abominations; and he <10 that the <22
<23 he saw and heard, and also the <10 <9 he read in the <467
manifested plainly of the coming of the Messiah, and also the
redemption of the world.

1:20 And when the Jews heard these <34 they were angry with him;
yea, even as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast out, and
stoned, and slain; and they also sought his life, that they might take
it away. But behold, I, <304 will show unto you that the tender
mercies of the Lord are over all <387 whom he hath chosen, <132 of
<116 faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.

1 Nephi Chapter 2

2:1 For <50 it came to pass that the Lord <317 unto my <222
yea, even in a dream, and said unto him: Blessed art thou <235 <53
of the <119 <153 thou hast done; and <10 thou hast been faithful
and declared unto this people the <18 <18 I commanded thee,
<54 they seek to take away thy <297

2:2 And it came to pass that the Lord <23 my <65 even in a
<64 that he <310 take his family and depart into the wilderness.

2:3 And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord,
wherefore he did as the Lord <45 him.

2:4 And it came to pass that he departed into the <43 And he
left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his
silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it
were his family, and provisions, and tents, and <43 into the
<44

2:5 And he came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea; and
he traveled in the wilderness in the <17 <159 are nearer the Red
Sea; and he did travel in the <17 with his <55 <17
consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, who were Laman,
Lemuel, and Sam.

2:6 And it came to pass that when he had <55 three days in the
wilderness, he pitched his tent in a valley by the side of a river of
water.

2:7 And it came to pass that he built an altar of stones, and made an
offering unto the <191 and gave thanks unto the Lord our God.

2:8 And it came to pass that he called the name of the river, <90
and it emptied into the Red Sea; and the <70 was in the <136 near
the mouth thereof.

2:9 And when my father saw that the waters of the <88 <32 into
the fountain of the Red Sea, he <366 unto <48 saying: O that thou
mightest be like unto this <60 continually running into the <24
of all righteousness!

2:10 And he also <30 unto Lemuel: O that thou <28 be like unto
this valley, firm and steadfast, and immovable in keeping the
commandments of the Lord!

2:11 Now this he <33 <402 of the stiffneckedness of Laman and
Lemuel; for behold they did murmur in many <406 against <480 <381
<21 he was a visionary man, and had led them out of the land of
Jerusalem, to leave the land of <25 <335 and <3 <335 and
<4 <335 and <3 <335 <335 to perish in the <319
And this they said he had done <48 of the foolish imaginations of
his heart.

2:12 And thus <79 and <284 being the eldest, did <78 <75
<41 father. And they did <8 <31 they knew not the dealings of
that God who had created them. 2:13 Neither did they believe that
<84 that great city, could be destroyed according to the words
of the prophets. And they were like unto the Jews who were at
<26 who sought to take away the life of my <62

2:14 And it came to pass that my <251 did speak unto them in the
<276 of <93 with power, <95 filled with the Spirit, until <94
frames did shake before him. And he did confound them, that they durst
not utter <114 him; wherefore, they did as he commanded <101

2:15 And my <52 dwelt in a tent.

2:16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, <56 exceedingly young,
nevertheless <5 large in stature, and also having <127 desires to
know of the mysteries of God, <52 I did cry unto the Lord; and
<259 he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did <164 all
the <155 <500 had been spoken by my father; <34 I did not
rebel <94 him like unto my brothers.

2:17 And I <313 unto Sam, making known unto him the <304 <34 the
Lord had manifested unto me by his Holy Spirit. And it came to pass
that he believed in my words.

2:18 But, behold, <267 and Lemuel would not hearken unto my words; and
<119 grieved <264 of the hardness of <181 hearts I cried unto the
Lord for <164

2:19 And it came to pass that the Lord <79 unto me, <455 Blessed
art thou, <162 <36 of thy faith, for thou hast <258 me
diligently, with lowliness of <337

2:20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye <5 prosper,
and <4 be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land <123 I have
prepared for you; yea, a land <10 is choice above all other lands.

2:21 And <46 as thy brethren <38 <172 <172 thee, they <5
be cut off from the presence of the Lord.

2:22 And <25 as thou shalt keep my <71 thou <5 be
made a ruler and a teacher over thy brethren.

2:23 For <166 in that day that they <47 <52 <52 me, I will
curse them even with a sore curse, and they <16 have no power over
thy seed except they <10 <26 <26 me also.

2:24 And if it so be that they <15 <15 me, they <20 be a
scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in the ways of remembrance.

1 Nephi Chapter 3

3:1 And it came to pass that I, <204 returned from speaking with the
Lord, to the tent of my <459

3:2 And it came to pass that he <237 unto me, <237 Behold I have
dreamed a dream, in the <187 the Lord hath <432 me that thou and
thy <183 <85 return to Jerusalem.

3:3 For <146 Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a genealogy
of my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of brass.

3:4 Wherefore, the Lord hath <49 me that thou and thy brothers
should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring them
down hither into the wilderness.

3:5 And now, <459 thy <30 murmur, saying it is a hard thing
<98 I have required of them; but <18 I have not <8 it of
them, but it is a commandment of the <277

3:6 Therefore go, my son, and thou <274 be favored of the <168
<380 thou hast not murmured.

3:7 And it came to pass that I, <193 said unto my father: I will go
and do the <488 <70 the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the
Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he <178
prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the <106 <35 he
commandeth <470

3:8 And it came to pass that when my father had heard these words he
was exceedingly glad, for he knew that I had been blessed of the <119

3:9 And I, <92 and my <239 took our journey in the wilderness,
with our tents, to go up to the land of <253

3:10 And it came to pass that when we had gone up to the land of
Jerusalem, I and my <43 did consult one with another.

3:11 And we cast lots—who of us <248 go in unto the <249 of Laban.
And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and Laman went in
unto the <22 of <271 and he talked with him as he sat in his house.

3:12 And he desired of <336 the records <158 were <323 upon the
<325 of brass, <9 contained the <341 of my <401

3:13 And <361 it came to pass that <30 was angry, and thrust him
out from his presence; and he would not that he <96 have the
records. <361 he said unto him: <424 thou art a robber, and I
will slay thee.

3:14 But <101 fled out of his presence, and told the <273 <71
<55 had done, unto us. And we began to be <225 sorrowful, and
my <165 were about to <449 unto my <245 in the <388

3:15 But <369 I said unto them that: As the Lord liveth, and as we
live, we will not go down unto our <31 in the wilderness until we
have accomplished the <304 <66 the Lord hath <458 us.

3:16 <107 let us be faithful in keeping the <343 of the
Lord; therefore let us go down to the land of our father’s inheritance,
for <70 he left gold and silver, and all manner of riches. And all
this he hath done <423 of the <40 of the <328

3:17 For he knew that Jerusalem must be destroyed, <19 of the
wickedness of the people.

3:18 For <212 they have rejected the <375 of the prophets.
<87 if my <111 <203 dwell in the land after he hath been
<107 to flee out of the land, <31 he <226 also perish.
<27 it must needs be that he flee out of the land.

3:19 And <23 it is wisdom in God that we <48 obtain <435
records, that we may preserve unto our <482 the language of our
fathers;

3:20 And also that we may <19 unto them the <88 <181 have been
spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets, <13 have been delivered
unto them by the Spirit and power of God, since the world began, even
down unto this present time.

3:21 And it came to pass that <123 this <186 of <71 did I
persuade my brethren, that they might be <230 in <230 the
<191 of God.

3:22 And it came to pass that we went down to the land of our
<237 and we did gather together our gold, and our <239 and
our precious things.

3:23 And <63 we had gathered <145 <364 together, we went up again
unto the <477 of <499

3:24 And it came to pass that we went in unto <492 and <476 him
that he <210 give unto us the <482 <142 were <482 upon the
<482 of <482 for <10 we <18 give unto him our <75 and our
<76 and all our <76 <76

3:25 And it came to pass that when <438 saw our property, and that it
was <437 great, he did lust <96 it, insomuch that he <508 us
out, and sent his servants to slay us, that he <164 <257 our
property.

3:26 And it came to pass that we did flee before the <26 of <105
and we were obliged to leave behind our <61 and it fell into the
hands of <139

3:27 And it came to pass that we fled into the wilderness, and the
<40 of <94 did not overtake us, and we hid ourselves in the
cavity of a rock.

3:28 And it came to pass that Laman was angry with me, and also with my
father; and also was Lemuel, for he hearkened unto the <334 of Laman.
Wherefore <25 and Lemuel did speak many hard <12 unto us, their
younger brothers, and they did smite us even with a rod.

3:29 And it came to pass as they smote us with a rod, <417 an angel
of the Lord came and stood <144 them, and he spake unto <5 saying:
Why do ye <44 your <51 brother with a rod? Know ye not that the
Lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you, and this because of your
iniquities? Behold ye shall go up to Jerusalem again, and the Lord will
deliver <156 into your hands.

3:30 And <245 the <75 had <452 unto us, he departed.

3:31 And <14 the <14 had departed, <133 and <133 <353 began to
murmur, <85 How is it possible that the Lord will <46 <46
into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty,
yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?

1 Nephi Chapter 4

4:1 And it came to pass that I <143 unto my <479 <59 Let us
go up <70 unto Jerusalem, and let us be <488 in <488 the
<488 of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth,
then why not <9 than <86 and his <74 yea, or even than his
tens of thousands?

4:2 Therefore let us go up; let us be strong like unto Moses; for he
truly <74 unto the waters of the Red Sea and they divided hither and
thither, and our fathers came through, out of captivity, on dry ground,
and the armies of Pharaoh did follow and were drowned in the <36 of
the Red Sea.

4:3 Now <97 ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an
<204 hath <218 unto you; wherefore can ye doubt? Let us go up; the
Lord is able to <203 us, even as our fathers, and to destroy <453
even as the Egyptians.

4:4 Now when I had <40 these words, they were yet wroth, and did
still continue to murmur; nevertheless they did <90 me up until we
came without the walls of Jerusalem.

4:5 And it was by night; and I caused that they should hide themselves
<23 the walls. And <299 they had hid themselves, I, Nephi, crept
into the city and went forth towards the house of Laban.

4:6 And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things
which I <47 do.

4:7 Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near unto the <39 of
<249 I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth <449 me, for he
was drunken with wine.

4:8 And when I came to him I found that it was <76

4:9 And I <41 his sword, and I drew it <95 from the sheath
thereof; and the hilt thereof was of pure gold, and the workmanship
<9 was exceedingly fine, and I saw that the blade <10 was of
the most precious steel.

4:10 And it came to pass that I was constrained by the Spirit that I
<125 kill Laban; but I said in my heart: Never at any time have I
shed the blood of man. And I shrunk and would that I might not slay
him.

4:11 And the <43 said unto me again: Behold the Lord hath delivered
him into thy hands. Yea, and I also knew that he had sought to take
away mine own life; yea, and he <48 not hearken unto the <451
of the <452 and he also had taken away our property.

4:12 And it came to pass that the <63 said unto me <63 Slay him,
for the Lord hath <66 him into thy hands;

4:13 <79 the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring <186 his righteous
purposes. It is better that one man <142 perish than that a nation
<7 dwindle and <9 in unbelief.

4:14 And now, when I, <321 had heard <380 <380 I remembered the
words of the Lord <303 he <499 unto me in the wilderness, saying
that: Inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my commandments, they <5
prosper in the land of promise.

4:15 Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the <141
of the Lord according to the law of Moses, save they <83 have the
law.

4:16 And I also knew that the law was engraven upon the plates of
brass.

4:17 And again, I knew that the Lord had <154 <374 into my hands
for this cause—that I <250 obtain the records <58 to his
commandments.

4:18 Therefore I did obey the voice of the <433 and took <33 by
the hair of the head, and I smote off his head with his own sword.

4:19 And <489 I had smitten off his head with his own <395 I took
the garments of <40 and put them upon mine own body; yea, even every
whit; and I did gird on his armor about my loins.

4:20 And <45 I had done this, I went <246 unto the treasury of
<452 And as I went <11 towards the <11 of Laban, behold, I saw
the servant of <59 who had the keys of the treasury. And I commanded
him in the <120 of <25 that he <189 go with me into the <19

4:21 And he supposed me to be his master, <22 for he <505 the
<106 and also the sword girded <90 my <90

4:22 And he <283 unto me concerning the elders of the Jews, he knowing
that his <36 <36 had been out by night among them.

4:23 And I <29 unto him as if it had been <115

4:24 And I also <16 unto him that I <90 carry the engravings,
<340 were upon the <268 of brass, to my elder brethren, who were
without the walls.

4:25 And I also bade him that he <33 follow me.

4:26 And he, supposing that I <50 of the brethren of the church, and
that I was truly that <169 whom I had slain, wherefore he did <33
me.

4:27 And he <31 unto me many times <128 the <128 of the <128
as I went <214 unto my <79 who were <78 the <78

4:28 And it came to pass that when Laman saw me he was exceedingly
frightened, and also Lemuel and Sam. And they fled from before my
presence; for they <211 it was <172 and that he had slain me and
had sought to take away their lives also.

4:29 And it came to pass that I called <307 them, and they did hear
me; <110 they did cease to flee from my presence.

4:30 And it came to pass that when the <307 of <138 <266 my
<153 he began to tremble, and was <267 to flee from <84 me and
return to the city of Jerusalem.

4:31 And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also having
received much strength of the Lord, therefore I did seize upon the
<58 of <118 and held him, that he <228 not flee.

4:32 And it came to pass that I <199 with him, that if he would
hearken unto my words, as the Lord liveth, and as I live, even so that
if he <20 <19 unto our <19 we <6 spare his life.

4:33 And I <42 unto him, even with an oath, that he need not fear;
that he <71 be a free man like unto us if he <35 go down in the
wilderness with us.

4:34 And I also <41 unto him, saying: Surely the Lord hath <466
us to do this thing; and shall we not be diligent in keeping the
commandments of the Lord? Therefore, if thou wilt go down into the
<48 to my father thou shalt have place with us.

4:35 And it came to pass that Zoram did take courage at the words <418
I spake. Now <12 was the name of the servant; and he promised that he
<99 go down into the <50 unto our father. Yea, and he also
made an oath unto us that he <21 tarry with us from that time forth.

4:36 Now we were desirous that he <148 <18 with us for this cause,
that the Jews might not know <413 our flight into the wilderness,
lest they <23 pursue us and destroy us.

4:37 And it came to pass that when <92 had made an oath unto us, our
fears did <354 <38 him.

4:38 And it came to pass that we took the plates of brass and the
<300 of <300 and departed into the <61 and journeyed unto
the tent of our <120

1 Nephi Chapter 5

5:1 And it came to pass that <421 we had come down into the <148
unto our father, behold, he was filled with joy, and also my mother,
Sariah, was <496 glad, for she truly had mourned because of us.

5:2 For she had <495 that we had perished in the wilderness; and
she also had complained against my <47 telling him that he was a
visionary man; <294 Behold thou hast led us forth from the land of
our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we perish in the
wilderness.

5:3 And <100 this manner of language had my mother <53 <53
my <130

5:4 And it had come to pass that my <313 <355 unto her, <61 I
know that I am a <71 man; for if I had not seen the things of God
in a vision I <238 not have known the goodness of God, but had
tarried at Jerusalem, and had <124 with my brethren.

5:5 But <167 I have obtained a land of promise, in the <353 <44
I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of
the hands of <244 and bring them down again unto us in the
<129

5:6 And <129 this <129 of <129 did my <178 Lehi, comfort my
<220 <219 <298 us, while we <272 in the <243 up
to the land of <90 to obtain the record of the Jews.

5:7 And when we had returned to the tent of my <43 behold their joy
was full, and my <181 was comforted.

5:8 And she spake, <169 Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath
commanded my husband to flee into the <268 yea, and I also know
of a <22 that the Lord hath protected my sons, and delivered them
out of the <131 of <131 and given them power whereby they could
accomplish the thing <166 the Lord hath <49 them. And <133 this
<134 of <134 did she speak.

5:9 And it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and did
offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord; and they gave thanks
unto the God of Israel.

5:10 And <49 they had <69 <16 unto the God of Israel, my <143
<187 took the records <73 were engraven upon the <473 of brass,
and he did search them from the beginning.

5:11 And he beheld that they did contain the five books of Moses, <33
gave an account of the creation of the world, and also of Adam and Eve,
who were our first parents;

5:12 And also a <230 of the Jews from the beginning, even down to the
commencement of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah;

5:13 And also the prophecies of the holy prophets, from the <29
even down to the <29 of the <29 of Zedekiah; and also many
<23 <82 have been spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah.

5:14 And it came to pass that my <141 <140 also found upon the
<137 of brass a genealogy of his fathers; wherefore he knew that he
was a descendant of Joseph; yea, even that Joseph who was the son of
Jacob, who was sold into Egypt, and who was preserved by the hand of
the Lord, that he might preserve his <58 <23 and all his
household from perishing with famine.

5:15 And they were also led out of captivity and out of the land of
<47 by that same God who had <50 <299

5:16 And thus my <46 <104 did discover the <98 of his
fathers. And Laban also was a <96 of Joseph, <107 he and
his fathers had kept the records.

5:17 And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled with
the Spirit, and began to prophesy <476 his seed—

5:18 That <21 <158 of <158 should go forth unto all nations,
kindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed.

5:19 Wherefore, he said that <28 <28 of <28 <28 never perish;
neither <5 they be dimmed any more by time. And he prophesied many
things <59 his <34

5:20 And it came to pass that thus far I and my <93 had kept the
commandments wherewith the Lord had <447 us.

5:21 And we had obtained the <390 <275 the Lord had <16 us,
and searched them and <263 that they were desirable; yea, even of
great worth unto us, insomuch that we <495 <227 the <47
of the Lord unto our children.

5:22 <109 it was wisdom in the Lord that we <105 carry them
with us, as we journeyed in the wilderness towards the land of promise.

1 Nephi Chapter 6

6:1 And now I, Nephi, do not give the <233 of my <218 in this
part of my record; <153 at any time shall I give it after upon <171
<172 <111 I am writing; for it is given in the <448 <11 has been
kept by my father; wherefore, I do not write it in this work.

6:2 For it sufficeth me to say that we are descendants of Joseph.

6:3 And it mattereth not to me that I am particular to give a full
account of all the <219 of my <332 for they cannot be written upon
<81 plates, for I desire the room that I may <65 of the <24 of
God.

6:4 For the fulness of mine intent is that I may persuade men to come
unto the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of <435
and be saved.

6:5 <206 the <48 <129 are pleasing unto the world I do not
write, but the <14 <14 are <14 unto God and unto those who
are not of the world.

6:6 <36 I <184 give commandment unto my seed, that they <8
not occupy <109 <189 with <37 <37 are not of <285 unto the
children of men.

1 <245 <245 7

7:1 And now I would that ye might know, that <227 my <154 <486 had
made an end of prophesying <384 his <55 it came to pass that
the Lord spake unto him again, saying that it was not meet for him,
<32 that he <320 take his family into the <315 alone; but
that his sons <13 take daughters to wife, that they <61 raise up
seed unto the Lord in the land of <336

7:2 And it came to pass that the Lord <412 him that I, <338 and
my brethren, <41 again return unto the land of Jerusalem, and bring
down Ishmael and his <66 into the wilderness.

7:3 And it came to pass that I, <35 did <99 with my <36 go
forth into the <89 to go up to Jerusalem.

7:4 And it came to pass that we went up unto the house of Ishmael, and
we did gain favor in the sight of <11 <477 that we did speak
unto him the words of the Lord.

7:5 And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the heart of <31
and also his household, <36 that they took their journey with us
down into the <83 to the tent of our father.

7:6 And it came to pass that as we <509 in the wilderness, behold
Laman and Lemuel, and two of the <195 of <52 and the two sons
of <153 and <51 families, did rebel against us; yea, <3 me,
<147 and Sam, and <14 <272 <25 and his <223 and his three
other daughters.

7:7 And it came to pass in the <327 rebellion, they were desirous to
<209 unto the land of <170

7:8 And now I, <47 being grieved for the hardness of <50 hearts,
therefore I <306 unto them, saying, yea, even unto <94 and unto
Lemuel: Behold ye are mine elder <218 and how is it that ye are so
hard in your <34 and so blind in your minds, that ye have need that
I, your younger brother, <283 <204 unto you, yea, and set an example
for you?

7:9 How is it that ye have not hearkened unto the word of the Lord?

7:10 How is it that ye have forgotten that ye have seen an angel of the
<21

7:11 Yea, and how is it that ye have <23 what great <473 the
Lord hath done for us, in delivering us out of the hands of Laban, and
also that we <88 obtain the record?

7:12 Yea, and how is it that ye have <41 that the Lord is able to
do all <48 according to his will, for the children of men, if it so
be that they exercise faith in him? Wherefore, let us be faithful to
him.

7:13 And if it so be that we are <16 to him, we shall <71 the
land of promise; and ye <9 know at some future period that the word
of the Lord <13 be fulfilled concerning the destruction of Jerusalem;
for all <78 <272 the Lord hath spoken <14 the <14 of
Jerusalem must be fulfilled.

7:14 For behold, the Spirit of the Lord ceaseth soon to strive with
them; for <14 they have rejected the prophets, and Jeremiah have
they cast into prison. And they have sought to take away the life of my
<353 <424 that they have driven him out of the land.

7:15 Now <42 I say unto you that if ye will <349 unto <76
ye <101 also perish with them. And now, if ye have choice, go up to
the land, and remember the <500 <110 I <304 unto you, that if ye go
ye will also perish; for thus the <106 of the Lord constraineth me
that I <241 speak.

7:16 And it came to pass that when I, <402 had <148 these <45
unto my <381 they were angry with me. And it came to pass that
they did lay <419 <288 upon me, for <104 they were exceedingly
wroth, and they did bind me with cords, for they <144 to take away my
life, that they might leave me in the wilderness to be devoured by wild
beasts.

7:17 But it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord, saying: O <3
<313 to my <299 <129 is in thee, wilt thou deliver me from the
<75 of my brethren; yea, even give me strength that I may burst <110
bands with <28 I am bound.

7:18 And it came to pass that when I had said <22 words, <108 the
<25 were loosed from off my <46 and feet, and I stood before my
<147 and I spake unto them again.

7:19 And it came to pass that they were <163 with me again, and <135
to lay <37 upon me; but <50 one of the daughters of Ishmael, yea,
and also her mother, and one of the sons of <13 did plead with my
<57 <303 that they did soften <194 hearts; and they did
cease striving to take away my life.

7:20 And it came to pass that they were sorrowful, because of <28
wickedness, <36 that they did bow down <103 me, and did <51
with me that I would forgive them of the thing that they had done
against me.

7:21 And it came to pass that I did frankly <25 them all that they
had done, and I did exhort them that they <41 pray unto the Lord
<66 God for forgiveness. And it came to pass that they did so. And
after they had done praying unto the Lord we did again travel on our
journey towards the tent of our father.

7:22 And it came to pass that we did come down unto the tent of our
<21 And <44 I and my brethren and all the house of Ishmael had
come down unto the tent of my <482 they did give thanks unto the
Lord <88 God; and they did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto
him.

1 Nephi Chapter 8

8:1 And it came to pass that we had gathered together all manner of
seeds of every kind, both of grain of <6 <6 and also of the <14
of fruit of <11 kind.

8:2 And it came to pass that while my father tarried in the <417
he <320 unto us, <400 Behold, I have dreamed a dream; or, in other
<356 I have seen a vision.

8:3 And <316 <260 of the <237 <391 I have seen, I have reason
to rejoice in the Lord <17 of <106 and also of Sam; for I have
<18 to suppose that they, and also many of <141 seed, will be
saved.

8:4 But <49 Laman and Lemuel, I fear exceedingly <38 of you;
for <12 methought I saw in my dream, a dark and dreary wilderness.

8:5 And it came to pass that I saw a man, and he was dressed in a white
robe; and he came and <452 <349 me.

8:6 And it came to pass that he <139 unto me, and bade me follow him.

8:7 And it came to pass that as I followed him I beheld myself that I
was in a dark and <76 waste.

8:8 And <286 I had traveled for the space of many hours in darkness, I
began to pray unto the Lord that he <373 have mercy on me, according
to the multitude of his tender mercies.

8:9 And it came to pass <45 I had prayed unto the Lord I <70 a
large and spacious field.

8:10 And it came to pass that I <18 a tree, whose <277 was
desirable to make one happy.

8:11 And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the <26
thereof; and I <35 that it was most sweet, above all that I ever
<171 tasted. Yea, and I <17 that the <25 thereof was white, to
exceed all the whiteness that I had ever seen.

8:12 And as I partook of the <25 <25 it filled my soul with
<258 great joy; wherefore, I <150 to be desirous that my family
should <75 of it also; for I knew that it was <105 <72 all
<354 fruit.

8:13 And as I cast my eyes round about, that perhaps I might discover
my <38 also, I <88 a river of water; and it ran along, and it was
near the tree of <377 I was partaking the <45

8:14 And I looked to behold from whence it came; and I saw the head
<101 a little way off; and at the head <9 I <53 your mother
Sariah, and Sam, and Nephi; and they <329 as if they knew not whither
they <112 go.

8:15 And it came to pass that I beckoned unto them; and I also did say
unto them with a loud voice that they <30 come unto me, and <146
of the fruit, <96 was <143 <143 all <142 <97

8:16 And it came to pass that they did come unto me and <28 of the
<200 also.

8:17 And it came to pass that I was <198 that <471 and Lemuel
<57 come and <27 of the <26 <202 <217 I cast mine eyes
towards the head of the river, that <190 I <190 see them.

8:18 And it came to pass that I saw them, but they <390 not come unto
me and <45 of the <92

8:19 And I <165 a rod of iron, and it extended along the bank of the
<53 and led to the tree by <126 I stood.

8:20 And I also <31 a strait and narrow path, <16 came <31 by
the rod of <41 even to the tree by <14 I stood; and it also led by
the head of the fountain, unto a <440 and <440 field, as if it had
been a world.

8:21 And I saw numberless concourses of people, many of whom were
pressing forward, that they <134 obtain the path <52 led unto the
tree by <7 I <89

8:22 And it came to pass that they did come forth, and commence in the
path <23 led to the tree.

8:23 And it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness; yea, even
an <428 <428 mist of darkness, insomuch that they who had
commenced in the path did lose their way, that they wandered off and
were lost.

8:24 And it came to pass that I <165 others <103 <103 and
they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they
did press forward through the mist of <64 clinging to the rod of
<188 even until they did come <35 and <251 of the <296 of the
<111

8:25 And after they had partaken of the <16 of the tree they did cast
<93 eyes about as if they were ashamed.

8:26 And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the <392 side
of the river of water, a <142 and <234 building; and it <461 as
it were in the air, high <418 the earth.

8:27 And it was filled with <239 both old and young, both male and
female; and <71 manner of dress was <186 fine; and they were
in the attitude of mocking and pointing <18 fingers <403 those who
had come at and were partaking of the <378

8:28 And <123 they had tasted of the <123 they were ashamed, because
of <30 that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden
paths and were <222

8:29 And now I, Nephi, do not speak all the words of my father.

8:30 But, to be short in writing, behold, he saw <145 multitudes
<242 forward; and they came and <240 hold of the end of the rod
of <241 and they did <240 <104 way <264 continually holding fast
to the rod of <239 <238 they came <237 and fell down and partook of
the <102 of the <240

8:31 And he also saw <60 <60 feeling <39 way <143 that
<204 and <204 building.

8:32 And it came to pass that many were drowned in the depths of the
fountain; and many were lost from his view, wandering in strange roads.

8:33 And <40 was the multitude that did enter into that <16
<48 And <181 they did <10 into that building they did point
the finger of scorn at me and <186 that were <211 of the <97
also; but we heeded them not.

8:34 These are the <177 of my father: For as many as <18 them, had
fallen away.

8:35 And Laman and Lemuel <138 not of the fruit, said my <203

8:36 And it came to pass <78 my father had spoken all the <46 of
his dream or vision, which were many, he said unto us, <270 of these
things <12 he saw in a <18 he <325 feared for <56 and
Lemuel; yea, he <8 lest they should be cast off from the presence
of the Lord.

8:37 And he did exhort them then with all the <206 of a tender
parent, that they would hearken to his words, that perhaps the Lord
<10 be merciful to <121 and not cast them off; yea, my <97 did
preach unto them.

8:38 And <110 he had preached unto <24 and also prophesied unto them
of many things, he bade them to keep the commandments of the Lord; and
he did cease speaking unto <38

1 Nephi Chapter 9

9:1 And all <133 <132 did my <61 see, and hear, and speak, as he
dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel, and also a <272 many more
<61 <160 cannot be written upon <35 plates.

9:2 And now, as I have <198 concerning <13 plates, behold they are
not the plates upon <28 I make a full account of the history of my
people; for the <17 upon <17 I make a full <17 of my people I
have given the name of Nephi; wherefore, they are called the <24 of
<478 <147 mine own name; and <58 <10 also are <15 the <5
of Nephi.

9:3 Nevertheless, I have received a commandment of the Lord that I
<243 make <28 <86 for the special purpose that there <10 be
an <66 engraven of the ministry of my people.

9:4 Upon the <455 <49 <20 be <17 an <20 of the reign of
the kings, and the wars and contentions of my <111 wherefore <49
<24 are for the more part of the ministry; and the <36 <12 are
for the more part of the <37 of the kings and the wars and
<37 of my <65

9:5 Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me to make <48 <35 for a
wise <98 in him, <165 <4 I know not.

9:6 But the Lord knoweth all <253 from the beginning; <166 he
prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men;
for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words. And
thus it is. Amen.

1 <307 <307 10

10:1 And now I, <208 proceed to give an <147 upon <84 <84 of
my proceedings, and my <117 and <132 <68 to <19 with
mine account, I must speak somewhat of the <85 of my father, and
also of my brethren.

10:2 For <78 it came to pass <258 my <357 had made an end of
<384 the words of his dream, and also of exhorting them to all
diligence, he spake unto them <340 the Jews—

10:3 That <36 they <235 be destroyed, even that <377 city
Jerusalem, and many be carried away captive into Babylon, according to
the own due time of the Lord, they <28 return again, yea, even be
brought back out of captivity; and <43 they <15 be <10 back
out of captivity they <9 possess again the land of their
inheritance.

10:4 Yea, even six hundred years from the time that my <111 left
<70 a prophet would the Lord God raise up <215 the Jews—even a
Messiah, or, in <296 words, a Savior of the world.

10:5 And he also <122 <120 the prophets, how <109 a number had
testified of <203 <490 <13 this <33 of whom he had
spoken, or this Redeemer of the <36

10:6 <316 all mankind were in a lost and in a fallen state, and
ever <76 be save they <109 rely on this Redeemer.

10:7 And he <63 also <51 a <96 who <17 come before the
<58 to prepare the way of the Lord—

10:8 Yea, even he <20 go forth and cry in the wilderness: Prepare ye
the way of the <187 and make his paths straight; for <476 standeth
one <137 you whom ye know not; and he is mightier than I, whose shoe’s
latchet I am not worthy to unloose. And much <76 my <175 <77
this thing.

10:9 And my <11 said he <66 baptize in Bethabara, beyond Jordan;
and he also said he <12 <12 with water; even that he <7
<8 the Messiah with water.

10:10 And <254 he had baptized the <13 with water, he <21
behold and bear record that he had <15 the Lamb of God, who <15
take away the sins of the <190

10:11 And it came to pass <42 my <78 had spoken <221 <370 he
<98 unto my brethren <99 the gospel <510 <35 be preached
<134 the Jews, and also <13 the dwindling of the Jews in
unbelief. And <36 they had slain the <195 who <26 come, and
<11 he had been <12 he <10 rise from the dead, and <6 make
himself manifest, by the Holy Ghost, unto the Gentiles.

10:12 Yea, even my <76 <70 much <55 the Gentiles, and also
<6 the house of Israel, that they <35 be compared like unto
an olive-tree, <203 branches <10 be broken off and <5 be
scattered upon all the face of the earth.

10:13 <319 he said it must needs be that we <24 be led with
one accord into the land of promise, unto the fulfilling of the word of
the <278 that we <24 be <47 upon all the face of the <47

10:14 And <125 the <85 of Israel <20 be <20 they <4 be
gathered together again; or, in fine, <18 the Gentiles had received
the fulness of the Gospel, the natural <100 of the <105 or
the remnants of the <39 of <124 <35 be grafted in, or come to
the knowledge of the true <188 <509 Lord and <3 <406

10:15 And <50 this manner of language did my <169 prophesy and
speak unto my brethren, and also many more things <244 I do not write
in this book; for I have written as many of them as were expedient for
me in mine other book.

10:16 And all <288 <509 of <36 I have <505 were done as my
<58 dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel.

10:17 And it came to pass <84 I, Nephi, having heard all the <325 of
my father, <249 the <79 <43 he saw in a vision, and also the
<11 <11 he <273 by the power of the Holy <292 <10 <6 he
<170 by faith on the Son of God—and the Son of God was the <415
who <165 come—I, <57 was desirous also that I might see, and hear,
and know of <104 <104 by the <40 of the Holy <46 <46 is the
gift of God unto all those who diligently seek him, as well in times of
old as in the time that he <52 manifest <373 unto the children of
men.

10:18 For he is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever; and the way is
prepared for all men from the foundation of the world, if it so be that
they repent and come unto him.

10:19 For he that <72 seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of
God <8 be unfolded unto them, by the <105 of the Holy <105 as
well in <118 <93 as in <3 of old, and as well in <7 of old as
in <6 to come; wherefore, the course of the Lord is one eternal
round.

10:20 Therefore remember, O man, for all thy doings thou shalt be
brought into judgment.

10:21 <445 if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of your
probation, then ye are found unclean before the judgment-seat of God;
and no <9 thing can dwell with God; <68 ye must be cast off
forever.

10:22 And the Holy Ghost giveth authority that I <190 <373 <110
<229 and deny them not.

1 Nephi Chapter 11

11:1 For it came to pass <324 I had desired to know the <306 that my
<354 had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them
known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught away in
the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly high mountain, <294 I
never had <116 <45 and upon <9 I <8 had <8 set my foot.

11:2 And the <33 said unto me: Behold, what desirest thou?

11:3 And I said: I desire to behold the <88 <35 my <87 saw.

11:4 And the <31 said unto me: Believest thou that thy <16 saw
the tree of <24 he hath spoken?

11:5 And I <41 Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the <456 of my
father.

11:6 And when I had spoken <176 words, the <50 cried with a loud
voice, saying: Hosanna to the <122 the most high God; for he is God
over all the earth, yea, even above all. And blessed art thou, <454
because thou believest in the Son of the most high God; <247 thou
<294 <113 the <113 <89 thou hast desired.

11:7 And <12 this <270 <370 be given unto thee for a sign, that
<231 thou hast beheld the tree <28 bore the fruit <4 thy <129
tasted, thou <42 also <31 a man descending out of heaven, and him
<38 ye witness; and <32 ye have witnessed him ye <10 bear record
that it is the Son of God.

11:8 And it came to pass that the <135 said unto me: Look! And I
looked and <67 a tree; and it was like unto the tree <70 my <70
had seen; and the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea, exceeding of all
beauty; and the whiteness <13 did exceed the <5 of the
driven snow.

11:9 And it came to pass <89 I had seen the tree, I said unto the
Spirit: I <116 thou hast shown unto me the tree <62 is precious
<194 all.

11:10 And he said unto me: What <308 <308

11:11 And I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereof—for I
spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I <115 that he was in the form
of a man; yet nevertheless, I knew that it was the <144 of the Lord;
and he <35 unto me as a man speaketh with another.

11:12 And it came to pass that he said unto me: <170 And I <169 as
if to look upon him, and I saw him not; for he had gone from <421 my
presence.

11:13 And it came to pass that I <33 and <87 the great city of
Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I <13 the city of Nazareth;
and in the city of Nazareth I <13 a virgin, and she was <486
fair and white.

11:14 And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel
came down and stood <77 me; and he said unto me: <381 what
beholdest <184

11:15 And I said unto him: A <54 most beautiful and fair <213 all
<81 virgins.

11:16 And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?

11:17 And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children;
<199 I do not know the meaning of all things.

11:18 And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the
mother of the Son of God, <309 the manner of the flesh.

11:19 And it came to pass that I <149 that she was carried away in
the Spirit; and <28 she had been <11 away in the <262 for the
space of a time the <149 <265 unto me, saying: <246

11:20 And I <217 and <42 the <74 again, bearing a child in her
arms.

11:21 And the <31 said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the
Son of the Eternal Father! <151 thou the <125 of the tree <389
thy <452 saw?

11:22 And I answered him, <65 Yea, it is the love of God, <21
sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore,
it is the most desirable <213 all <169

11:23 And he <105 unto me, <40 Yea, and the most joyous to the
soul.

11:24 And <141 he had said these words, he said unto me: <129 And I
looked, and I <127 the Son of God going forth among the <63 of
men; and I saw many fall down at his feet and worship him.

11:25 And it came to pass that I <36 that the rod of iron, <106 my
<127 had seen, was the word of God, <11 led to the fountain of
living waters, or to the tree of life; <15 waters are a
representation of the love of God; and I also <46 that the tree of
life was a <18 of the love of God.

11:26 And the <213 said unto me again: Look and behold the
<353 of God!

11:27 And I <251 and <42 the Redeemer of the world, of whom my
<89 had spoken; and I also <16 the prophet who should prepare the
way <433 him. And the Lamb of God went <151 and was baptized of him;
and <182 he was baptized, I <30 the <466 open, and the Holy
Ghost come down out of heaven and abide upon him in the form of a dove.

11:28 And I <30 that he went <47 ministering unto the people, in
power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together to
hear him; and I <27 that they cast him out from <227 them.

11:29 And I also <16 twelve others following him. And it came to
pass that they were <411 away in the <411 from <114 my face, and
I saw them not.

11:30 And it came to pass that the <180 <319 unto me <411 <320
<297 And I <296 and I <53 the <126 open <13 and I saw
angels descending upon the <300 of men; and they did minister unto
<83

11:31 And he <41 unto me <28 <41 <40 And I <40 and I
<41 the Lamb of God <337 <139 <110 the <37 of men. And I
<15 <136 of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with
all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits; and the
<95 <54 and showed all <396 things unto me. And they were healed
by the <183 of the Lamb of God; and the <31 and the <32 spirits
were cast out.

11:32 And it came to pass that the <44 <44 unto me <98 <98
<99 And I <310 and <82 the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the
people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the world;
and I saw and bear record.

11:33 And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain
for the sins of the world.

11:34 And <331 he was <16 I saw the <150 of the earth, that
they were <292 <292 to fight against the apostles of the Lamb;
for thus were the <282 called by the <108 of the Lord.

11:35 And the multitude of the earth was <34 together; and I
<116 that they were in a large and spacious building, like unto the
building <497 my <433 saw. And the <41 of the Lord <152 unto me
<153 <153 Behold the world and the wisdom thereof; yea, <479 the
house of Israel hath <51 <85 to <85 <85 the <76
<87 of the Lamb.

11:36 And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the <412
and <70 <65 was the pride of the <177 and it fell, and the
fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the <78 of the Lord <78
unto me <78 <78 Thus shall be the destruction of all nations,
kindreds, tongues, and <463 that <13 <75 <75 the <75
<75 of the <75

1 Nephi Chapter 12

12:1 And it came to pass that the <52 said unto me: Look, and <118
thy seed, and also the seed of thy brethren. And I <288 and <172
the land of promise; and I <8 <228 of <62 yea, even as it
were in number as many as the sand of the sea.

12:2 And it came to pass that I <31 <31 <167 <167 to
battle, one <94 the other; and I <13 wars, and rumors of <4
and <157 slaughters with the sword <443 my people.

12:3 And it came to pass that I <27 many generations pass away,
<311 the <443 of wars and contentions in the land; and I <18 many
cities, yea, even that I did not <88 <512

12:4 And it came to pass that I saw a mist of darkness on the face of
the land of <128 and I saw lightnings, and I heard thunderings, and
earthquakes, and all <60 of tumultuous noises; and I saw the <334
and the rocks, that they rent; and I saw mountains tumbling into
pieces; and I saw the plains of the <394 that they were broken up;
and I saw many cities that they were sunk; and I saw many that they
were burned with fire; and I saw many that did tumble to the <36
because of the quaking thereof.

12:5 And it came to pass <145 I saw these things, I saw the vapor of
darkness, that it passed from off the face of the earth; and behold, I
saw <217 who had not fallen <46 of the <205 and terrible
judgments of the <461

12:6 And I saw the heavens open, and the Lamb of God descending out of
heaven; and he came down and showed himself unto <193

12:7 And I also saw and bear record that the Holy Ghost fell upon
<365 others; and they were ordained of God, and chosen.

12:8 And the <357 <406 unto me, <404 <482 the <23 disciples
of the Lamb, who are chosen to minister unto thy seed.

12:9 And he said unto me: Thou rememberest the <26 <413 of the
Lamb? <34 they are they who <429 judge the <14 tribes of Israel;
wherefore, the <7 ministers of thy seed <15 be judged of them;
for ye are of the house of Israel.

12:10 And <181 <25 <25 whom thou beholdest <25 <40 thy
<68 And, <173 they are righteous forever; for <170 of their
faith in the Lamb of God <8 garments are made white in his blood.

12:11 And the <120 said unto me: Look! And I looked, and <368 three
<387 pass away in righteousness; and <32 <32 were <31
even like unto the Lamb of God. And the <32 said unto me: These are
made <19 in the blood of the <154 <71 of <31 <70 in him.

12:12 And I, Nephi, also saw many of the fourth generation who <280
away in righteousness.

12:13 And it came to pass that I saw the <285 of the <390
<506 together.

12:14 And the <67 said unto me: <184 thy seed, and also the seed of
thy brethren.

12:15 And it came to pass that I looked and <118 the people of my
seed <43 together in <51 against the seed of my brethren;
and they were <14 <14 to battle.

12:16 And the <59 <278 unto me, <278 <60 the fountain of
filthy water which thy father saw; yea, even the river of <9 he
spake; and the depths thereof are the <4 of hell.

12:17 And the mists of darkness are the temptations of the devil, <28
blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and
leadeth them away into broad roads, that they perish and are lost.

12:18 And the large and spacious building, <38 thy <75 saw, is
vain imaginations and the pride of the <40 of men. And a <454 and
a <456 gulf divideth <327 yea, even the word of the justice of the
Eternal God, and the Messiah who is the Lamb of God, of whom the Holy
<437 beareth record, from the beginning of the world until this time,
and from this time henceforth and forever.

12:19 And while the <166 <166 <368 words, I <202 and saw that the
seed of my brethren did contend <203 my <238 according to the word
of the angel; and <306 of the <101 of my <16 and the <159
of the <160 I <39 that the seed of my <36 did overpower the
<250 of my <414

12:20 And it came to pass that I beheld, and saw the <19 of the seed
of my <31 that they had overcome my seed; and they went forth in
<281 upon the face of the land.

12:21 And I saw them <285 <285 in multitudes; and I saw wars
and rumors of wars among <177 and in wars and <9 of wars I saw
many <447 pass away.

12:22 And the <144 said unto me: <309 <147 <510 dwindle in
unbelief.

12:23 And it came to pass that I <96 after they had dwindled in
unbelief they became a dark, and loathsome, and a <338 people, full
of idleness and all manner of abominations.

1 Nephi Chapter 13

13:1 And it came to pass that the <67 <211 unto me, <377 Look!
And I <419 and <178 many nations and kingdoms.

13:2 And the <22 said unto me: What beholdest thou? And I said: I
behold many <23 and <23

13:3 And he said unto me: These are the <15 and kingdoms of the
Gentiles.

13:4 And it came to pass that I saw <159 the <21 of the Gentiles
the formation of a <353 church.

13:5 And the <67 said unto me: <156 the <17 of a church <389
is most abominable above all other churches, <9 slayeth the saints
of God, yea, and tortureth them and bindeth them down, and yoketh them
with a yoke of iron, and bringeth them down into captivity.

13:6 And it came to pass that I <138 this <70 and <50
church; and I saw the devil that he was the founder of it.

13:7 And I also saw gold, and silver, and silks, and scarlets, and
fine-twined linen, and all <210 of precious clothing; and I saw many
harlots.

13:8 And the <116 <205 unto me, <205 <117 the <36 and the
<38 and the <39 and the <40 and the <40 <40 and
the <39 clothing, and the harlots, are the desires of this <89
and <90 <162

13:9 And also for the praise of the <486 do they destroy the <150 of
God, and bring them down into <133

13:10 And it came to pass that I <273 and <135 many waters; and
they divided the <217 from the seed of my brethren.

13:11 And it came to pass that the <105 said unto me: <104 the wrath
of God is upon the seed of thy <28

13:12 And I <51 and <51 a man <268 the Gentiles, who was
separated from the seed of my <480 by the many <68 and I <22
the Spirit of God, that it came down and wrought upon the man; and he
went <496 upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, who
were in the promised <505

13:13 And it came to pass that I <49 the <48 of God, that it
<46 upon <310 Gentiles; and they went <45 out of captivity, upon
the many waters.

13:14 And it came to pass that I <35 many multitudes of the <154
upon the land of promise; and I <14 the <141 of God, that it was
upon the seed of my brethren; and they were scattered before the
<31 and were smitten.

13:15 And I <32 the <81 of the Lord, that it was upon the
<159 and they did prosper and obtain the land for their
inheritance; and I <27 that they were white, and exceedingly fair
and beautiful, like unto my people <55 they were slain.

13:16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, <31 that the <71 who
had gone <132 out of captivity did humble themselves <31 the Lord;
and the power of the Lord was with them.

13:17 And I <34 that <72 mother <35 were gathered together
upon the <210 and upon the land also, to battle against <27

13:18 And I <27 that the <43 of God was with them, and also that
the <163 of God was upon all those that were <44 <44 <33
them to battle.

13:19 And I, <98 <37 that the <63 that had gone out of
<97 were delivered by the <49 of God out of the hands of all
<252 nations.

13:20 And it came to pass that I, <39 <39 that they did <183
in the land; and I <11 a book, and it was carried <147 <363 <103

13:21 And the <399 said unto me: Knowest thou the meaning of the book?

13:22 And I said unto him: I know not.

13:23 And he said: <425 it proceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew. And
I, <71 <60 it; and he said unto me: The book that thou beholdest
is a record of the Jews, which contains the covenants of the <286
<8 he hath made unto the house of Israel; and it also containeth
many of the prophecies of the holy prophets; and it is a <38 like
unto the engravings <32 are upon the plates of brass, save there are
not so many; nevertheless, they contain the <55 of the <55
<23 he hath made unto the <55 of <55 wherefore, they are of
great worth unto the Gentiles.

13:24 And the <151 of the Lord said unto me: Thou hast <116 that the
book proceeded <175 from the <133 of a Jew; and when it <11
<12 from the <12 of a Jew it contained the fulness of the gospel of
the <71 of whom the twelve apostles bear record; and they bear <109
according to the truth <86 is in the Lamb of God.

13:25 Wherefore, these things go <49 from the Jews in purity unto the
<446 <29 to the <29 <29 is in God.

13:26 And after they go <26 by the hand of the <60 <60 of the
Lamb, from the Jews unto the <34 thou seest the formation of a
<138 and abominable church, <41 is most <5 above all <329
churches; for behold, they have taken away from the <108 of the Lamb
many parts <24 are plain and most precious; and also many <194
of the Lord have they <27 away.

13:27 And all this have they done that they might pervert the right
ways of the <149 that they <11 blind the eyes and harden the hearts
of the children of men.

13:28 <142 thou <95 that <119 the book hath gone <121 through
the <423 of the <103 and <98 <103 that <275 are many <81
and precious <168 <72 away from the <412 <93 is the book of the
Lamb of God.

13:29 And <45 <191 <27 and <26 <26 were <27 away it
goeth <52 unto all the nations of the Gentiles; and <21 it <12
<13 unto all the <13 of the <176 yea, even across the many
waters <55 thou hast seen with the Gentiles <7 have gone <25 out
of captivity, thou seest—because of the many <58 and <58 <58
<18 have been <61 out of the <88 <8 were <15 unto the
understanding of the <138 of men, <262 to the plainness <16
is in the Lamb of God—because of <97 <36 <11 are <34 away out
of the <223 of the <261 an exceedingly <147 many do stumble, yea,
insomuch that Satan hath <10 power over them.

13:30 Nevertheless, thou <493 that the <91 who have gone
<92 out of <91 and have been lifted up by the <28 of God
<285 all <285 nations, upon the face of the land <67 is choice
<14 all <14 lands, <8 is the land that the Lord God hath
covenanted with thy father that his seed should have for the land of
their inheritance; <480 thou <250 that the Lord God will not
suffer that the <77 will utterly destroy the mixture of thy seed,
<49 are among thy brethren.

13:31 Neither will he <25 that the <25 shall <24 the seed
of thy <19

13:32 <19 will the Lord God <21 that the <21 <21 forever
remain in that awful state of blindness, <47 thou <139 they are
in, because of the <206 and most <222 <394 of the <180 of the
Lamb <22 have been kept back by that <331 <331 whose
<444 thou hast seen.

13:33 Wherefore saith the Lamb of God: I will be merciful unto the
<293 unto the visiting of the remnant of the house of Israel in
<215 judgment.

13:34 And it came to pass that the angel of the Lord spake unto me,
saying: Behold, <49 the Lamb of God, <346 I have visited the <41
of the <42 of Israel—and this <8 of whom I speak is the seed of
thy father—wherefore, <25 I have <25 them in judgment, and
smitten them by the hand of the <83 and <18 the <152 do
stumble exceedingly, <139 of the most <140 and <139 <139 of
the <140 of the Lamb <139 have been kept back by that <139
<140 <10 is the mother of harlots, <86 the Lamb—I will be
<133 unto the <45 in that day, <341 that I will bring
<325 unto them, in mine own power, much of my gospel, <36 <218 be
<61 and precious, <37 the Lamb.

13:35 For, behold, <9 the Lamb: I will manifest myself unto thy
<282 that they <28 write many <411 <33 I <6 minister unto
<48 <7 <6 be <39 and precious; and <115 thy seed <9 be
destroyed, and dwindle in unbelief, and also the seed of thy brethren,
<51 <447 <36 <19 be hid up, to come <86 unto the <148
by the gift and <409 of the <78

13:36 And in them <26 be written my <100 <84 the <469 and my
rock and my salvation.

13:37 And blessed are they who <24 seek to <135 <48 my Zion at
that day, for they <13 have the gift and the <54 of the Holy Ghost;
and if they endure unto the end they <20 be <483 up at the last
day, and <10 be saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb; and
whoso <13 publish peace, yea, tidings of <320 joy, how beautiful
upon the mountains <14 they be.

13:38 And it came to pass that I beheld the <303 of the seed of my
<148 and also the book of the Lamb of God, <182 had proceeded
<103 from the mouth of the Jew, that it came <10 from the <260
unto the <38 of the seed of my <480

13:39 And <208 it had come <23 unto them I <60 other books, <44
came <10 by the <134 of the <173 from the <39 unto <241 unto
the convincing of the <9 and the <47 of the seed of my
<85 and also the Jews who were scattered upon all the face of the
earth, that the records of the prophets and of the twelve apostles of
the Lamb are true.

13:40 And the <462 <459 unto me, <458 These last records, <78
thou hast seen among the <273 <163 establish the truth of the
first, <16 are of the <42 <42 of the <93 and <18 make
known the <332 and <432 <310 <19 have been taken away from
them; and <18 make <17 to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that
the Lamb of God is the Son of the Eternal Father, and the Savior of the
world; and that all men must come unto him, or they cannot be saved.

13:41 And they must come according to the words <63 <55 be
established by the <220 of the <281 and the <14 of the Lamb <16
be made <73 in the <151 of thy <443 as well as in the <9 of
the <115 <115 of the <31 wherefore they both <28 be
<44 in one; for there is one God and one Shepherd over all the
earth.

13:42 And the time cometh that he <29 <496 himself unto all
nations, both unto the Jews and also unto the Gentiles; and <278 he
has manifested <20 unto the Jews and also unto the <195 then
he <34 <34 <14 unto the <268 and also unto the Jews, and
the last <15 be <208 and the first <6 be last.

1 Nephi Chapter 14

14:1 And it <16 come to pass, that if the <39 <8 hearken unto
the Lamb of God in that day that he <13 <58 <58 unto them in
word, and also in power, in very deed, unto the taking away of their
stumbling blocks—

14:2 And harden not <11 hearts against the Lamb of God, they <39 be
numbered <302 the seed of thy father; yea, they <12 be <11
<12 the house of Israel; and they <11 be a blessed people upon the
promised land forever; they <12 be no more brought down into
captivity; and the <28 of Israel <14 no more be confounded.

14:3 And that great pit, <267 hath been digged for them by that <10
and abominable church, <13 was founded by the devil and his children,
that he might lead away the souls of men down to hell—yea, that <28
pit <26 hath been <39 for the destruction of men <61 be filled
by those who <13 it, unto <128 utter destruction, saith the Lamb of
God; not the <24 of the soul, save it be the casting of it into
that hell <45 hath no end.

14:4 For behold, this is <367 to the captivity of the devil, and
also <10 to the justice of God, upon all <61 who will work
wickedness and abomination before him.

14:5 And it came to pass that the <508 <508 unto me, Nephi, <509
Thou hast beheld that if the <263 repent it <103 be well with
<479 and thou also knowest concerning the covenants of the Lord unto
the <186 of <214 and thou also hast heard that whoso repenteth not
must perish.

14:6 Therefore, wo be unto the <46 if it so be that they <273
<145 <273 <273 the Lamb of God.

14:7 For the time cometh, <157 the Lamb of God, that I will work a
<193 and a marvelous work <280 the children of men; a work <157
<92 be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the other—either to
the convincing of them unto peace and life eternal, or unto the
deliverance of them to the hardness of <74 <74 and the blindness
of <7 minds unto <3 being <312 down into captivity, and also
into <237 both temporally and spiritually, <196 to the
<207 of the <207 of <70 I have spoken.

14:8 And it came to pass that when the <192 had spoken these words, he
said unto me: Rememberest thou the <177 of the Father unto the
<177 of Israel? I said unto him, Yea.

14:9 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look, and behold that
<145 and <365 <365 <67 is the mother of abominations, whose
founder is the devil.

14:10 And he said unto me: Behold there are save two churches only; the
one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the <11 of
the devil; wherefore, <249 belongeth not to the <11 of the Lamb of
God <11 to that <69 <67 <67 is the <67 of
abominations; and she is the whore of all the earth.

14:11 And it came to pass that I looked and <330 the <20 of all the
earth, and she sat upon many waters; and she had dominion over all the
<15 <263 all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people.

14:12 And it came to pass that I <41 the <84 of the Lamb of God,
and its numbers were few, because of the <413 and abominations of
the <62 who sat upon many <56 nevertheless, I <31 that the
<33 of the Lamb, who were the saints of God, were also upon all the
face of the earth; and <284 dominions upon the face of the earth were
small, <53 of the <53 of the <145 <51 whom I saw.

14:13 And it came to pass that I <58 that the <19 <160 of
<77 did gather together multitudes upon the face of all the
<127 <127 all the nations of the Gentiles, to fight <428 the Lamb
of God.

14:14 And it came to pass that I, <511 <47 the power of the Lamb
of God, that it descended upon the <108 of the <118 of the <118
and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all
the face of the <122 and they were armed with righteousness and with
the <49 of God in <99 glory.

14:15 And it came to pass that I <68 that the wrath of God was
poured out upon that <25 and <357 <290 insomuch that <337
were wars and rumors of wars <121 all the <121 and kindreds of the
<294

14:16 And as <24 began to be wars and <25 of wars <25 all the
<26 <330 belonged to the <171 of <398 the <456 spake
unto me, saying: Behold, the <69 of God is upon the <18 of
harlots; and behold, thou seest all <476 things—

14:17 And when the day cometh that the <28 of God is <96 out upon
the <31 of harlots, <56 is the <103 and <103 <169 of all
the <219 <459 <458 is the devil, then, at that day, the work of
the Father shall commence, in preparing the way for the fulfilling of
his covenants, <40 he hath made to his <200 who are of the house of
Israel.

14:18 And it came to pass that the <114 <114 unto me, <113 Look!

14:19 And I <437 and <192 a man, and he was dressed in a white
robe.

14:20 And the <32 said unto me: Behold one of the twelve apostles of
the Lamb.

14:21 <158 he <91 see and write the remainder of <150 things;
yea, and also many things <93 have been.

14:22 And he <24 also <23 concerning the end of the world.

14:23 Wherefore, the <25 <25 he <18 <17 are just and true; and
behold they are written in the book <17 thou <97 proceeding out of
the mouth of the Jew; and at the time they proceeded out of the <13
of the Jew, or, at the time the book <15 out of the <15 of the
Jew, the <60 <43 were <49 were plain and pure, and most
precious and easy to the understanding of all men.

14:24 And <271 the <27 <27 this apostle of the Lamb <91 <91
are many <12 <12 thou hast seen; and <20 the <141 shalt
thou see.

14:25 But the <19 <19 thou <13 see hereafter thou <4 not
write; for the Lord God hath ordained the <46 of the Lamb of God
that he should <51 them.

14:26 And also others who have been, to them hath he shown all things,
and they have <106 them; and they are sealed up to come forth in
their purity, according to the truth <68 is in the <508 in the own
due time of the <508 unto the <309 of <308

14:27 And I, Nephi, heard and bear record, that the name of the <86
of the Lamb was John, <46 to the word of the angel.

14:28 And <136 I, <31 am forbidden that I <103 <103 the
<145 of the <137 <69 I saw and heard; wherefore the <8
<9 I have <99 sufficeth me; and I have <6 but a small part
of the <19 <18 I saw.

14:29 And I bear record that I saw the <16 <16 my father saw, and
the <365 of the Lord did make them known unto me.

14:30 And now I make an end of speaking <340 the <32 <32 I
saw while I was carried away in the spirit; and if all the <17 <17
I saw are not written, the <9 <9 I have <86 are true. And
thus it is. Amen.

1 Nephi Chapter 15

15:1 And it came to pass that after I, <145 had been <53 away in
the spirit, and seen all <432 <237 I returned to the tent of my
father.

15:2 And it came to pass that I <402 my brethren, and they were
disputing one with another <105 the <79 my <136 had spoken
unto <295

15:3 For he truly spake many great <18 unto them, <99 were hard to
be understood, save a man <218 inquire of the Lord; and they being
hard in <296 hearts, therefore they did not look unto the Lord as they
ought.

15:4 And now I, <110 was grieved because of the hardness of <29
<30 and also, <10 of the <61 <59 I had seen, and knew they
must unavoidably come to pass <17 of the <79 wickedness of the
children of men.

15:5 And it came to pass that I was overcome <24 of my afflictions,
for I considered that mine afflictions were <33 above all, <15 of
the destruction of my people, for I had <156 <73 fall.

15:6 And it came to pass that <205 I had received strength I <147
unto my <177 desiring to know of them the cause of <31
disputations.

15:7 And they said: Behold, we cannot understand the words <111 our
<192 hath <192 <199 the natural branches of the olive-tree,
and also <10 the Gentiles.

15:8 And I said unto them: Have ye inquired of the Lord?

15:9 And they said unto me: We have not; for the Lord maketh no such
thing <367 unto us.

15:10 <67 I said unto <38 How is it that ye do not keep the
commandments of the <46 How is it that ye will perish, <146 of the
<213 of your hearts?

15:11 Do ye not remember the <216 <105 the Lord hath said?—If ye
will not harden your <234 and ask me in faith, believing that ye
shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely <361
<33 <12 be made <87 unto you.

15:12 <87 I say unto you, that the house of Israel was compared
unto an <151 by the Spirit of the Lord <65 was in our father;
and behold are we not broken off from the <30 of Israel, and are we
not a branch of the <12 of Israel?

15:13 And now, the <154 <38 our <207 meaneth <196 the
grafting in of the <211 <211 through the fulness of the
Gentiles, is, that in the latter days, when our seed <99 have
dwindled in unbelief, yea, for the space of many years, and many
generations <289 the Messiah <20 be manifested in body unto the
<355 of men, then <12 the <48 of the gospel of the <21
come unto the <55 and from the Gentiles unto the remnant of our
seed—

15:14 And at that day <33 the <15 of our seed know that they are
of the <118 of <130 and that they are the covenant people of the
<484 and then <29 they know and come to the knowledge of <356
forefathers, and also to the <9 of the <76 of <12 Redeemer,
<147 was ministered unto <7 fathers by him; wherefore, they <34
come to the <23 of <13 Redeemer and the very points of his
doctrine, that they may know how to come unto him and be saved.

15:15 And then at that day will they not rejoice and give praise unto
<40 everlasting God, <3 rock and <3 salvation? Yea, at that
day, will they not receive the <461 and nourishment from the true
vine? Yea, will they not come unto the true fold of God?

15:16 <305 I say unto you, Yea; they <95 be remembered again among
the <152 of Israel; they <11 be grafted in, being a <258 <284
of the <319 into the true olive-tree.

15:17 And this is what our <286 meaneth; and he <289 that it will
not come to pass until <256 they are scattered by the Gentiles; and he
<20 that it <52 come by way of the <247 that the Lord may
show his power unto the <11 for the very cause that he <24 be
rejected of the Jews, or of the <90 of Israel.

15:18 Wherefore, our <70 hath not spoken of our seed alone, but also
of all the <23 of <265 pointing to the <263 <232 should be
fulfilled in the <362 days; <9 <11 the Lord made to our
<38 Abraham, saying: In thy seed <63 all the kindreds of the earth
be blessed.

15:19 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake much unto them
<425 <503 things; yea, I <10 unto them <8 the
restoration of the Jews in the <60 days.

15:20 And I did rehearse unto them the words of Isaiah, who <29
<28 the <27 of the <125 or of the <102 of <215 and
<177 they were restored they <104 no more be confounded, neither
<7 they be <189 again. And it came to pass that I did speak
many <48 unto my brethren, that they were pacified and did humble
themselves before the Lord.

15:21 And it came to pass that they did <31 unto me again, <141
What <230 this thing <157 our <151 saw in a dream? What <11
the tree <12 he saw?

15:22 And I said unto them: It was a representation of the tree of
life.

15:23 And they said unto me: What <36 the rod of iron <37 our
<50 saw, that led to the tree?

15:24 And I said unto them that it was the word of God, and whoso would
hearken unto the word of God, and <9 hold fast unto it, they <6
never perish; <152 could the temptations and the fiery darts of the
adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to
destruction.

15:25 <312 I, <247 did exhort them to give heed unto the word
of the Lord; yea, I did <15 them with all the energies of my soul,
and with all the faculty <108 I possessed, that they <70 give heed
to the word of God and remember to keep his commandments always in all
things.

15:26 And they said unto me: What <148 the river of water <40 our
<148 saw?

15:27 And I said unto them that the <17 <17 my <16 saw was
filthiness; and so much was his mind swallowed up in other things that
he beheld not the filthiness of the water.

15:28 And I said unto them that it was an awful gulf, <43 separated
the wicked from the tree of life, and also from the saints of God.

15:29 And I said unto them that it was a <260 of that <35
hell, <36 the angel said unto me was prepared for the wicked.

15:30 And I said unto them that our <99 also saw that the justice of
God did also divide the <67 from the righteous; and the brightness
thereof was like unto the <7 of a flaming fire, <53 ascendeth
up unto God forever and ever, and hath no end.

15:31 And they said unto me: Doth this <371 mean the torment of the
body in the days of probation, or doth it mean the final state of the
soul <460 the death of the temporal body, or doth it <414 of the
<177 <63 are temporal?

15:32 And it came to pass that I said unto them that it was a
<144 of <25 both <36 and spiritual; for the day
<496 come that they must be judged of their works, yea, even the
works <48 were done by the <27 body in <15 days of probation.

15:33 <350 if they <34 die in <14 wickedness they must be
cast off also, as to the <58 <35 are spiritual, <3 are
pertaining to righteousness; wherefore, they must be brought to stand
before God, to be <65 of <36 works; and if <4 <64 have been
<286 they must needs be filthy; and if they be filthy it must
<11 be that they cannot dwell in the kingdom of God; if so, the
<7 of God must be <24 also.

15:34 But behold, I say unto you, the <18 of God is not filthy, and
there <38 any unclean <213 enter into the <16 of God; wherefore
<13 must <56 be a place of <75 <300 for that <108 is
filthy.

15:35 And <20 is a <18 prepared, yea, even that <330 hell of <20
I have spoken, and the devil is the preparator of it; <46 the
<251 <251 of the souls of men is to <105 in the <64 of God, or
to be cast out because of that <343 of <42 I have spoken.

15:36 <200 the <347 are rejected from the righteous, and also
from that tree of <422 whose fruit is most precious and most desirable
above all <470 fruits; yea, and it is the greatest of all the gifts of
God. And thus I spake unto my brethren. Amen.

1 Nephi Chapter 16

16:1 And now it came to pass that <347 I, Nephi, had made an end of
speaking to my brethren, behold they said unto me: Thou hast declared
unto us hard things, more than we are able to bear.

16:2 And it came to pass that I said unto them that I knew that I had
spoken hard <306 against the wicked, according to the truth; and the
righteous have I justified, and testified that they <340 be lifted up
at the last day; <324 the guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for
it cutteth them to the very center.

16:3 And now my <97 if ye were <46 and were willing to
hearken to the truth, and give heed unto it, that ye might walk
uprightly <366 God, then ye would not murmur <222 of the <22
and say: Thou speakest hard <95 <95 us.

16:4 And it came to pass that I, <163 did exhort my <60 with
all diligence, to keep the commandments of the Lord.

16:5 And it came to pass that they did humble themselves <61 the
Lord; insomuch that I had joy and great hopes of them, that they <73
walk in the paths of righteousness.

16:6 Now, all these <75 were said and done as my father dwelt in a
tent in the valley <318 he called Lemuel.

16:7 And it came to pass that I, <92 took one of the daughters of
Ishmael to wife; and also, my brethren took of the <13 of <12
to <13 and also Zoram took the eldest daughter of <12 to wife.

16:8 And thus my <66 had fulfilled all the <127 of the Lord
<67 had been given unto him. And <47 I, <61 had been blessed of
the Lord exceedingly.

16:9 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord <365 unto my
<47 by night, and commanded him that on the morrow he <282 take
his journey into the wilderness.

16:10 And it came to pass that as my <31 arose in the morning, and
went forth to the tent door, to his <187 astonishment he beheld upon
the ground a round ball of curious workmanship; and it was of fine
brass. And within the ball were two spindles; and the one pointed the
way whither we <72 go into the <69

16:11 And it came to pass that we did gather together whatsoever <223
we <23 carry into the wilderness, and all the remainder of our
provisions <156 the Lord had <157 unto us; and we did take seed of
every kind that we <353 <31 into the <54

16:12 And it came to pass that we did take our tents and depart into
the <52 across the river Laman.

16:13 And it came to pass that we traveled for the space of four days,
nearly a south-southeast direction, and we did pitch our <39 again;
and we did call the name of the place Shazer.

16:14 And it came to pass that we did take our bows and our arrows, and
go <190 into the wilderness to slay food for our families; and after
we had slain food for our families we did return again to our <7
in the <97 to the <56 of <57 And we did go <40 <18 in
the <15 following the same <89 keeping in the most
fertile parts of the <14 <170 were in the borders near the Red
Sea.

16:15 And it came to pass that we did travel for the <133 of many
<134 slaying food by the way, with our bows and our arrows and our
stones and our slings.

16:16 And we did follow the directions of the ball, <61 led us in the
more <73 <73 of the <220

16:17 And <127 we had <192 for the <59 of many <58 we did
<187 our <187 for the <12 of a time, that we <254 <122 rest
ourselves and obtain food for our families.

16:18 And it came to pass that as I, <442 went <147 to slay food,
behold, I did break my bow, <77 was made of fine steel; and <67 I
did <14 my bow, <20 my brethren were angry with me because of the
loss of my bow, for we did <62 no food.

16:19 And it came to pass that we did <223 without food to our
families, and being much fatigued, <37 of their journeying, they
did suffer much for the want of <37

16:20 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael
did begin to murmur exceedingly, <38 of <38 sufferings and
afflictions in the wilderness; and also my <505 began to <18
against the Lord his God; yea, and they were all exceedingly sorrowful,
even that they did <19 <18 the Lord.

16:21 Now it came to pass that I, <159 having been afflicted with my
<137 <58 of the loss of my bow, and <64 bows <17 lost
<5 springs, it <60 to be <49 difficult, yea, insomuch that
we could <149 no <112

16:22 And it came to pass that I, <49 did speak much unto my
brethren, <49 they had hardened <40 hearts again, even unto
complaining <82 the Lord <10 God.

16:23 And it came to pass that I, <35 did make out of wood a bow,
and out of a straight stick, an arrow; wherefore, I did arm myself with
a bow and an arrow, with a sling and with stones. And I said unto my
father: Whither shall I go to <96 food?

16:24 And it came to pass that he did inquire of the Lord, for they had
humbled themselves <98 of my words; for I did say many things unto
them in the energy of my soul.

16:25 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my
father; and he was truly chastened <44 of his murmuring <135 the
<58 <177 that he was brought down into the depths of sorrow.

16:26 And it came to pass that the <44 of the Lord said unto him:
Look upon the <464 and behold the <80 <391 are written.

16:27 And it came to pass that when my <297 beheld the <19 <19
were written upon the <30 he did fear and tremble <327 and
also my <274 and the sons of <343 and our wives.

16:28 And it came to pass that I, <217 <41 the pointers <41 were
in the <40 that they did work according to the faith and diligence
and heed <19 we did give unto them.

16:29 And there was also <71 upon them a new writing, <20 was
plain to be read, <7 did give us understanding concerning the ways
of the Lord; and it was <28 and changed from time to time,
<59 to the <59 and <59 <29 we gave unto it. And thus we
see that by small means the Lord can bring about great things.

16:30 And it came to pass that I, <111 did go forth up into the top
of the mountain, <50 to the directions <48 were given upon the
ball.

16:31 And it came to pass that I did slay wild beasts, <243 that I
did <324 food for our families.

16:32 And it came to pass that I did return to our tents, bearing the
beasts <52 I had slain; and now when they <186 that I had obtained
food, how <97 was <427 joy! And it came to pass that they did humble
<356 before the <307 and did give thanks unto him.

16:33 And it came to pass that we did again take our journey, traveling
nearly the same course as in the beginning; and after we had traveled
for the space of many days we did pitch our tents <500 that we might
tarry for the <17 of a time.

16:34 And it came to pass that <299 died, and was buried in the
place <114 was called Nahom.

16:35 And it came to pass that the daughters of <26 did mourn
<339 <417 of the loss of <123 father, and <8 of <5
afflictions in the wilderness; and they did murmur <433 my <16
<16 he had <432 them out of the land of Jerusalem, saying: Our
<394 is dead; yea, and we have wandered much in the wilderness, and
we have suffered much affliction, hunger, thirst, and fatigue; and
<132 all these sufferings we must perish in the wilderness with
hunger.

16:36 And thus they did <65 <65 my <65 and also <5 me;
and they were desirous to <242 <183 to Jerusalem.

16:37 And Laman said unto Lemuel and also unto the sons of Ishmael:
Behold, let us slay our <37 and also our brother <333 who has
taken it upon him to be our ruler and our teacher, who are his elder
brethren.

16:38 Now, he says that the Lord has talked with him, and also that
angels have ministered unto him. But behold, we know that he lies unto
us; and he tells us <122 things, and he worketh many things by his
cunning arts, that he may deceive our eyes, thinking, perhaps, that he
may lead us away into some strange <202 and <156 he has led us
away, he has thought to make himself a king and a <96 over us, that
he may do with us <438 to his will and pleasure. And <34 this
manner did my <131 <153 stir up <253 hearts to anger.

16:39 And it came to pass that the Lord was with us, yea, even the
voice of the Lord came and did speak many words unto them, and did
chasten them exceedingly; and <52 they were chastened by the <25 of
the Lord they did turn away <57 anger, and did repent of <6 sins,
<495 that the Lord did bless us <237 with <460 that we did not
perish.

1 Nephi Chapter 17

17:1 And it came to pass that we did <28 take our journey in the
<154 and we did travel <454 eastward from that time forth. And
we did <11 and wade through much affliction in the <23 and
our women did bear children in the wilderness.

17:2 And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we
did live upon raw meat in the <382 our <35 did give plenty of
suck for <115 children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men;
and they began to bear <17 journeyings without murmurings.

17:3 And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled.
And if it so be that the <85 of men keep the <19 of God
he doth nourish <201 and strengthen <3 and provide means whereby
they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them; wherefore,
he did <18 <18 for us <104 we did sojourn in the <127

17:4 And we did <11 for the space of many years, yea, even eight
years in the <22

17:5 And we did come to the land <53 we called Bountiful, because of
its much fruit and also wild honey; and all <394 <389 were prepared
of the Lord that we might not <249 And we beheld the sea, <34 we
<35 Irreantum, which, being interpreted, is many waters.

17:6 And it came to pass that we did pitch our tents by the seashore;
and notwithstanding we had suffered many afflictions and much
difficulty, yea, even so much that we cannot write them all, we were
exceedingly rejoiced when we came to the <33 and we <61 the
place <99 <99 of its much fruit.

17:7 And it came to pass that <378 I, Nephi, had been in the land of
Bountiful for the <154 of many days, the <390 of the Lord came unto
me, saying: Arise, and get thee into the mountain. And it came to pass
that I arose and went up into the mountain, and cried unto the Lord.

17:8 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, <43 Thou
shalt construct a ship, <76 the <505 <163 I shall show thee, that
I may carry thy people across <194 <167

17:9 And I said: Lord, whither <22 I go that I may find ore to
molten, that I may make tools to <47 the ship <47 the <47
<48 thou hast shown unto me?

17:10 And it came to pass that the Lord told me <45 I should go to
find ore, that I <249 make tools.

17:11 And it came to pass that I, <169 did make a bellows wherewith
to blow the fire, of the skins of beasts; and <65 I had made a
bellows, that I <40 have <23 to blow the <22 I did smite two
stones together that I <16 make fire.

17:12 For the Lord had not hitherto <276 that we <80 make much
<30 as we journeyed in the wilderness; for he <142 I will make thy
food become sweet, that ye cook it not;

17:13 And I will also be your light in the <30 and I will
prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye <182 keep my
commandments; <456 inasmuch as ye <9 keep my <489 ye
<6 be led towards the promised land; and ye <9 know that it is by
me that ye are led.

17:14 Yea, and the Lord said also that: After ye have arrived in the
<34 land, ye <33 know that I, the <246 am God; and that I, the
<8 did deliver you from destruction; yea, that I did bring you out
of the land of Jerusalem.

17:15 Wherefore, I, <209 did strive to keep the <89 of the
<35 and I did exhort my brethren to faithfulness and diligence.

17:16 And it came to pass that I did make <296 of the ore <291 I did
molten out of the rock.

17:17 And when my <38 saw that I was about to build a <368 they
began to murmur against me, <382 Our brother is a fool, for he
thinketh that he can <23 a ship; yea, and he also <11 that he
can cross <385 great <386

17:18 And thus my <53 did complain <41 me, and were desirous
that they <285 not labor, for they did not believe that I could <45
a <46 neither would they <11 that I was instructed of the <470

17:19 And now it came to pass that I, <156 was exceedingly sorrowful
because of the hardness of their hearts; and now when they saw that I
<110 to be <20 they were glad in <18 hearts, insomuch that
they did rejoice over me, <123 We knew that ye <71 not <461 a
<141 for we knew that ye were lacking in judgment; <304 thou
canst not accomplish so <123 a work.

17:20 And thou art like unto our father, led away by the foolish
imaginations of his heart; yea, he hath led us out of the land of
Jerusalem, and we have wandered in the wilderness for <168 many years;
and our women have toiled, being big with child; and they have borne
children in the <23 and <442 all things, save it were death;
and it <164 have been better that they had died <409 they came out
of Jerusalem than to have <28 <52 afflictions.

17:21 Behold, <7 many years we have <13 in the wilderness,
<296 time we <219 have enjoyed our possessions and the land of our
inheritance; yea, and we <15 have been happy.

17:22 And we know that the people who were in the land of <60
were a righteous people; for they kept the statutes and judgments of
the <378 and all his commandments, according to the law of Moses;
<186 we know that they are a <31 <31 and our father
hath judged them, and hath led us away <260 we <125 hearken unto
his words; yea, and our <359 is like unto him. And after this manner
of language did my <339 <379 and <340 <340 us.

17:23 And it came to pass that I, <307 spake unto <51 <273 Do ye
<335 that our fathers, who were the <195 of Israel, <58 have
been led away out of the hands of the Egyptians if they had not
hearkened unto the words of the Lord?

17:24 Yea, do ye suppose that they <35 have been led out of bondage,
if the Lord had not commanded Moses that he should lead them out of
bondage?

17:25 Now ye know that the <71 of Israel were in bondage; and ye
know that they were laden with tasks, <231 were grievous to be borne;
<172 ye know that it must needs be a good thing for <118 that
they <55 be brought out of bondage.

17:26 Now ye know that <72 was <75 of the Lord to do that <390
work; and ye know that by his word the waters of the Red Sea were
divided hither and thither, and they passed through on dry ground.

17:27 But ye know that the <156 were drowned in the Red Sea, who
were the armies of Pharaoh.

17:28 And ye also know that they were fed with manna in the wilderness.

17:29 Yea, and ye also know that Moses, by his word <301 to the
power of God <136 was in him, smote the rock, and there came forth
water, that the <167 of <167 <367 quench their thirst.

17:30 And notwithstanding they <456 led, the Lord <13 God, <2
Redeemer, going <434 <157 leading them by day and giving light unto
them by night, and doing all things for them <59 were expedient for
man to receive, they hardened <34 hearts and blinded <4 minds, and
reviled <329 <178 and <3 the true and living God.

17:31 And it came to pass that <104 to his word he did destroy
them; and <10 to his word he did lead <9 and <9 to his
word he did do all <69 for <13 and <121 was not any <252 done
save it were by his word.

17:32 And <410 they had crossed the river Jordan he did make them
mighty unto the driving out of the <151 of the land, yea, unto the
scattering them to destruction.

17:33 And now, do ye <374 that the <23 of this <23 who were
in the land of promise, who were driven out by our <434 do ye
<25 that they were righteous? Behold, I say unto you, Nay.

17:34 Do ye <17 that our fathers <417 have been more choice than
they if they had been <29 I say unto you, Nay.

17:35 <38 the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one; he that is righteous
is favored of God. But behold, this people had rejected every word of
God, and they were ripe in iniquity; and the fulness of the wrath of
God was upon <172 and the Lord did curse the land <226 <268 and
bless it unto our fathers; yea, he did <15 it <14 them unto <251
destruction, and he did <19 it unto our <103 unto <12 obtaining
<342 over it.

17:36 <92 the Lord hath created the earth that it <468 be
inhabited; and he hath <12 his <175 that they <12 possess
it.

17:37 And he raiseth up a <115 nation, and destroyeth the nations
of the wicked.

17:38 And he leadeth away the <19 into precious lands, and the
wicked he destroyeth, and curseth the land unto them for <80 sakes.

17:39 He ruleth high in the heavens, for it is his throne, and this
<84 is his footstool.

17:40 And he loveth those who will have him to be <38 God. <110 he
loved our <254 and he covenanted with <158 yea, even Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob; and he remembered the covenants <420 he had made;
wherefore, he did bring them out of the land of Egypt.

17:41 And he did straiten them in the wilderness with his rod; for they
<445 <60 hearts, even as ye have; and the Lord straitened them
because of <14 iniquity. He sent fiery flying serpents among <237
and <392 they were bitten he prepared a way that they might be healed;
and the labor <77 they had to perform was to look; and <39 of the
simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, <449 were many who
perished.

17:42 And they did harden <64 hearts from time to time, and they did
revile <282 Moses, and also <4 God; nevertheless, ye know that
they were led forth by his matchless <282 into the land of promise.

17:43 And now, <94 all these things, the time has come that they have
become wicked, yea, nearly unto ripeness; and I know not but they are
at this day about to be destroyed; for I know that the day must surely
come that they must be destroyed, save a few only, who shall be led
away into captivity.

17:44 Wherefore, the Lord commanded my father that he <338 depart
into the wilderness; and the Jews also sought to take away his life;
yea, and ye also have <12 to take away his <12 <249 ye are
murderers in your <147 and ye are like unto them.

17:45 Ye are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord your
God. Ye have seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard
his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still
small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel his
words; <79 he has <25 unto you like unto the <39 of
thunder, <269 did cause the <393 to shake as if it were to divide
asunder.

17:46 And ye also know that by the <230 of his almighty word he can
<32 the <32 that it <178 pass away; yea, and ye know that by his
word he can <19 the rough places to be made smooth, and smooth <7
<26 be broken up. O, then, why is it, that ye can be so hard in your
hearts?

17:47 <457 my soul is rent with anguish <355 of you, and my heart
is pained; I fear lest ye <43 be cast off forever. <25 I am full
of the Spirit of God, insomuch that my frame has no strength.

17:48 And now it came to pass that when I had <154 <335 words, they
were angry with me, and were desirous to throw me into the depths of
the sea; and as they came <378 to lay <406 hands upon me I <230 unto
them, saying: In the name of the Almighty God, I command you that ye
touch me not, for I am filled with the <179 of God, even unto the
consuming of my flesh; and whoso <110 lay his <47 upon me <6
wither even as a dried reed; and he <10 be as naught before the <35
of God, for God <12 smite him.

17:49 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto them that they
<387 murmur no more <489 <99 father; neither <8 they
withhold <7 labor from me, for God had <411 me that I <15
build a ship.

17:50 And I said unto them: If God had <21 me to do all things I
<334 do <396 If he <30 <130 me that I <5 say unto this
water, be thou earth, it <10 be earth; and if I <6 say it, it
would be done.

17:51 And now, if the Lord has such great power, and has wrought so
many miracles among the children of men, how is it that he cannot
instruct me, that I <44 <94 a ship?

17:52 And it came to pass that I, <140 said many <91 unto my
brethren, <285 that they were confounded and <99 not contend
<147 me; <146 durst they lay <145 <204 upon me nor <233 me
with <9 fingers, even for the space of many days. Now they <23 not
do this lest they <66 <226 <215 me, so powerful was the <339
of God; and thus it had <103 upon <152

17:53 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Stretch <316
thine hand again unto thy <86 and they <250 not <46 <46
thee, but I will shock <325 saith the Lord, and this will I do, that
they may know that I am the Lord <92 God.

17:54 And it came to pass that I stretched <53 my hand unto my
<52 and they did not <52 <52 me; but the Lord did shake
<53 even according to the word which he had spoken.

17:55 And now, they said: We know of a surety that the Lord is with
<87 for we know that it is the <356 of the Lord that has shaken us.
And they fell down <58 me, and were about to worship me, but I <273
not suffer <64 <442 I am thy brother, yea, even thy younger
brother; wherefore, <21 the Lord thy God, and honor thy father and
thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land <93 the Lord thy
God <168 give thee.

1 Nephi Chapter 18

18:1 And it came to pass that they did <50 the <179 and did go
<154 with me; and we did work timbers of curious workmanship. And the
Lord did show me from time to time after what manner I <268 work the
<23 of the <432

18:2 Now I, <333 did not work the <15 <24 the <24 <84 was
learned by men, <328 did I <365 the ship <15 the <15 of men;
but I did <12 it <11 the <11 <26 the Lord had shown unto me;
<141 it was not <15 the <15 of men.

18:3 And I, <58 did go into the mount oft, and I did pray oft unto
the Lord; wherefore the Lord showed unto me <453 things.

18:4 And it came to pass that <45 I had finished the ship, <270
to the word of the <150 my brethren beheld that it was good, and that
the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine; <79 they did
humble themselves <371 <253 the Lord.

18:5 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my
father, that we <168 arise and go down into the <168

18:6 And it came to pass that on the morrow, <83 we had prepared all
things, much fruits and meat from the wilderness, and honey in
abundance, and provisions <98 to that <164 the Lord had
commanded us, we did go down into the <115 with all our loading and
our seeds, and whatsoever thing we had brought with us, every one
<36 to his age; <114 we did all go down into the <32 with
our wives and our children.

18:7 And now, my <348 had begat two sons in the wilderness; the elder
was called Jacob and the <376 Joseph.

18:8 And it came to pass <111 we had all gone down into the <50 and
had taken with us our <107 and things <106 had been <104
us, we did put <354 into the sea and were driven <7 <193 the wind
towards the promised land.

18:9 And <49 we had been <19 <19 <19 the wind for the space
of many days, behold, my <246 and the sons of Ishmael and also
their <115 began to make <240 merry, insomuch that they <8 to
dance, and to sing, and to speak with much rudeness, yea, even that
they did forget by what power they had been <172 thither; yea, they
were lifted up unto exceeding rudeness.

18:10 And I, <357 <44 to fear <299 lest the Lord <269 be
angry with us, and smite us because of our iniquity, that we <15 be
swallowed up in the depths of the sea; <213 I, <36 <36 to
<74 to them with much soberness; but behold they were <39 with me,
saying: We will not that our <200 brother shall be a ruler over us.

18:11 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel did take me and bind me
with cords, and they did treat me with much harshness; nevertheless,
the Lord did suffer it that he might show <184 his power, unto the
fulfilling of his word <229 he had spoken concerning the wicked.

18:12 And it came to pass that <216 they had bound me <187 that I
could not move, the compass, <31 had been <390 of the <466 did
cease to work.

18:13 Wherefore, they knew not whither they <149 steer the <296
<36 that there arose a great storm, yea, a <4 and terrible
tempest, and we were <270 back upon the waters for the <270 of three
days; and they <171 to be frightened <208 lest they <43 be
drowned in the sea; nevertheless they did not loose me.

18:14 And on the fourth day, <87 we had been <47 back, the tempest
<38 to be <37 sore.

18:15 And it came to pass that we were about to be <240 up in the
<241 of the sea. And <140 we had been <39 back upon the <86
for the <87 of four <356 my <355 <48 to see that the judgments
of God were upon them, and that they must perish save that they <99
repent of <371 iniquities; <286 they came unto me, and loosed
the bands <93 were upon my wrist, and <289 they had swollen
exceedingly; and also mine ankles were much swollen, and <164 was the
soreness thereof.

18:16 Nevertheless, I did look unto my God, and I did praise him all
the day long; and I did not murmur against the Lord <368 of mine
afflictions.

18:17 Now my father, Lehi, had said many <512 unto <98 and also
unto the sons of Ishmael; but, <477 they did breathe out much
threatenings <39 anyone that <110 <385 for me; and my parents
being stricken in years, and having suffered much grief <56 of
<126 children, they were <465 down, yea, even upon <9 sick-beds.

18:18 Because of <8 <22 and much sorrow, and the iniquity of my
brethren, they were <27 near even to be carried out of this time to
meet <27 God; yea, <3 grey hairs were <232 to be <23 down to
lie low in the dust; yea, even they were near to be cast with sorrow
into a watery grave.

18:19 And Jacob and Joseph also, <99 young, <96 need of much
nourishment, were grieved <100 of the afflictions of <55 mother;
and also my wife with her tears and prayers, and also my <116 did
not soften the hearts of my <277 that they would <348 me.

18:20 And <402 was nothing save it were the power of God, <261
threatened them with destruction, <452 <33 <53 hearts; <281
when they saw that they were <114 to be <346 up in the <345 of
the sea they repented of the thing <35 they had done, <453 that
they <308 me.

18:21 And it came to pass <369 they had <14 me, <237 I took the
<506 and it did work <490 I desired it. And it came to pass that
I prayed unto the Lord; and <32 I had <8 the winds did cease, and
the storm did <6 and <111 was a <345 calm.

18:22 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did guide the ship, that we
sailed again towards the promised land.

18:23 And it came to pass that <55 we had <19 for the <450 of
many days we did arrive at the <28 land; and we went forth upon
the land, and did pitch our tents; and we did call it the <21
<50

18:24 And it came to pass that we did begin to till the earth, and we
<498 to plant seeds; yea, we did put all our seeds into the <17
<181 we had <312 from the land of Jerusalem. And it came to pass
that they did grow <485 <226 we were blessed in
abundance.

18:25 And it came to pass that we did find upon the land of promise, as
we journeyed in the wilderness, that <168 were beasts in the forests
of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and the ass and the horse, and
the goat and the wild goat, and all manner of wild animals, <89 were
for the use of men. And we did find all <17 of ore, both of gold,
and of silver, and of copper.

1 Nephi Chapter 19

19:1 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I did
make plates of ore that I might engraven upon them the record of my
people. And upon the <18 <71 I made I did <18 the <16 of
my father, and also our journeyings in the <127 and the
prophecies of my father; and also many of mine own <10 have I
<31 upon them.

19:2 And I knew not at the time when I made them that I should be
<85 of the Lord to make these plates; <207 the <62 of my
<62 and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more part of all our
proceedings in the wilderness are <57 upon those first <98 of
<100 I have spoken; <37 the things <7 transpired before I
made <48 <17 are, of a truth, more particularly made mention upon
the <30 plates.

19:3 And <368 I had made <24 <24 by way of commandment, I, <403
received a commandment that the ministry and the prophecies, the more
plain and precious parts of them, <108 be written upon <31 <103
and that the <68 <68 were <11 <14 be kept for the
instruction of my people, who <11 possess the <402 and also for
other wise purposes, <25 purposes are known unto the Lord.

19:4 Wherefore, I, <69 did make a <148 upon the <23 plates,
<23 gives an account, or <5 <5 a greater account of the wars
and contentions and destructions of my <248 And this have I done,
and <192 my people what they <67 do <125 I was gone; and that
<97 <128 <11 be handed down from one generation to another, or
from one prophet to <7 until further commandments of the <82

19:5 And an <63 of my making <34 <34 shall be given hereafter;
and then, behold, I proceed according to that <86 I have <214 and
this I do that the more sacred <153 may be kept for the knowledge of
my <94

19:6 Nevertheless, I do not write anything upon <49 save it be that
I think it be sacred. And now, if I do err, even did they err of old;
not that I would excuse myself because of <161 men, but <5 of the
weakness <75 is in me, <82 to the flesh, I <22 <22 myself.

19:7 For the <80 <19 some men esteem to be of great worth, both to
the body and soul, others set at naught and trample under their feet.
Yea, even the very God of Israel do men <14 <14 <14 feet; I
say, <7 <7 <7 feet but I <58 speak in <78 words—they set
him at naught, and hearken not to the voice of his counsels.

19:8 And behold he cometh, <90 to the words of the angel, in six
hundred years from the time my father left Jerusalem.

19:9 And the world, <125 of <59 iniquity, <212 judge him to be a
thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and
they smite him, and he <9 it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he
<10 it, <41 of his loving kindness and his long-suffering
towards the children of men.

19:10 And the God of our <494 who were led out of Egypt, out of
bondage, and also were preserved in the <499 by him, yea, the God
of Abraham, and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, yieldeth himself,
<127 to the <127 of the <127 as a man, into the hands of wicked
men, to be lifted up, <21 to the <21 of Zenock, and to be
crucified, <11 to the <11 of Neum, and to be buried in a
sepulchre, <14 to the <14 of Zenos, <254 he spake concerning
the three days of darkness, <10 <406 be a sign <374 of his death
unto those who <12 inhabit the isles of the sea, more especially
<18 unto <14 who are of the house of Israel.

19:11 For thus <47 the prophet: The Lord God surely <205 visit all
the <21 of <285 at that day, some with his voice, <183 of <224
righteousness, unto <4 <325 joy and salvation, and <321 with the
thunderings and the lightnings of his power, by tempest, by fire, and
by smoke, and vapor of <96 and by the opening of the earth, and
by mountains <107 <62 be carried up.

19:12 And all <491 <384 must <76 come, saith the prophet Zenos.
And the rocks of the earth must rend; and <76 of the groanings of
the <42 many of the kings of the <135 of the sea <47 be wrought
upon by the Spirit of God, to exclaim: The God of nature suffers.

19:13 And as for <154 who are at Jerusalem, <61 the prophet, they
<34 be scourged by all people, <58 they crucify the God of
Israel, and turn <138 hearts aside, rejecting signs and wonders, and
the power and glory of the God of <190

19:14 And <33 they turn <26 <26 <26 <50 the <50 and
have despised the Holy One of <43 they <58 wander in the flesh,
and perish, and become a hiss and a byword, and be hated among all
nations.

19:15 Nevertheless, when that day <467 <44 the <44 that they
no more turn aside <57 <57 against the Holy One of <50 then
will he remember the covenants <196 he made to <19 fathers.

19:16 Yea, then will he <17 the <168 of the sea; yea, and all the
people who are of the <282 of <40 will I gather in, <62 the
Lord, <360 to the <360 of the <225 <362 from the four
quarters of the earth.

19:17 Yea, and all the <235 <122 see the salvation of the <32 <36
the prophet; every nation, kindred, tongue and <57 <17 be blessed.

19:18 And I, Nephi, have written <280 <280 unto my <208 that
perhaps I might persuade them that they would <96 the Lord <109
Redeemer.

19:19 Wherefore, I speak unto all the <96 of <96 if it so be that
they <426 obtain <43 things.

19:20 For behold, I have workings in the spirit, <152 doth weary me
even that all my joints are weak, for <289 who are at Jerusalem; for
had not the Lord been merciful, to show unto me <492 them, even
as he had prophets of old, I <57 have perished also.

19:21 And he <385 did show unto the <19 of old all <116
<32 them; and also he did show unto many <9 us;
wherefore, it must needs be that we know <11 them for they are
<146 upon the plates of brass.

19:22 Now it came to pass that I, <165 did teach my brethren <124
things; and it came to pass that I did read many <63 to <94 <126
were engraven upon the <41 of brass, that they <185 know <57
the doings of the Lord in other lands, <339 <220 of old.

19:23 And I did read many <39 unto them <39 were <79 in the
books of Moses; but that I <40 more fully <227 them to believe in
the Lord <227 Redeemer I did read unto them that <31 was <31 by
the <307 Isaiah; for I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it
<38 be for our profit and learning.

19:24 Wherefore I spake unto <105 saying: Hear ye the <343 of the
<414 ye who are a remnant of the <273 of <273 a branch who have
been broken off; hear ye the <26 of the <25 <69 were <69
unto all the <25 of <25 and <69 them unto yourselves, that ye
may have hope as well as your <181 from whom ye have been <40
off; for after this manner has the <103 written.

1 Nephi Chapter 20

20:1 Hearken and hear this, O <51 of Jacob, who are called by the
name of <60 and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, or out
of the <8 of baptism, who swear by the name of the <440 and make
mention of the God of <35 yet they <18 not in truth nor in
righteousness.

20:2 Nevertheless, they call themselves of the holy city, but they do
not stay <11 upon the God of <34 who is the Lord of Hosts;
yea, the Lord of Hosts is his name.

20:3 Behold, I have declared the former <267 from the beginning; and
they went <99 out of my mouth, and I showed them. I did show them
suddenly.

20:4 And I did it because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck
is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;

20:5 And I have even from the beginning <64 to thee; before it
came to pass I <56 them <10 and I <5 them for fear lest thou
shouldst say—mine idol hath done <287 and my graven image, and my
molten image hath commanded <84

20:6 Thou hast seen and heard all this; and will ye not declare them?
And that I have <47 thee new <126 from this time, even hidden
things, and thou didst not know <39

20:7 They are created now, and not from the beginning, even <90 the
day when thou heardest them not they were <104 unto thee, lest thou
<88 say—Behold I knew <36

20:8 Yea, and thou <23 not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that
time thine ear was not opened; for I knew that thou wouldst deal very
treacherously, and wast <312 a transgressor from the womb.

20:9 <266 for my name’s sake will I defer mine anger, and for
my praise will I refrain from <73 that I cut thee not off.

20:10 For, behold, I have refined <16 I have chosen thee in the
furnace of affliction.

20:11 For mine own sake, yea, for mine own sake will I do <391 for I
will not suffer my name to be polluted, and I will not give my glory
unto another.

20:12 <420 unto me, O <417 and Israel my called, for I am he; I am
the first, and I am also the last.

20:13 Mine hand hath also laid the foundation of the earth, and my
right hand hath spanned the heavens. I call unto them and they stand up
together.

20:14 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; who among them hath
<216 these <257 unto <268 The Lord hath loved him; yea, and he
will fulfill his word which he hath <21 by them; and he will do
his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall come upon the Chaldeans.

20:15 Also, saith the Lord; I the <501 yea, I have spoken; yea, I have
<230 him to declare, I have brought him, and he <34 make his way
prosperous.

20:16 Come ye near unto me; I have not spoken in secret; from the
<323 from the time that it was <80 have I <49 and the
Lord God, and his Spirit, hath sent me.

20:17 And thus <76 the <73 thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I
have sent him, the Lord thy God who teacheth thee to profit, who
leadeth thee by the way thou <364 go, hath done it.

20:18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments—then had thy peace
been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea.

20:19 Thy seed also had been as the sand; the offspring of thy bowels
like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor
destroyed from <449 me.

20:20 Go ye forth of <200 flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice
of singing <509 ye, tell <345 utter to the end of the earth; say
ye: The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob.

20:21 And they thirsted not; he led them through the deserts; he caused
the waters to flow out of the rock for <268 he clave the rock also and
the <17 gushed out.

20:22 And notwithstanding he hath done all <66 and greater also,
there is no peace, <200 the <200 unto the wicked.

1 Nephi Chapter 21

21:1 And again: Hearken, O ye house of Israel, all ye that are broken
off and are driven out because of the wickedness of the pastors of my
people; yea, all ye that are <23 off, that are scattered abroad, who
are of my people, O <43 of Israel. Listen, O isles, unto me, and
hearken ye people from far; the Lord hath <345 me from the womb; from
the <209 of my mother hath he made mention of my name.

21:2 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his
hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath
he hid me;

21:3 And said unto me: Thou art my servant, O <130 in whom I will be
glorified.

21:4 Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for
naught and in vain; surely my judgment is with the <189 and my work
with my God.

21:5 And now, <205 the Lord—that formed me from the womb that I <325
be his <67 to bring Jacob again to him—though Israel be not
gathered, yet <484 I be glorious in the eyes of the <50 and my God
<14 be my strength.

21:6 And he said: It is a light thing that thou <432 be my <326
to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of
<216 I will also give thee for a <31 to the Gentiles, that thou
mayest be my salvation unto the ends of the earth.

21:7 Thus <108 the <74 the Redeemer of <165 his Holy One, to him
whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to <69 of
rulers: Kings <95 see and arise, princes also <6 worship, <313
of the Lord that is faithful.

21:8 Thus <49 the Lord: In an acceptable time have I heard thee, O
isles of the sea, and in a day of <83 have I helped thee; and I
will preserve <22 and give thee my <63 for a covenant of the
<343 to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate
heritages;

21:9 That thou <127 say to the prisoners: Go forth; to them that sit
in darkness: Show yourselves. They <95 feed in the ways, and their
pastures <9 be in all high places.

21:10 They <11 not hunger nor thirst, neither <6 the heat nor the
sun smite <507 for he that hath mercy on them <16 lead them, even by
the springs of water <10 he guide them.

21:11 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways <20 be
exalted.

21:12 And then, O <460 of <208 behold, these <16 come from far;
and lo, <8 from the north and from the west; and <9 from the land
of Sinim.

21:13 Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; for the feet of those
who are in the east <46 be established; and break forth into singing,
O mountains; for they <13 be smitten no more; for the Lord hath
comforted his <195 and will have <124 upon his afflicted.

21:14 But, <86 Zion hath <361 The Lord hath forsaken me, and my
Lord hath forgotten me—but he will show that he hath not.

21:15 For can a woman forget her sucking child, that she <436 not
have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will
I not <26 <278 O <149 of <393

21:16 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls
are continually before me.

21:17 Thy children <116 make haste against thy destroyers; and they
that made thee waste <13 go <139 of thee.

21:18 Lift up thine eyes round about and behold; all <190 gather
themselves together, and they <25 come to <24 And as I live, <389
the <439 thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an
ornament, and bind them on even as a bride.

21:19 For thy <65 and thy <369 places, and the land of thy
destruction, <51 even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants;
and they that swallowed thee up <18 be far away.

21:20 The <117 whom thou <68 have, after thou hast lost the
first, <21 again in <107 ears say: The place is too strait for me;
give <8 to me that I may dwell.

21:21 Then <36 thou say in <28 heart: Who hath begotten me these,
seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and
removing to and fro? And who hath brought up these? <214 I was left
alone; <31 where have they been?

21:22 Thus <160 the Lord God: <20 I will lift up mine hand to the
Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people; and they <103 bring
thy sons in <494 arms, and thy daughters <11 be carried upon <9
shoulders.

21:23 And kings <13 be thy nursing fathers, and <15 queens thy
<7 mothers; they <13 bow down to thee with <13 face towards
the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou <135 know that I
am the Lord; for they <32 not be ashamed that wait for me.

21:24 For <13 the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful
captives delivered?

21:25 But thus <127 the <286 even the <13 of the mighty <29 be
<28 away, and the prey of the terrible <11 be delivered; for I will
contend with him that contendeth with <399 and I will save thy
children.

21:26 And I will feed them that oppress thee with <113 own flesh; they
<39 be drunken with <9 own blood as with sweet wine; and all flesh
<15 know that I, the <77 am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the Mighty
One of Jacob.

1 Nephi Chapter 22

22:1 And now it came to pass that <322 I, Nephi, had read <417 things
which were engraven upon the plates of brass, my brethren came unto me
and said unto me: What meaneth <23 <23 <22 ye have read? <267
are they to be understood according to <14 <14 are spiritual,
<4 <85 come to pass <12 to the spirit and not the flesh?

22:2 And I, <65 said unto them: Behold they were manifest unto the
prophet by the voice of the Spirit; for by the Spirit are all <48
made known unto the prophets, <50 <50 come upon the <430 of men
<54 to the flesh.

22:3 Wherefore, the <26 of <21 I have read are <7 pertaining
to <4 both temporal and spiritual; for it appears that the house of
Israel, sooner or later, will be scattered upon all the face of the
<319 and also among all nations.

22:4 And behold, there are many who are already lost from the knowledge
of those who are at Jerusalem. Yea, the more part of all the tribes
have been led away; and they are <53 to and fro upon the isles of
the sea; and whither they are none of us knoweth, save that we know
that they have been led away.

22:5 And since they have been led <337 <213 <114 have been
prophesied concerning them, and also <4 all <74 who <156
hereafter be <59 and be confounded, because of the Holy One of
Israel; for against him will they harden <324 hearts; wherefore, they
<27 be <25 <127 all nations and <7 be hated of all men.

22:6 Nevertheless, <300 they <13 be nursed by the Gentiles, and the
Lord has lifted up his hand upon the Gentiles and set them up for a
standard, and <52 <227 have been carried in <6 arms, and <3
daughters have been <10 upon <7 shoulders, behold <107 <107
of <233 are spoken are temporal; for thus are the covenants of the
Lord with our fathers; and it <344 us in the days to come, and also
all our <366 who are of the <250 of Israel.

22:7 And it <26 that the time cometh that <103 all the <18 of
Israel have been <128 and <152 that the Lord God will raise
up a mighty nation <141 the <121 yea, even upon the face of this
land; and by them <139 our seed be scattered.

22:8 And <48 our seed is <43 the Lord God will proceed to do a
marvelous work <41 the <41 <118 <30 be of great worth unto
our seed; <201 it is likened unto <140 being nourished by the
<172 and <7 <151 in <11 arms and upon <4 shoulders.

22:9 And it <37 also be of <37 unto the Gentiles; and not only unto
the <31 but unto all the <121 of <388 unto the making <439 of
the <176 of the Father of heaven unto Abraham, saying: In thy seed
<42 all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.

22:10 And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the
<23 of the <23 cannot be blessed unless he <35 make bare his
arm in the eyes of the <436

22:11 <486 the Lord God will <146 to make bare his arm in the
eyes of all the nations, in bringing about his <87 and his gospel
unto <377 who are of the <108 of <247

22:12 <41 he will bring them again out of captivity, and they
<69 be gathered together to the lands of <162 inheritance; and they
<13 be brought out of obscurity and out of darkness; and they <12
know that the Lord is <24 Savior and <3 Redeemer, the Mighty One
of <59

22:13 And the blood of that <232 and abominable church, <240 is the
whore of all the earth, <40 turn upon <33 own heads; for they <8
war <263 themselves, and the sword of <14 own hands <12 fall upon
<7 own heads, and they <9 be drunken with <9 own blood.

22:14 And every <336 <52 <15 war <493 thee, O <133 of <241
<9 be turned one <11 another, and they <8 fall into the pit
<24 they digged to ensnare the people of the Lord. And all that fight
<25 Zion <23 be destroyed, and that <102 whore, who hath
perverted the right ways of the Lord, yea, that <14 and <116
<117 <24 tumble to the dust and <11 <7 be the fall of it.

22:15 For behold, saith the prophet, the time <450 speedily that
Satan <22 have no more power over the hearts of the children of men;
for the day soon <23 that all the proud and they who do wickedly
<29 be as stubble; and the day <18 that they must be burned.

22:16 For the time soon <14 that the fulness of the wrath of God
<31 be poured out upon all the <57 of men; for he will not
suffer that the wicked <19 destroy the righteous.

22:17 <301 he will preserve the righteous by his power, even if
it so be that the <51 of his <51 must come, and the <20 be
preserved, even unto the destruction of <225 enemies by fire.
<39 the <16 need not fear; for thus <144 the <144
they <60 be saved, even if it so be as by <25

22:18 Behold, my <445 I say unto you, that these things must
shortly come; yea, even blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke must <11
and it must needs be upon the face of this earth; and it <143 unto
men according to the flesh if it so be that they will harden <88
<204 <267 the Holy One of <377

22:19 For <234 the <97 <87 not perish; for the time surely
must come that all they who <297 <29 Zion <17 be cut off.

22:20 And the Lord will <23 prepare a way for his people, unto the
fulfilling of the words of Moses, <341 he spake, saying: A prophet
<35 the Lord your God raise up unto you, like unto me; him <13 ye
hear in all <134 whatsoever he <9 say unto you. And it <6 come
to pass that all those who will not hear that <43 <14 be cut off
from <452 the people.

22:21 And now I, Nephi, declare unto you, that this <23 of whom
Moses spake was the Holy One of Israel; wherefore, he <36 execute
judgment in righteousness.

22:22 And the <143 need not fear, for they are <62 who <21 not
be confounded. But it is the kingdom of the devil, <119 <14 be built
up <70 the <331 of men, <11 <16 is established <9 them
<7 are in the flesh—

22:23 For the time <424 <30 come that all churches <18 are
<36 up to get gain, and all <61 who are <10 up to get <439 over
the flesh, and <13 who are <13 up to become popular in the eyes of
the world, and <16 who seek the lusts of the <272 and the <178 of
the <16 and to do all manner of iniquity; yea, in fine, all <26
who belong to the <95 of the devil are they who need <134 and
tremble, and quake; they are <22 who must be brought low in the dust;
they are <12 who must be consumed as <499 and this is <338
to the <271 of the prophet.

22:24 And the time <357 <131 that the <186 must be led up as
calves of the stall, and the Holy One of Israel must reign in dominion,
and might, and <484 and great glory.

22:25 And he gathereth his <193 from the four quarters of the
<409 and he numbereth his sheep, and they know him; and there <190
be one fold and one shepherd; and he <10 feed his <20 and in him
they <9 find pasture.

22:26 And because of the righteousness of his <383 Satan has no
power; <296 he cannot be loosed for the space of many years; for
he hath no <223 over the <458 of the <28 for they dwell in
righteousness, and the Holy One of <114 reigneth.

22:27 And now <469 I, <358 say unto you that all these <226 must
come <170 to the flesh.

22:28 But, <22 all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people <91
<48 safely in the Holy One of <46 if it so be that they will
repent.

22:29 And now I, <53 make an end; for I durst not speak further as
yet concerning <61 things.

22:30 Wherefore, my brethren, I would that ye should consider that the
<78 <354 have been written upon the plates of brass are true; and
they testify that a man must be obedient to the commandments of God.

22:31 <43 ye need not suppose that I and my father are the only
ones that have testified, and also taught them. <22 if ye <114
be <38 to the commandments, and endure to the end, ye <13 be
saved at the last day. And thus it is. Amen.




 THE SECOND BOOK OF NEPHI


An account of the death of Lehi. Nephi’s brethren rebel against him.
The Lord warns Nephi to depart into the wilderness. His journeyings in
the wilderness, and so forth.

2 <19 Chapter 1

1:1 And now it came to pass that after I, <185 had made an end of
teaching my <172 our father, Lehi, also spake many <169 unto
them, and rehearsed unto <4 how <376 <10 the Lord had done for
them in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem.

1:2 And he <35 unto them <224 their rebellions upon the waters,
and the mercies of God in sparing <13 lives, that they were not
swallowed up in the sea.

1:3 And he also <36 unto them <36 the land of promise, <245
they had obtained—how merciful the Lord had been in warning us that we
<267 flee out of the land of <74

1:4 For, <340 said he, I have seen a vision, in <38 I know that
Jerusalem is destroyed; and had we remained in <8 we <37 also
have perished.

1:5 But, said he, notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a
land of <76 a land <40 is choice above all other lands; a land
<10 the Lord God hath covenanted with me <43 be a land for the
inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath <18 this land unto
me, and to my children forever, and also all those who <31 be led
out of <50 countries by the hand of the Lord.

1:6 <338 I, <228 prophesy <469 to the workings of the
Spirit <69 is in me, that there <340 none come into this land save
they <9 be brought by the hand of the <40

1:7 <40 this land is consecrated unto him whom he <22 bring.
And if it so be that they <10 serve him <58 to the <432
<55 he hath given, it <13 be a land of liberty unto them;
wherefore, they <11 never be <57 down into captivity; if so, it
<11 be because of iniquity; for if iniquity <8 abound cursed <3
be the land for <283 sakes, but unto the righteous it <13 be blessed
forever.

1:8 And <244 it is wisdom that this land <153 be kept as yet from
the knowledge of <157 nations; for <20 many nations would overrun
the land, that <140 <7 be no place for an inheritance.

1:9 <129 I, <169 have <248 a <245 that inasmuch as <199
whom the Lord God <67 bring out of the land of <286 <8 keep
his commandments, they <6 prosper upon the face of this land; and
they <11 be kept from all <70 nations, that they may possess this
land unto themselves. And if it so be that they <23 keep his
<172 they <6 be <121 upon the face of this <92 and
<93 <12 be none to molest <471 nor to take away the land of <153
inheritance; and they <18 dwell safely <150

1:10 But <130 when the time cometh that they <16 dwindle in
unbelief, after they have received so <508 blessings from the hand of
the Lord—having a <162 of the creation of the earth, and all men,
knowing the <23 and marvelous works of the Lord from the <19 of
the world; having power given them to do all things by faith; <10
all the <109 from the beginning, and <9 been <267 by his
infinite goodness into this precious land of promise—behold, I say, if
the day <86 come that they will reject the Holy One of Israel, the
true Messiah, <122 Redeemer and <3 God, <113 the judgments of
him that is just <29 rest upon them.

1:11 Yea, he will <225 <197 <263 unto <159 and he will give unto
them power, and he will take away from them the lands of <45
possessions, and he will cause them to be scattered and smitten.

1:12 Yea, as one generation passeth to another <208 <59 be
bloodsheds, and <146 visitations among <388 <387 my sons, I
<315 that ye <3 remember; yea, I <4 that ye <3 hearken unto
my words.

1:13 O that ye <13 awake; awake from a deep sleep, yea, even from the
sleep of hell, and shake off the awful chains by <451 ye are bound,
<5 are the <10 <4 bind the children of men, that they are
carried away captive down to the eternal gulf of misery and woe.

1:14 Awake! and arise from the dust, and hear the words of a trembling
parent, whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent grave,
from whence no traveler can return; a few more days and I go the way of
all the earth.

1:15 But <216 the Lord hath redeemed my soul from hell; I have
beheld his glory, and I am encircled about eternally in the arms of his
love.

1:16 And I desire that ye <509 remember to observe the statutes and
the <260 of the Lord; <50 this hath been the anxiety of my
soul from the beginning.

1:17 My heart hath been weighed down with sorrow from time to time, for
I have feared, lest for the hardness of your hearts the Lord your God
<59 come out in the fulness of his wrath upon you, that ye be cut
off and destroyed forever;

1:18 Or, that a cursing <28 come upon you for the space of many
generations; and ye are visited by sword, and by famine, and are hated,
and are led according to the will and captivity of the devil.

1:19 O my <303 that these <437 might not come upon you, but that ye
<9 be a choice and a favored people of the Lord. But <141 his
will be done; for his ways are righteousness forever.

1:20 And he hath said that: Inasmuch as ye <363 keep my <479
ye <6 prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my
<17 ye <16 be cut off from my presence.

1:21 And now that my soul <74 have joy in you, and that my <193
<10 leave this world with gladness because of you, that I <11 not
be brought down with grief and <209 to the <313 <339 from the
<340 my <127 and be men, and be determined in one mind and in one
heart, united in all things, that ye may not come down into captivity;

1:22 That ye may not be cursed with a sore cursing; and also, that ye
may not incur the displeasure of a just God upon you, unto the
destruction, yea, the <420 destruction of both soul and body.

1:23 Awake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off the
<461 with <462 ye are <471 and come forth out of obscurity, and
<107 from the dust.

1:24 Rebel no more against your brother, <447 views have been
glorious, and who hath kept the <184 from the time that we left
Jerusalem; and who hath been an instrument in the hands of God, in
bringing us <55 into the land of promise; for were it not for him, we
must have perished with hunger in the wilderness; nevertheless, ye
sought to take away his life; yea, and he hath suffered much <197
<213 of you.

1:25 And I exceedingly fear and tremble <13 of you, lest he <263
suffer again; for <314 ye have accused him that he <44 power and
authority over you; but I know that he hath not <14 for <15 nor
<15 over you, but he hath <11 the glory of God, and your own
<190 welfare.

1:26 And ye have murmured <61 he hath been plain unto you. Ye say
that he hath used sharpness; ye say that he hath been angry with you;
but <77 his sharpness was the <3 of the <62 of the word of
God, <215 was in him; and that <6 ye call anger was the truth,
<460 to that <11 is in God, <4 he could not restrain,
manifesting boldly concerning your iniquities.

1:27 And it must needs be that the <50 of God must be with him, even
unto his commanding you that ye must obey. But <76 it was not he,
but it was the Spirit of the Lord <54 was in him, <4 opened his
mouth to utterance that he <65 not shut it.

1:28 And now my son, Laman, and also Lemuel and Sam, and also my sons
who are the sons of Ishmael, <56 if ye will hearken unto the voice
of Nephi ye <226 not perish. And if ye will <15 unto him I <473
unto you a blessing, yea, even my first blessing.

1:29 But if ye will not <24 unto him I take away my <18 <23
yea, even my <5 and it <47 rest upon him.

1:30 And now Zoram, I speak unto you: Behold, thou art the servant of
Laban; <331 thou hast been brought out of the land of
Jerusalem, and I know that thou art a true friend unto my son, Nephi,
forever.

1:31 Wherefore, <272 thou hast been faithful thy seed <62 be
blessed with his seed, that they dwell in prosperity long upon the face
of this land; and nothing, save it <24 be iniquity among them, <5
harm or disturb their <24 upon the face of this land <55

1:32 <55 if ye <21 keep the <469 of the Lord, the Lord
hath consecrated this land for the security of thy seed with the seed
of my son.

2 <192 Chapter 2

2:1 And now, Jacob, I <142 unto you: Thou art my first-born in the
days of my tribulation in the wilderness. And <231 in thy childhood
thou hast <474 afflictions and much sorrow, <129 of the rudeness
of thy brethren.

2:2 Nevertheless, <45 my <39 in the wilderness, thou knowest
the greatness of God; and he <100 consecrate thine <35 for thy
gain.

2:3 <115 thy soul <15 be blessed, and thou shalt <162 safely
with thy brother, Nephi; and thy days <16 be spent in the service of
thy God. <29 I know that thou art redeemed, <76 of the
righteousness of thy Redeemer; for thou hast beheld that in the fulness
of time he cometh to bring salvation unto men.

2:4 And thou hast <22 in thy youth his glory; wherefore, thou art
<238 even as they unto whom he <67 minister in the flesh; for the
<423 is the same, yesterday, today, and <221 And the way is
prepared from the fall of man, and <55 is free.

2:5 And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil.
And the law is given unto men. And by the law no flesh is justified;
or, by the law men are cut off. Yea, by the temporal law they were cut
off; and also, by the spiritual law they perish from that <498 is
good, and become miserable <83

2:6 <160 redemption <135 in and through the Holy Messiah; for
he is full of grace and truth.

2:7 <420 he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends
of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite
spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.

2:8 <67 how great the importance to make these things known unto
the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is no <136
that can <276 in the presence of God, save it be <100 the merits,
and mercy, and <97 of the Holy Messiah, who layeth down his life
according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit,
that he may <272 to pass the resurrection of the dead, being the first
that should rise.

2:9 <93 he is the first-fruits unto God, inasmuch as he <273
make intercession for all the children of men; and they that believe in
him <17 be saved.

2:10 And <348 of the <25 for all, all men come unto God;
<321 they stand in the <113 of him to be judged of him
<98 to the truth and holiness <239 is in him. <71 the
ends of the law <11 the Holy One hath given, unto the inflicting of
the punishment <13 is affixed, <3 <5 that is affixed is in
opposition to that of the happiness <14 is <17 to <241 the
ends of the atonement—

2:11 For it must needs be, that <200 is an <30 in all things.
If not so, my first-born in the wilderness, <454 could not be
brought to pass, neither wickedness, <2 <90 nor misery,
<5 good nor bad. <93 all <251 must <42 be a compound in
one; <128 if it <184 be one body it must <16 remain as <199
having no life <32 death, nor corruption nor incorruption,
<92 nor <43 <10 sense nor insensibility.

2:12 <46 it must <29 have been created for a thing of naught;
wherefore <95 would have been no purpose in the end of its creation.
<27 this <20 must <28 destroy the wisdom of God and his
eternal purposes, and also the power, and the <308 and the justice of
God.

2:13 And if ye <245 say <50 is no law, ye <7 also say <8 is no
sin. If ye <10 say <9 is no sin, ye <7 also say <8 is no
righteousness. And if <7 be no <164 <4 be no happiness.
And if <7 be no <11 nor <123 <6 be no <231
nor misery. And if <418 <167 are not <13 is no God. And if <6
is no God we are not, <148 the earth; for <12 <209 have been no
creation of things, <13 to act nor to be acted upon; <196 all
<41 must have vanished away.

2:14 And now, my sons, I speak unto you <59 <18 for your profit
and learning; for <46 is a God, and he hath <191 all <47 both
the heavens and the <493 and all <27 that in them are, both <6
to act and <5 to be <64 upon.

2:15 And to <460 about his <194 purposes in the end of man, after
he had <48 our <466 parents, and the beasts of the field and the
fowls of the air, and in fine, all <46 <369 are created, it must
<242 be that <86 was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in
<364 to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other
bitter.

2:16 <278 the Lord God gave unto man that he <346 act for
himself. <14 man <176 not act for himself save it <14 be
that he was enticed by the one or the other.

2:17 And I, Lehi, <497 to the <85 <85 I have read, must <84
suppose that an angel of God, <17 to that <16 is written, had
fallen from heaven; <215 he became a devil, <402 sought that
<17 was evil before God.

2:18 And because he had <25 from heaven, and had become miserable
forever, he <26 also the misery of all mankind. <96 he said
unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent, who is the <49 who is the
father of all lies, <425 he said: Partake of the <162 fruit,
and ye <363 not die, but ye <5 be as God, knowing good and evil.

2:19 And <226 Adam and Eve had partaken of the <31 <193 they
were driven out of the garden of Eden, to till the earth.

2:20 And they have brought forth children; yea, even the family of all
the <19

2:21 And the days of the children of men were prolonged, <159 to
the will of God, that they might repent while in the flesh; <163
their state <165 a <3 of probation, and <8 time was lengthened,
<30 to the commandments <173 the Lord God gave unto the <46
of men. For he gave commandment that all men must repent; for he showed
unto all men that they were lost, <194 of the transgression of <45
parents.

2:22 And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have
fallen, but he <7 have remained in the <138 of Eden. And all
<277 <71 were <386 must have <15 in the same <93 in <11
they were <177 they were created; and they must have <18 <247
and had no end.

2:23 And they <48 have had no <169 <232 they <7 have
<23 in a <40 of innocence, <300 no joy, for they knew no
misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.

2:24 But <100 all <77 have been done in the wisdom of him who
knoweth all things.

2:25 Adam fell that men <194 be; and men are, that they <7 have
joy.

2:26 And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem
the <192 of men from the fall. And <175 that they are redeemed
from the fall they have <372 free <124 <320 good from evil; to
act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the
punishment of the law at the great and last day, <255 to the
<256 <174 God hath given.

2:27 <407 men are free <17 to the <291 and all <127 are
given them <23 are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose
liberty and eternal life, through the <50 Mediator of all men, or to
<16 captivity and death, <41 to the <6 and power of the
devil; for he seeketh that all men <149 be <481 like unto
himself.

2:28 And now, my sons, I <227 that ye should look to the <51
Mediator, and hearken unto his <7 commandments; and be faithful unto
his words, and <60 <73 <73 <59 to the will of his Holy
Spirit;

2:29 And not <18 <18 <77 <18 to the will of the flesh
and the evil <118 is therein, <3 giveth the spirit of the devil
<94 to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign over
you in his own kingdom.

2:30 I have spoken these few words unto you all, my <103 in the last
days of my probation; and I have chosen the good part, <72 to the
<25 of the prophet. And I have none other object save it be the
everlasting welfare of your souls. Amen.

2 Nephi Chapter 3

3:1 And now I speak unto you, Joseph, my last-born. Thou wast born in
the wilderness of mine afflictions; yea, in the days of my greatest
sorrow did thy mother bear thee.

3:2 And may the Lord consecrate also unto thee this land, <141 is a
most precious <7 for thine inheritance and the <3 of thy
seed with thy brethren, for thy security <345 if it so be that ye
shall keep the <320 of the Holy One of Israel.

3:3 And now, <88 my last-born, whom I have brought out of the
<90 of mine afflictions, may the Lord bless thee <44 for
thy seed <41 not utterly be destroyed.

3:4 For <478 thou art the fruit of my loins; and I am a descendant
of Joseph who was carried captive into Egypt. And <291 were the
covenants of the Lord <113 he made unto Joseph.

3:5 <399 <26 truly saw our day. And he obtained a promise of
the Lord, that out of the <55 of his loins the Lord God <348 raise
up a righteous branch unto the house of Israel; not the Messiah, but a
<12 <54 was to be broken off, nevertheless, to be remembered in
the <71 of the Lord that the Messiah <384 be made manifest unto
them in the latter days, in the <338 of power, unto the bringing of
them out of darkness unto light—yea, out of hidden <6 and out of
<451 unto freedom.

3:6 For <107 <107 testified, saying: A seer <164 the Lord my God
<93 up, who <9 be a choice seer unto the <111 of my loins.

3:7 Yea, <31 <31 said: Thus saith the Lord unto me: A <23 seer
will I <34 up out of the <29 of thy <195 and he <42 be esteemed
highly among the <13 of thy <42 And unto him will I give
commandment that he <21 do a work for the <20 of thy loins, his
<301 <154 <14 be of <220 worth unto them, even to the <127
of them to the knowledge of the <161 <21 I have made with thy
fathers.

3:8 And I will give unto him a <56 that he <42 do none <438
work, save the work <31 I <11 command him. And I will make him
<59 in mine eyes; for he <15 do my work.

3:9 And he <10 be <18 like unto Moses, whom I have said I <263
<137 up unto you, to deliver my people, O <265 of <384

3:10 And Moses will I <20 up, to <18 thy people out of the land
of <342

3:11 But a seer will I <22 up out of the <146 of thy <179 and unto
him will I give power to bring forth my word unto the seed of thy
loins—and not to the <155 <14 my word only, <227 the <358 but
to the convincing them of my word, <131 <105 have already gone <21
<219 them.

3:12 <395 the <59 of thy <378 <18 write; and the <8 of
the <9 of Judah <11 <11 and that <34 <5 be written by the
<18 of thy <231 and also that <14 <14 be <14 by the <13
of the <31 of Judah, <12 grow together, unto the confounding of
false doctrines and laying down of contentions, and establishing peace
<73 the <28 of thy <41 and <104 them to the <257 of
their fathers in the <406 <406 and also to the <13 of my
covenants, <121 the Lord.

3:13 And out of weakness he <60 be made strong, in that day when my
work <11 commence <54 all my <221 unto the restoring thee, O
<226 of Israel, <38 the <38

3:14 And thus prophesied Joseph, <429 Behold, that seer will the
Lord bless; and they that seek to destroy him <42 be confounded; for
this promise, <133 I have obtained of the <197 of the <108 of my
<109 <21 be fulfilled. <39 I am sure of the fulfilling of this
promise;

3:15 And his name <21 be called after me; and it <7 be <6 the
name of his father. And he <11 be like unto me; for the thing, <61
the Lord <12 <278 <243 by his hand, by the <287 of the Lord <12
<13 my <328 unto salvation.

3:16 Yea, thus <115 Joseph: I am sure of this <37 even as I am
sure of the promise of Moses; for the Lord hath said unto me, I will
preserve thy seed forever.

3:17 And the Lord hath said: I will <364 up a <29 and I will give
<70 unto him in a rod; and I will give judgment unto him in writing.
Yet I will not loose his tongue, that he <91 speak much, for I will
not make him mighty in speaking. But I will write unto him my law, by
the finger of mine own hand; and I will make a spokesman for him.

3:18 And the Lord said unto me also: I will <84 up unto the <213 of
thy <448 and I will make for him a spokesman. And I, behold, I will
give unto him that he <78 <63 the writing of the <30 of thy
<243 unto the <7 of thy <36 and the <63 of thy <391
<24 declare it.

3:19 And the words <219 he <12 <36 <2 be the <8 <8 are
expedient in my wisdom should go <230 unto the <41 of thy loins. And
it <23 be as if the <12 of thy <47 had cried unto them from the
dust; for I know <414 faith.

3:20 And they <28 cry from the <16 yea, even repentance unto <17
brethren, even <304 many generations have gone by them. And it <22
come to pass that <19 cry <8 go, even according to the simpleness
of <11 words.

3:21 Because of <8 faith <2 <98 <21 proceed <91 out of my
mouth unto <11 brethren who are the <88 of thy <141 and the
<469 of <14 <25 will I make strong in <7 faith, unto the
remembering of my covenant <137 I made unto thy fathers.

3:22 And now, <200 my son <464 <93 this manner did my father of
old prophesy.

3:23 Wherefore, because of this <35 thou art blessed; for thy seed
<81 not be destroyed, for they <6 hearken unto the <67 of the
book.

3:24 And there <15 rise up one <314 among them, who <8 do much
good, both in word and in deed, being an instrument in the hands of
God, with exceeding <101 to work <29 wonders, and do that thing
<103 is great in the sight of God, unto the bringing to pass much
restoration unto the house of Israel, and unto the seed of thy
brethren.

3:25 And now, blessed art thou, Joseph. Behold, thou art little;
wherefore <99 unto the <99 of thy brother, Nephi, and it <87 be
done unto thee even <222 to the <17 <66 I have spoken.
Remember the <8 of thy dying father. Amen.

2 Nephi Chapter 4

4:1 And now, I, <41 <453 concerning the prophecies of <33 my
<184 hath spoken, <10 <194 who was carried into Egypt.

4:2 For <208 he truly prophesied <16 all his seed. And the
<31 <30 he wrote, <173 are not many greater. And he
<20 <20 us, and our future generations; and they are
written upon the plates of brass.

4:3 <234 <249 my <62 had made an end of speaking <30
the <46 of <70 he called the children of Laman, his sons,
and his daughters, and said unto them: <154 my <11 and my
<11 who are the sons and the daughters of my first-born, I would
that ye <448 give ear unto my <373

4:4 For the Lord God hath said that: Inasmuch as ye <180 keep my
commandments ye <6 prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not
keep my <16 ye <16 be cut off from my presence.

4:5 But <152 my sons and my <75 I cannot go down to my grave
save I <70 leave a blessing upon you; for <23 I know that if ye
are brought up in the way ye <21 go ye will not depart from it.

4:6 <157 if ye are cursed, <31 I <39 my <39 upon you,
that the cursing may be taken from you and be answered upon the heads
of your parents.

4:7 <35 <426 of my <30 the Lord God will not suffer that
ye <110 perish; wherefore, he will be merciful unto you and unto your
seed forever.

4:8 And it came to pass that <230 my <230 had made an end of
<231 to the sons and <200 of <226 he caused the sons and
<9 of Lemuel to be <120 before him.

4:9 And he spake unto <465 saying: <240 my sons and my <164
who are the sons and the <31 of my second son; behold I <128
unto you the same <102 <331 I left unto the sons and <21 of
Laman; <102 thou shalt not utterly be destroyed; but in the end
thy seed <118 be blessed.

4:10 And it came to pass that when my <106 had made an end of
<106 unto <78 <187 he <83 unto the sons of Ishmael, yea, and
even all his household.

4:11 And <138 he had made an end of <30 unto <30 he <29 unto
Sam, <113 Blessed art <511 and thy seed; for thou <69 inherit the
land like unto thy brother Nephi. And thy seed <13 be numbered with
his <22 and thou <103 be even like unto thy brother, and thy seed
like unto his <17 and thou <17 be blessed in all thy days.

4:12 And it came to pass <79 my father, Lehi, had spoken unto all his
household, according to the feelings of his heart and the Spirit of the
Lord <174 was in him, he waxed old. And it came to pass that he died,
and was buried.

4:13 And it came to pass that not many days <57 his death, Laman and
<255 and the sons of Ishmael were angry with me <328 of the
admonitions of the Lord.

4:14 For I, Nephi, was constrained to speak unto <163 <83 to his
word; for I had <97 many things unto <13 and also my <108
<300 his death; many of <92 sayings are written upon mine other
plates; for a more history part are <12 upon mine <12 plates.

4:15 And upon these I write the <43 of my soul, and many of the
scriptures <40 are engraven upon the plates of brass. For my soul
delighteth in the scriptures, and my <158 pondereth <71 and writeth
them for the learning and the profit of my children.

4:16 <371 my soul <29 in the <54 of the Lord; and my <32
<33 continually upon the <12 <57 I have seen and heard.

4:17 Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in
showing me his <10 and marvelous works, my <35 exclaimeth: O
wretched man that I am! Yea, my <11 sorroweth <182 of my flesh; my
soul grieveth <8 of mine iniquities.

4:18 I am encompassed about, <12 of the temptations and the sins
<69 do so easily beset me.

4:19 And when I desire to rejoice, my <47 groaneth <27 of my
sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.

4:20 My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine
afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters
of the <110 deep.

4:21 He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my
flesh.

4:22 He hath confounded mine enemies, unto the causing of them to quake
<273 me.

4:23 <196 he hath heard my cry by day, and he hath given me
knowledge by visions in the nighttime.

4:24 And by day have I <390 bold in mighty prayer <40 him; yea, my
voice have I sent up on high; and angels came down and ministered unto
me.

4:25 And upon the wings of his <436 hath my body been carried away
upon exceedingly high mountains. And mine eyes have beheld <126
things, yea, even too <6 for man; therefore I was bidden that I
should not <346 them.

4:26 O then, if I have seen so <25 <30 if the Lord in his
condescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so much
mercy, why <38 my <229 weep and my soul linger in the valley of
sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength slacken, <248 of
mine afflictions?

4:27 And why <34 I yield to sin, <16 of my flesh? Yea, why
<12 I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my
<59 to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry <35
of mine enemy?

4:28 Awake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and
give <41 no more for the enemy of my soul.

4:29 Do not anger again <41 of mine enemies. Do not slacken my
<103 <10 of mine afflictions.

4:30 <42 O my <42 and cry unto the <437 and say: O <4 I
will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God,
and the rock of my salvation.

4:31 O <28 wilt thou redeem my <109 Wilt thou deliver me out of the
hands of mine enemies? Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the
appearance of sin?

4:32 May the gates of hell be shut continually <319 me, <94 that
my <162 is broken and my spirit is contrite! O <59 wilt thou not
shut the <28 of thy righteousness <26 me, that I may walk in the
path of the low valley, that I may be strict in the plain road!

4:33 O <39 wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy
righteousness! O <14 wilt thou make a way for mine escape <51 mine
enemies! Wilt thou make my path straight <10 me! Wilt thou not <211
a stumbling block in my way—but that thou wouldst clear my way <19
me, and hedge not up my way, but the ways of mine enemy.

4:34 O <58 I have trusted in <190 and I will trust in thee forever.
I will not put my <10 in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is
he that putteth his <17 in the arm of flesh. Yea, <14 is he that
<14 his <14 in man or maketh <382 his arm.

4:35 Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea,
my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; <474 I will lift up my
voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto <96 my God, the rock of my
righteousness. Behold, my <19 shall forever ascend up unto <17 my
rock and mine everlasting God. Amen.

2 Nephi Chapter 5

5:1 <28 it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cry much unto the Lord
my God, <279 of the <388 of my brethren.

5:2 But behold, their <11 did increase against me, insomuch that they
did seek to take away my life.

5:3 Yea, they did murmur <21 me, saying: Our younger brother thinks
to rule over us; and we have had much trial <56 of him; wherefore,
now let us slay him, that we may not be afflicted more <17 of his
words. For <67 we will not have him to be our ruler; for it belongs
unto us, who are the elder brethren, to rule over this people.

5:4 Now I do not write upon these plates all the words which they
murmured <86 me. But it sufficeth me to say, that they did seek to
take away my <112

5:5 And it came to pass that the Lord did warn me, that I, <169
should depart from them and flee into the wilderness, and all those who
would go with me.

5:6 Wherefore, it came to pass that I, <31 did take my family, and
also Zoram and his <7 and Sam, mine <107 <163 and his <8
and Jacob and Joseph, my <174 <118 and also my sisters, and all
<53 who <52 go with me. And all <8 who <8 go with me were
<8 who believed in the warnings and the revelations of God;
<194 they did hearken unto my <182

5:7 And we did take our tents and whatsoever things were possible for
us, and did journey in the wilderness for the space of many days. And
after we had journeyed for the <12 of many days we did pitch our
tents.

5:8 And my people <80 that we <157 call the name of the place
Nephi; <74 we did call it Nephi.

5:9 And all <98 who were with me did take upon them to call
themselves the <39 of <23

5:10 And we did observe to keep the judgments, and the statutes, and
the commandments of the Lord in all <108 according to the law of
Moses.

5:11 And the Lord was with us; and we did prosper exceedingly; for we
did sow seed, and we did reap again in abundance. And we began to raise
flocks, and herds, and animals of every kind.

5:12 And I, <246 had also brought the records <322 were engraven
upon the <332 of brass; and also the ball, or compass, <15 was
prepared for my father by the hand of the Lord, <89 to that <16
is written.

5:13 And it came to pass that we <70 to <89 exceedingly, and to
multiply in the land.

5:14 And I, <69 did take the sword of Laban, and <221 the manner of
it did make many swords, lest by any means the <175 who were now
called Lamanites <217 come upon us and destroy us; for I knew their
hatred towards me and my children and <215 who were <24 my <455

5:15 And I did teach my <41 to build buildings, and to work in all
<64 of wood, and of iron, and of copper, and of brass, and of steel,
and of gold, and of silver, and of precious ores, <132 were in great
<195

5:16 And I, <112 did <48 a temple; and I did construct it <114 the
<51 of the temple of Solomon save it were not built of so many
<42 things; for they were not to be found upon the land,
<331 it could not be <23 like unto Solomon’s temple. But the
<41 of the construction was like unto the <46 of Solomon; and the
workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine.

5:17 And it came to pass that I, <84 did cause my <136 to be
industrious, and to labor with <169 hands.

5:18 And it came to pass that they <412 that I <195 be <18 king.
But I, <36 was desirous that they <12 have no king; nevertheless,
I did for them <282 to that <150 was in my power.

5:19 And behold, the words of the Lord had been fulfilled unto my
brethren, <23 he spake concerning them, that I <43 be <55 ruler
and <4 teacher. Wherefore, I had been <6 <10 and <3 teacher,
<51 to the <432 of the <340 until the time they sought
to take away my life.

5:20 <32 the word of the Lord was <59 <55 he <55 unto
me, saying that: Inasmuch as they will not hearken unto thy <82 they
shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And <98 they were
cut off from his presence.

5:21 And he had caused the cursing to come upon <103 yea, even a sore
cursing, because of <94 iniquity. For <34 they had hardened <7
hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; <256
as they were white, and <233 fair and delightsome, that they
might not be enticing unto my <229 the Lord God did <236 a skin of
blackness to come upon them.

5:22 And thus saith the Lord God: I will <22 that they <112 be
loathsome unto thy people, save they <9 repent of <75 iniquities.

5:23 And cursed <11 be the seed of him that mixeth with <17 seed;
for they <14 be <17 even with the same cursing. And the Lord <174
it, and it was done.

5:24 And <129 of <30 <143 <192 was upon them they did <122
an idle <65 full of mischief and subtlety, and did seek in the
wilderness for beasts of prey.

5:25 And the Lord God said unto me: They <66 be a scourge unto thy
seed, to stir them up in remembrance of me; and inasmuch as they will
not remember me, and <244 unto my words, they <31 <29 them
even unto destruction.

5:26 And it came to pass that I, <376 did consecrate Jacob and
Joseph, that they <337 be priests and teachers over the land of my
people.

5:27 And it came to pass that we lived after the <477 of happiness.

5:28 And thirty years had passed away from the time we left Jerusalem.

5:29 And I, <60 had kept the records upon my plates, <156 I had
made, of my <254 thus far.

5:30 And it came to pass that the Lord God said unto me: Make other
plates; and thou shalt engraven many things upon them <38 are good in
my sight, for the profit of thy <98

5:31 <411 I, <65 to be obedient to the <438 of the
<439 went and made these plates upon <36 I have <44 <7
things.

5:32 And I engraved that <15 is pleasing unto God. And if my <90
are pleased with the <68 of God they will be <9 with mine
engravings <25 are upon <39 plates.

5:33 And if my <29 desire to know the more particular part of the
history of my <14 they must search mine <118 <28

5:34 And it sufficeth me to say that forty <183 had <183 away, and
we had already had wars and contentions with our brethren.

2 Nephi Chapter 6

6:1 The words of Jacob, the brother of <136 <80 he <368 unto the
<60 of Nephi:

6:2 Behold, my beloved brethren, I, <23 having been called of God,
and ordained <256 the <256 of his holy order, and <16 been
consecrated by my <44 <43 unto whom ye look as a king or a
protector, and on whom ye depend for safety, behold ye know that I have
spoken unto you exceedingly many <187

6:3 Nevertheless, I speak unto you again; for I am desirous for the
welfare of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety is great for you; and ye
yourselves know that it ever has been. For I have exhorted you with all
diligence; and I have taught you the <134 of my father; and I have
<67 unto you concerning all <231 <141 are written, from the
creation of the world.

6:4 And now, behold, I would <80 unto you <25 <24 <24
are, and <4 are to come; wherefore, I will read you the <52 of
Isaiah. And they are the <8 <19 my <149 has desired that I
<449 <37 unto you. And I <5 unto you for your sakes, that ye may
learn and glorify the name of your God.

6:5 And now, the <40 <40 I <510 read are they <6 Isaiah <234
<75 all the house of Israel; <71 they may be likened unto
you, for ye are of the <16 of Israel. And there are many <100 <31
have been <134 by <36 <7 may be <27 unto you, because ye
are of the <27 of <27

6:6 And now <370 are the words: Thus saith the Lord God: <289 I
will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the
people; and they <94 bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters
<11 be carried upon <10 shoulders.

6:7 And kings <12 be thy nursing fathers, and <14 queens thy
<7 mothers; they <13 bow down to thee with <13 faces towards
the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I
am the Lord; for they <32 not be ashamed that wait for me.

6:8 And now I, <389 <249 <207 somewhat <173 <119 words. For
<259 the Lord has shown me that those who were at Jerusalem, from
whence we came, have been slain and <100 away captive.

6:9 <366 the Lord has <28 unto me that they <257 return
again. And he also has <13 unto me that the Lord God, the Holy One of
Israel, <21 manifest himself unto them in the flesh; and <456 he
<12 <12 <12 they <4 scourge him and crucify him,
according to the <273 of the angel who <269 it unto me.

6:10 And <31 they have hardened <152 hearts and stiffened <4
necks against the Holy One of <57 <470 the judgments of the Holy
One of Israel <149 come upon them. And the day cometh that they <10
be smitten and afflicted.

6:11 Wherefore, <48 they are driven to and fro, for thus <273 the
angel, many <25 be afflicted in the flesh, and <7 not be suffered
to perish, <312 of the prayers of the faithful; they <15 be
scattered, and smitten, and hated; nevertheless, the Lord will be
merciful unto them, that when they <20 come to the knowledge of <102
Redeemer, they <10 be gathered together again to the lands of <13
inheritance.

6:12 And blessed are the <336 they of whom the prophet has
written; for <242 if it so be that they <37 repent and fight not
<146 Zion, and do not unite themselves to that great and abominable
church, they <21 be saved; for the Lord God will fulfil his covenants
<426 he has made unto his children; and for this cause the <57 has
written <302 things.

6:13 <159 they that <55 <53 Zion and the covenant people of
the Lord <48 lick up the dust of <103 <362 and the <15 of the
Lord <15 not be ashamed. For the <11 of the Lord are they who wait
for him; for they still wait for the coming of the Messiah.

6:14 And <123 <285 to the <285 of the prophet, the Messiah
will set <306 <163 the second time to recover them; wherefore, he
will <319 <13 unto them in power and <133 glory, unto the
destruction of <80 enemies, when that day <277 when they <79
believe in him; and none will he destroy that <9 in him.

6:15 And they that <10 not in him <25 be destroyed, both by fire,
and by tempest, and by earthquakes, and by bloodsheds, and by
pestilence, and by famine. And they <25 know that the Lord is God,
the Holy One of Israel.

6:16 For <18 the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive
delivered?

6:17 But thus <345 the Lord: Even the captives of the mighty <29 be
<28 away, and the prey of the terrible <11 be delivered; for the
Mighty God <8 deliver his <219 people. For thus <35 the <35
I will contend with them that contendeth with thee—

6:18 And I will feed them that oppress thee, with <157 own <498 and
they <39 be drunken with <10 own blood as with sweet wine; and all
flesh <15 know that I the Lord am thy Savior and thy <383 the
<70 One of Jacob.

2 Nephi Chapter 7

7:1 Yea, for thus <79 the <79 Have I put thee <108 or have I cast
thee off forever? For thus <18 the <18 Where is the bill of your
mother’s divorcement? To whom have I put thee <29 or to <371 of my
creditors have I sold you? Yea, to whom have I sold you? Behold, for
your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is
your mother put away.

7:2 <388 when I came, there was no man; when I called, yea, <8
was none to answer. O house of Israel, is my hand shortened at all that
it cannot redeem, or have I no <334 to deliver? <63 at my rebuke I
dry up the sea, I make <173 rivers a wilderness and <5 fish to
stink because the waters are dried up, and they die <9 of thirst.

7:3 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth <31
covering.

7:4 The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should
know how to speak a word in season unto <252 O <102 of <341 When
ye are weary he waketh morning by morning. He <5 mine ear to hear
as the learned.

7:5 The Lord God hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,
neither turned away back.

7:6 I gave my back to the smiter, and my cheeks to them that plucked
off the hair. I hid not my face from shame and spitting.

7:7 For the Lord God will help me, therefore <318 I not be confounded.
Therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I <20 not
be ashamed.

7:8 And the Lord is near, and he justifieth me. Who will <399 with
me? Let us stand together. Who is mine adversary? Let him come near me,
and I will smite him with the strength of my mouth.

7:9 For the Lord God will help me. And all they who <64 condemn me,
behold, all they <7 wax old as a garment, and the moth <9 eat
them up.

7:10 Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of
his servant, that walketh in darkness and hath no light?

7:11 Behold all ye that kindle fire, that compass yourselves about with
sparks, walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks <408 ye have
kindled. This <67 ye have of mine hand—ye <6 lie down in sorrow.

2 <478 <478 8

8:1 Hearken unto me, ye that follow after righteousness. Look unto the
rock from whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit from <12 ye
are digged.

8:2 Look unto Abraham, your father, and unto Sarah, she that bare you;
for I called him alone, and blessed him.

8:3 For the Lord <79 comfort Zion, he will <4 all her waste
places; and he will make her <421 like Eden, and her desert like
the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness <32 be found therein,
thanksgiving and the <172 of melody.

8:4 <110 unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation; for
a law <32 proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a
<178 for the people.

8:5 My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arm
<36 judge the <21 The isles <6 wait upon me, and on mine arm
<9 they trust.

8:6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath;
for the heavens <24 vanish away like smoke, and the <13 <8 wax
old like a garment; and they that dwell therein <12 die in like
manner. But my <75 <9 be forever, and my <85 <6
not be abolished.

8:7 <136 unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose
heart I have written my law, fear ye not the reproach of men, <507
be ye afraid of their revilings.

8:8 For the moth <49 eat them up like a <385 and the worm <10
eat them like wool. But my <68 <9 be <74 and my
<81 from generation to generation.

8:9 Awake, awake! Put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake as in the
ancient days. Art thou not he that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the
dragon?

8:10 Art thou not he who hath dried the sea, the waters of the great
deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to
pass over?

8:11 Therefore, the redeemed of the Lord <92 return, and come with
singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy and holiness <14 be upon <137
heads; and they <8 obtain <327 and joy; sorrow and mourning
<9 flee away.

8:12 I am he; yea, I am he that comforteth you. Behold, who art thou,
that thou shouldst be <179 of man, who <30 die, and of the son of
man, who <10 be made like unto grass?

8:13 And forgettest the Lord thy maker, that hath stretched forth the
<299 and laid the foundations of the earth, and hast feared
continually every day, because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he
were ready to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor?

8:14 The captive exile hasteneth, that he may be loosed, and that he
should not die in the pit, nor that his bread <10 fail.

8:15 But I am the Lord thy God, <312 waves roared; the Lord of Hosts
is my name.

8:16 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the
shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the <407 and lay the
<119 of the <119 and say unto Zion: <176 thou art my
<460

8:17 <311 awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand
of the Lord the cup of his fury—thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup
of trembling wrung out—

8:18 And none to guide her among all the sons she hath brought forth;
<411 that taketh her by the <86 of all the sons she hath <16
up.

8:19 These two sons are come unto thee, who <242 be sorry for thee—thy
desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword—and by whom
<18 I comfort thee?

8:20 Thy sons have fainted, save these two; they lie at the head of all
the streets; as a wild bull in a net, they are full of the fury of the
Lord, the rebuke of thy God.

8:21 Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, and not with
wine:

8:22 Thus saith thy <30 the Lord and thy God pleadeth the cause of
his people; behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of
trembling, the <171 of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it
again.

8:23 But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; who
have said to thy soul: Bow down, that we may go over—and thou hast laid
thy body as the ground and as the street to them that went over.

8:24 <263 <263 put on thy strength, O <496 put on thy beautiful
garments, O <273 the holy city; for henceforth there <188 no
more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.

8:25 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit <73 O Jerusalem; loose
<11 from the bands of thy neck, O <419 daughter of Zion.

2 Nephi Chapter 9

9:1 And now, my beloved brethren, I have read <234 things that ye
might know concerning the covenants of the Lord that he has covenanted
with all the house of Israel—

9:2 That he has spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of his holy
prophets, even from the beginning <83 from generation to generation,
until the time comes that they <118 be restored to the true church and
fold of God; when they <14 be gathered home to the lands of their
inheritance, and <12 be established in all <9 <12 of promise.

9:3 <452 my <105 <105 I speak unto you <106 <106 that ye
may rejoice, and lift up your heads forever, because of the blessings
<462 the Lord God <43 bestow upon your children.

9:4 For I know that ye have searched much, many of you, to know of
<45 to come; wherefore I know that ye know that our flesh must waste
away and die; nevertheless, in our bodies we <47 see God.

9:5 Yea, I know that ye know that in the body he <18 show himself
unto those at <266 from whence we came; for it is expedient that
it should be among them; for it behooveth the great Creator that he
suffereth <31 to become subject unto man in the flesh, and die for
all men, that all men <239 <17 <17 unto him.

9:6 For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan
of the <49 Creator, <331 must needs be a power of resurrection, and
the resurrection must <11 come unto man by reason of the fall; and
the fall came by <10 of transgression; and <184 man became fallen
they were cut off from the presence of the Lord.

9:7 Wherefore, it must <41 be an infinite atonement—save it <119 be
an <7 atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption.
<23 the first judgment <225 came upon man must <29 have
remained to an endless duration. And if so, this <203 must have laid
down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.

9:8 O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace! For behold, if the <36
<73 rise no more our spirits must <166 <166 to that angel who
fell from before the <108 of the Eternal God, and <123 the devil,
to rise no <51

9:9 And our <33 must have <34 like unto him, and we <6
devils, angels to a <27 to be shut out from the <42 of our God,
and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself;
yea, to that being who beguiled our <143 parents, who transformeth
<269 nigh unto an <84 of light, and stirreth up the children of
men unto secret combinations of murder and all manner of <8 works
of darkness.

9:10 O how <261 the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our
escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, <299
and hell, <209 I call the <8 of the body, and also the <7 of the
spirit.

9:11 And <276 of the way of deliverance of our God, the Holy One of
Israel, this death, of <39 I have spoken, <4 is the temporal,
<413 deliver up its dead; <10 <43 is the grave.

9:12 And this <10 of <13 I have <27 <4 is the spiritual
<38 <28 <28 up its <28 <11 <9 <19 is hell;
wherefore, <5 and hell must <15 up their dead, and hell must
<8 up its captive spirits, and the grave must <9 up its
<10 bodies, and the <502 and the <236 of men will be restored
one to the other; and it is by the <418 of the <415 of the
Holy One of Israel.

9:13 O how <181 the plan of our God! For on the other hand, the
paradise of God must <61 up the <53 of the righteous, and the
<73 <11 up the body of the righteous; and the spirit and the body
is <71 to itself again, and all men <310 incorruptible, and
immortal, and they are living souls, having a perfect knowledge like
unto us in the flesh, save it be that our <13 <154 be perfect.

9:14 <450 we <9 have a <27 <14 of all our guilt, and
our uncleanness, and our nakedness; and the righteous <19 have a
<20 <20 of <171 enjoyment, and <3 righteousness, <342
clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness.

9:15 And it <30 come to pass that when all men <8 have passed from
this <370 <215 unto life, insomuch as they have <107 <104 they
must appear <454 the judgment-seat of the Holy One of Israel; and
then cometh the judgment, and then must they be judged according to the
holy judgment of God.

9:16 And assuredly, as the Lord liveth, for the Lord God hath spoken
it, and it is his eternal word, <288 cannot pass away, that they who
are <121 <83 be <3 still, and they who are filthy <9
be <4 still; <306 they who are <6 are the devil and his
angels; and they <19 go away into everlasting fire; prepared for
them; and <150 torment is as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame
ascendeth up forever and ever and has no end.

9:17 O the greatness and the justice of our God! For he executeth all
his words, and they have gone forth out of his mouth, and his law must
be fulfilled.

9:18 But, behold, the <307 the saints of the Holy One of <456
they who have believed in the Holy One of <11 they who have endured
the crosses of the world, and despised the shame of it, they <113
inherit the kingdom of God, <158 was <116 for them from the
foundation of the <26 and <122 joy <22 be full forever.

9:19 O the <106 of the mercy of our God, the Holy One of Israel!
For he delivereth his <84 from that awful monster the devil, and
<503 and hell, and that lake of fire and <160 <61 is endless
torment.

9:20 O how <446 the holiness of our God! For he knoweth all things,
and there is not anything save he knows it.

9:21 And he <298 into the world that he may save all men if they will
hearken unto his voice; for <164 he suffereth the pains of all men,
yea, the <7 of every <448 creature, both men, women, and children,
who belong to the family of Adam.

9:22 And he <33 this that the resurrection might pass upon all
men, that all <8 stand <379 him at the <100 and <359 day.

9:23 And he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be baptized
in his name, <510 <462 faith in the Holy One of <229 or they
<365 be saved in the <216 of God.

9:24 And if they will not repent and believe in his <35 and be
<43 in his <7 and endure to the end, they must be damned; for
the Lord God, the Holy One of <52 has <425 it.

9:25 Wherefore, he has given a law; and where <187 is no law <9
<6 is no punishment; and <12 <6 is no punishment <4 is no
condemnation; and <11 <7 is no condemnation the mercies of the
Holy One of Israel have claim upon them, because of the atonement; for
they are delivered by the power of him.

9:26 For the atonement satisfieth the demands of his <416 upon all
those who have not the law <72 to <39 that they are <34 from
that <313 monster, death and <309 and the <317 and the lake of fire
and <313 <313 is <313 torment; and they are restored to that
God who gave them breath, <16 is the Holy One of Israel.

9:27 But wo unto him that has the law given, yea, that has all the
commandments of God, like unto us, and that transgresseth <75 and
that wasteth the days of his probation, for <78 is his state!

9:28 O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the
frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think
they are wise, and they <363 not unto the counsel of God, for they
set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, <482
wisdom is <38 and it profiteth them not. And they <492 perish.

9:29 But to be <49 is good if they <45 unto the counsels of
God.

9:30 But wo unto the rich, who are rich as to the things of the world.
For <237 they are rich they despise the poor, and they persecute the
meek, and <69 hearts are upon <4 treasures; <76 <3
treasure is <4 God. And <460 <4 <7 <74 perish with
them also.

9:31 And wo unto the deaf that will not hear; for they <21 <95

9:32 Wo unto the blind that will not see; for they <16 <37 <34

9:33 Wo unto the uncircumcised of heart, for a knowledge of <56
iniquities <20 smite them at the last day.

9:34 Wo unto the liar, for he <17 be thrust down to hell.

9:35 Wo unto the murderer who deliberately killeth, for he <19 die.

9:36 Wo unto them who commit whoredoms, for they <14 be <33 down
to <34

9:37 Yea, wo unto <360 that worship idols, for the devil of all devils
delighteth in them.

9:38 And, in fine, wo unto all <24 who die in <95 sins; for they
<47 return to God, and behold his face, and remain in <16 sins.

9:39 O, my beloved brethren, remember the awfulness in transgressing
against that Holy God, and also the <11 of yielding to the
enticings of that <332 one. Remember, to be carnally-minded is
death, and to be spiritually-minded is life eternal.

9:40 O, my <46 <46 give ear to my words. Remember the
greatness of the Holy One of <420 Do not say that I have spoken hard
<283 <65 you; for if ye do, ye will revile <9 the truth; for
I have <20 the words of your Maker. I know that the <8 of truth
are hard <23 all uncleanness; but the righteous fear them not, for
they love the <18 and are not shaken.

9:41 O then, my <85 <85 come unto the Lord, the Holy One.
<88 that his paths are righteous. Behold, the way for man is
narrow, but it lieth in a straight course before him, and the keeper of
the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there;
and there is none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be
deceived, for the Lord God is his name.

9:42 And whoso knocketh, to him will he open; and the <504 and the
learned, and they that are <450 who are puffed up <442 of <247
learning, and <4 wisdom, and <3 riches—yea, they are they whom he
despiseth; and save they <277 cast these <189 away, and consider
themselves fools <106 God, and come down in the depths of humility,
he will not open unto <323

9:43 But the <30 of the wise and the prudent <40 be hid from them
forever—yea, that happiness which is prepared for the saints.

9:44 O, my <188 <188 <319 my <271 <177 I take off my
garments, and I shake them <67 you; I pray the God of my salvation
that he view me with his all-searching eye; wherefore, ye <57 know at
the last day, when all men <10 be judged of <123 works, that the God
of Israel did witness that I shook your <500 from my soul, and
that I stand with brightness <59 him, and am rid of your blood.

9:45 O, my <89 <89 turn away from your <437 <82 off the
chains of him that would bind you fast; come unto that God who is the
rock of your salvation.

9:46 Prepare your souls for that glorious day when justice <87 be
administered unto the righteous, even the day of judgment, that ye may
not shrink with awful fear; that ye may not <156 your <8 guilt
in perfectness, and be constrained to exclaim: Holy, holy are thy
judgments, O Lord God Almighty—but I know my guilt; I transgressed thy
law, and my transgressions are mine; and the devil hath obtained me,
that I am a prey to his <48 misery.

9:47 But behold, my <127 is it expedient that I should awake you
to an <21 reality of <291 things? Would I harrow up your <113 if
your minds were pure? <12 I be plain unto you according to the
plainness of the <459 if ye were freed from sin?

9:48 <265 if ye were holy I <172 speak unto you of holiness; but as
ye are not holy, and ye look upon me as a teacher, it must needs be
<82 that I teach you the consequences of sin.

9:49 <45 my soul abhorreth sin, and my heart delighteth in
righteousness; and I will praise the holy name of my God.

9:50 Come, my <126 every one that thirsteth, come ye to the
waters; and he that hath no money, come buy and eat; yea, come buy wine
and milk without money and <3 price.

9:51 Wherefore, do not spend <12 for that <399 is of no worth, nor
your labor for that <11 cannot satisfy. Hearken diligently unto me,
and <249 the words <12 I have spoken; and come unto the Holy One
of Israel, and feast upon that <17 perisheth not, neither can be
corrupted, and let your soul delight in fatness.

9:52 <131 my <359 <106 <43 the <43 of your God; pray
unto him continually by day, and give thanks unto his holy name by
night. Let your hearts rejoice.

9:53 And behold how great the covenants of the Lord, and how <8 his
condescensions unto the children of men; and because of his greatness,
and his grace and mercy, he has promised unto us that our seed <387
not utterly be destroyed, <274 to the flesh, but that he <257
preserve them; and in future generations they <22 become a righteous
branch unto the house of Israel.

9:54 And now, my <111 I <29 <286 unto you more; but on the
morrow I will declare unto you the remainder of my words. Amen.

2 Nephi Chapter 10

10:1 And now I, Jacob, <35 unto you again, my <155 <44
concerning this <63 <62 of <184 I have spoken.

10:2 For <405 the promises <12 we have <428 are <6 unto
us <106 to the flesh; wherefore, as it has been shown unto me that
many of our <151 <108 perish in the flesh <153 of unbelief,
nevertheless, God will be merciful unto many; and our <19 <19 be
restored, that they may come to that <56 will give them the true
knowledge of their Redeemer.

10:3 <314 as I said unto you, it must <403 be <402 that
Christ—for in the last night the angel spake unto me that this <496
be his name—should come among the Jews, <3 those who are the more
wicked part of the world; and they <73 crucify him—for thus it
behooveth our God, and there is none other nation on earth that <198
<19 <75 God.

10:4 For <51 the mighty miracles be wrought <48 <22 nations they
<21 repent, and know that he be <25 God.

10:5 But <140 of priestcrafts and iniquities, they at Jerusalem will
stiffen <18 necks against him, that he be crucified.

10:6 <124 <24 of <15 <23 destructions, famines,
pestilences, and bloodshed <87 come upon <296 and they who <7 not
be destroyed <5 be scattered <68 all nations.

10:7 But <232 thus saith the Lord God: When the day cometh that they
<24 believe in me, that I am Christ, then have I covenanted with
<58 fathers that they <18 be restored in the <359 upon the earth,
unto the lands of <18 inheritance.

10:8 And it <22 come to pass that they <6 be gathered in from
<20 long dispersion, from the isles of the sea, and from the four
parts of the earth; and the <159 of the Gentiles <30 be <451 in
the eyes of me, <96 God, in carrying them forth to the <63 of <43
<64

10:9 Yea, the kings of the <32 <32 be nursing <96 unto them,
and <21 queens <10 <441 <10 mothers; <351 the <361
of the Lord are <52 unto the Gentiles, for he hath spoken it, and who
can dispute?

10:10 But <162 this land, said God, <36 be a land of thine
inheritance, and the <57 <11 be blessed upon the land.

10:11 And this land <13 be a land of liberty unto the <53 and
<302 <12 be no <89 upon the <45 who <8 raise up unto the
Gentiles.

10:12 And I will fortify this land <272 all <305 <237

10:13 And he that fighteth <12 Zion <31 perish, <146 God.

10:14 For he that raiseth up a king <17 me <17 <17 for I, the
Lord, the king of heaven, will be <143 king, and I will be a light
unto them forever, that hear my words.

10:15 <326 for this cause, that my covenants may be fulfilled
<476 I have made unto the <493 of men, that I will do unto them
while they are in the <288 I must <477 destroy the secret works of
darkness, and of murders, and of abominations.

10:16 <53 he that <109 <92 Zion, both Jew and Gentile,
both bond and free, both male and female, <105 perish; for they are
they who are the whore of all the <296 for they who are not for me
are <39 me, <146 our God.

10:17 For I will fulfil my <265 <100 I have made unto the <100
of men, that I will do unto them <100 they are in the flesh—

10:18 <84 my beloved brethren, thus <44 our God: I will
afflict thy seed by the hand of the Gentiles; nevertheless, I will
soften the hearts of the <259 that they <97 be like unto a
father to <489 <335 the <295 <12 be <295 and numbered
<487 the house of Israel.

10:19 <59 I will consecrate this land unto thy seed, and them
who <28 be <26 <25 thy <10 <224 for the land of <240
inheritance; for it is a choice <311 <87 God unto me, above all
<298 lands, wherefore I will have all men that dwell thereon that they
<41 worship me, <24 God.

10:20 And now, my <123 <123 seeing that our merciful God has
given us so <423 knowledge concerning these things, let us remember
him, and lay aside our sins, and not hang down our heads, for we are
not cast off; <145 we have been driven out of the land of our
<92 but we have been led to a better <95 for the Lord has
made the sea our path, and we are upon an isle of the sea.

10:21 But <74 are the <241 of the Lord unto them who are upon the
isles of the sea; <128 as it says isles, <461 must <338 be more
than this, and they are inhabited also by our brethren.

10:22 For behold, the Lord God has led away from time to time from the
<217 of Israel, according to his will and pleasure. And now <25
the Lord remembereth all them who have been broken off, <63 he
<11 us also.

10:23 Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and <164 that ye are free to
act for yourselves—to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of
eternal life.

10:24 <276 my <212 <212 reconcile yourselves to the will
of God, and not to the will of the devil and the flesh; and remember,
after ye are reconciled unto God, that it is only in and through the
grace of God that ye are saved.

10:25 <52 may God raise you from <70 by the power of the
resurrection, and also from <82 <12 by the <12 of the
atonement, that ye may be received into the <91 kingdom of God,
that ye may praise him <57 <55 divine. Amen.

2 Nephi Chapter 11

11:1 And now, Jacob spake many more things to my people at that time;
nevertheless only <321 <11 have I caused to be written, for the
<10 <499 I have written sufficeth me.

11:2 And now I, Nephi, write more of the words of Isaiah, for my soul
delighteth in his words. For I will liken his <16 unto my people, and
I will send them forth unto all my children, for he verily saw my
Redeemer, even as I have seen him.

11:3 And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I have seen him;
<512 I will send <474 <51 <42 unto my children to prove unto
them that my <12 are true. <186 by the <6 of three, God hath
said, I will establish my word. Nevertheless, God sendeth more
witnesses, and he proveth all his <98

11:4 Behold, my soul <109 in proving unto my <158 the truth of
the coming of Christ; for, for this end hath the law of Moses been
given; and all <163 <163 have been <505 of God from the beginning
of the world, unto man, are the typifying of him.

11:5 And also my soul <57 in the covenants of the Lord <35 he
hath made to our fathers; yea, my soul <18 in his grace, and in
his justice, and power, and mercy in the <486 and <279 plan of
deliverance from death.

11:6 And my soul <31 in <106 unto my <106 that save Christ
should come all men must perish.

11:7 For if <501 be no <17 <4 be no God; and if <6 be no God
we are not, for <9 could have been no creation. But <7 is a God,
and he is Christ, and he cometh in the fulness of his own time.

11:8 And now I <300 some of the <215 of <300 that whoso of my
<81 shall see <341 <12 may lift up <250 hearts and rejoice for
all men. Now <14 are the words, and ye may <318 them unto you and
unto all men.

2 <398 <398 12

12:1 The word that <53 the son of Amoz, saw concerning Judah and
Jerusalem:

12:2 And it <63 come to pass in the last days, when the mountain of
the Lord’s house <16 be established in the top of the mountains, and
<11 be exalted above the hills, and all nations <9 flow unto it.

12:3 And many <110 <11 go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the
<51 of the Lord, to the <52 of the God of Jacob; and he will
teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion
<47 go <400 the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

12:4 And he <19 judge among the nations, and <6 rebuke many
people: and they <7 beat <184 swords into plow-shares, and <5
spears into pruning-hooks—nation <12 not lift up sword against
nation, neither <9 they learn war any more.

12:5 O <91 of <481 come ye and let us walk in the light of the
Lord; yea, come, for ye have all gone astray, every one to his wicked
ways.

12:6 Therefore, O <131 thou hast forsaken thy people, the <44 of
<45 because they be replenished from the east, and hearken unto
soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the
children of strangers.

12:7 Their land also is full of silver and gold, <98 is <348 any
end of <118 treasures; <2 land is also full of horses, <16 is
<17 any end of <14 chariots.

12:8 <38 land is also full of idols; they worship the work of <18
own hands, that <482 <6 own fingers have made.

12:9 And the mean man boweth not down, and the <475 man humbleth
himself not, therefore, forgive him not.

12:10 O ye <139 ones, enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust,
for the fear of the Lord and the glory of his majesty <203 smite thee.

12:11 And it <9 come to pass that the lofty looks of man <10 be
humbled, and the haughtiness of men <9 be bowed <75 and the Lord
alone <9 be <360 in that day.

12:12 For the day of the Lord of Hosts soon <497 upon all <292
yea, upon <231 one; yea, upon the proud and lofty, and upon <10 one
who is lifted up, and he <45 be brought low.

12:13 Yea, and the day of the Lord <15 come upon all the cedars of
Lebanon, for they are high and <33 up; and upon all the oaks of
Bashan;

12:14 And upon all the high <456 and upon all the <453 and upon
all the <456 <202 are <33 up, and upon <75 people;

12:15 And upon <8 high tower, and upon <5 fenced wall;

12:16 And upon all the ships of the sea, and upon all the <8 of
Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.

12:17 And the loftiness of man <101 be <170 <170 and the <179
of men <10 be made low; and the Lord <179 <8 be <179 in that
day.

12:18 And the idols he <15 utterly abolish.

12:19 And they <9 go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves
of the earth, for the fear of the Lord <22 come upon them and the
<273 of his <273 <11 <273 them, when he ariseth to shake
terribly the earth.

12:20 In that day a man <21 cast his <68 of silver, and his <5
of <412 <164 he hath made for <348 to worship, to the moles and to
the bats;

12:21 To go into the clefts of the <86 and into the tops of the
ragged <9 for the fear of the Lord <55 come upon them and the
<84 of his <90 <11 <87 <87 when he <87 to <87
<87 the <87

12:22 Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein
is he to be accounted of?

2 Nephi Chapter 13

13:1 For behold, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, doth take away from
Jerusalem, and from Judah, the stay and the staff, the whole staff of
bread, and the <7 stay of water—

13:2 The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet,
and the prudent, and the ancient;

13:3 The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor,
and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.

13:4 And I will give children unto them to be their princes, and babes
<146 rule over them.

13:5 And the people <11 be oppressed, <359 one by another, and <5
one by his neighbor; the child <16 behave <224 proudly against the
ancient, and the base <7 the honorable.

13:6 When a man <21 take hold of his brother of the house of his
father, and <14 say: Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let
not this ruin come under thy hand—

13:7 In that day <26 he swear, saying: I will not be a healer; for in
my <46 there is neither bread nor clothing; make me not a ruler of
the people.

13:8 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen, because <136
tongues and <4 doings have been <101 the <238 to provoke the
eyes of his glory.

13:9 The show of <22 countenance doth witness <22 <306 and doth
declare <10 sin to be even as Sodom, and they cannot hide it. Wo unto
<15 souls, for they have rewarded evil unto themselves!

13:10 Say unto the righteous that it is well with them; for they <119
eat the fruit of <31 doings.

13:11 Wo unto the wicked, for they <18 perish; for the reward of
<19 hands <9 be upon them!

13:12 And my people, <255 are <15 oppressors, and women rule over
<251 O my <13 they who lead thee cause thee to err and destroy the
way of thy paths.

13:13 The Lord standeth up to plead, and <5 to judge the <172

13:14 The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his <295
and the princes thereof; for ye have eaten up the vineyard and the
spoil of the poor in your houses.

13:15 What mean ye? Ye beat my <33 to pieces, and grind the faces of
the poor, saith the Lord God of Hosts.

13:16 Moreover, the Lord saith: Because the daughters of Zion are
haughty, and walk with stretched-forth necks and wanton eyes, walking
and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with <144 feet—

13:17 Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head
of the <48 of Zion, and the Lord will discover <30 secret
parts.

13:18 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of <19 <52
ornaments, and cauls, and round tires like the moon;

13:19 The chains and the bracelets, and the mufflers;

13:20 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands,
and the tablets, and the ear-rings;

13:21 The rings, and nose jewels;

13:22 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the
wimples, and the crisping-pins;

13:23 The glasses, and the fine linen, and hoods, and the veils.

13:24 And it <301 come to pass, instead of sweet smell <440 <9 be
stink; and <10 of a girdle, a rent; and <7 of well set hair,
baldness; and <8 of a stomacher, a girding of sackcloth; burning
<10 of beauty.

13:25 Thy men <39 fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war.

13:26 And her gates <18 lament and mourn; and she <6 be desolate,
and <5 sit upon the ground.

2 Nephi Chapter 14

14:1 And in that day, seven <383 <22 take hold of one man, saying:
We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be
called by thy name to take away our reproach.

14:2 In that day <40 the branch of the Lord be beautiful and
glorious; the <475 of the earth excellent and comely to them that are
escaped of Israel.

14:3 And it <33 come to <172 they that are left in Zion and remain
in Jerusalem <15 be <66 holy, every one that is written among the
living in Jerusalem—

14:4 When the Lord <22 have washed away the filth of the <339 of
<340 and <13 have purged the blood of <42 from the midst
thereof by the spirit of <474 and by the <6 of burning.

14:5 And the Lord will create upon <64 dwelling-place of mount <39
and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a
flaming fire by night; for upon all the glory of Zion <66 be a
defence.

14:6 And <290 <11 be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from
the heat, and for a place of refuge, and a covert from storm and from
rain.

2 <246 <246 15

15:1 And then will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved,
touching his vineyard. My <11 hath a vineyard in a very
fruitful hill.

15:2 And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted
it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the <164 of it, and
also made a wine-press therein; and he looked that it should bring
forth grapes, and it brought <5 wild grapes.

15:3 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I
pray you, betwixt me and my <89

15:4 What could have been done more to my <97 that I have not done
in it? Wherefore, when I <62 that it <62 <62 <56 grapes it
<61 <5 wild <61

15:5 And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard—I
will take away the hedge <127 and it <211 be eaten up; and I will
break down the wall <15 and it <15 be trodden down;

15:6 And I will lay it waste; it <15 not be pruned nor digged; but
<250 <9 come up briers and thorns; I will also command the clouds
that they rain no rain upon it.

15:7 For the <118 of the Lord of Hosts is the house of Israel, and
the men of Judah his pleasant plant; and he <128 for judgment, and
behold, oppression; for righteousness, but <5 a cry.

15:8 Wo unto them that join <36 to house, till <75 can be no place,
that they may be placed alone in the <242 of the earth!

15:9 In mine ears, said the Lord of Hosts, of a truth many houses <109
be desolate, and great and fair cities without inhabitant.

15:10 Yea, ten acres of <102 <20 yield one bath, and the seed of
a homer <11 <11 an ephah.

15:11 Wo unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may
follow strong drink, that continue until night, and wine inflame them!

15:12 And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine are in
their feasts; but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither
consider the operation of his hands.

15:13 Therefore, my people are gone into captivity, because they have
no knowledge; and <37 honorable men are famished, and <6 multitude
dried up with thirst.

15:14 <31 hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth
<138 measure; and <24 glory, and <3 multitude, and <3 pomp,
and he that rejoiceth, <132 descend into it.

15:15 And the mean man <12 be <357 down, and the mighty man <8
be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty <10 be humbled.

15:16 But the Lord of <282 <12 be exalted in <268 and God that
is holy <11 be sanctified in righteousness.

15:17 Then <10 the lambs feed after <75 manner, and the waste
places of the fat ones <16 strangers eat.

15:18 Wo unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as
it were with a cart rope;

15:19 That say: Let him make speed, hasten his work, that we may see
it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come,
that we may know it.

15:20 Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil, that put
darkness for light, and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet,
and sweet for bitter!

15:21 Wo unto the wise in <120 own eyes and prudent in <6 own
sight!

15:22 Wo unto the <187 to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle
<325 drink;

15:23 Who justify the wicked for reward, and take away the
righteousness of the righteous from him!

15:24 <269 as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame
consumeth the chaff, <63 root <180 be rottenness, and <6 blossoms
<7 go up as dust; <321 they have cast away the law of the Lord of
<452 and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

15:25 <55 is the anger of the Lord kindled against his people,
and he hath stretched forth his hand <11 them, and hath smitten
them; and the hills did tremble, and <67 carcasses were torn in the
midst of the streets. For all this his <44 is not turned away, but
his hand is <42 out still.

15:26 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will
hiss unto them from the end of the earth; and behold, they <123 come
with speed swiftly; none <7 be weary nor stumble among them.

15:27 None <12 slumber nor sleep; <481 <5 the girdle of <87
loins be loosed, nor the latchet of <9 shoes be broken;

15:28 Whose arrows <23 be sharp, and all <15 bows bent, and <4
horses’ hoofs <13 be counted like flint, and <10 wheels like a
whirlwind, <6 roaring like a lion.

15:29 They <22 roar like young lions; yea, they <7 roar, and lay
hold of the prey, and <10 carry away safe, and none <6 deliver.

15:30 And in that day they <11 roar <190 them like the <49 of
the sea; and if they look unto the land, <136 <362 and sorrow,
and the <364 is darkened in the heavens thereof.

2 Nephi Chapter 16

16:1 In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting
upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.

16:2 Above it stood the seraphim; each one had six wings; with twain he
covered his face, and with <8 he <7 his feet, and with <7 he
did fly.

16:3 And one cried unto another, and said: Holy, holy, <1 is the
Lord of Hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.

16:4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried,
and the house was <89 with smoke.

16:5 Then said I: Wo is unto me! for I am undone; <408 I am a man of
unclean lips; and I dwell in the <356 of a people of <12 <12 for
mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts.

16:6 Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his
hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;

16:7 And he laid it upon my mouth, and <135 Lo, this has touched thy
<63 and thine iniquity is <32 <419 and thy sin purged.

16:8 Also I heard the <130 of the Lord, saying: Whom <282 I send, and
who will go for us? Then I <44 Here am I; send me.

16:9 And he <12 Go and tell this people—Hear ye indeed, but they
understood not; and see ye <9 but they perceived not.

16:10 Make the heart of this <145 fat, and make <384 ears heavy, and
shut <6 eyes—lest they see with <5 eyes, and hear with <5
ears, and understand with <6 heart, and be converted and be healed.

16:11 Then said I: <98 how long? And he <76 Until the cities be
wasted without inhabitant, and the houses <5 man, and the land be
utterly desolate;

16:12 And the Lord have removed men far <151 for there <135 be a
great forsaking in the <237 of the land.

16:13 But yet <19 <19 be a tenth, and they <6 return, and <3
be eaten, as a teil-tree, and as an oak whose substance is in them when
they cast <103 leaves; so the holy seed <26 be the <17
<445

2 <445 <445 17

17:1 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son
of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah the son
of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against
it, but could not prevail <7 it.

17:2 And it was told the <395 of David, <272 Syria is confederate
with Ephraim. And his <228 was moved, and the <5 of his people, as
the trees of the wood are <435 with the wind.

17:3 Then said the Lord unto Isaiah: Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou
and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in
the highway of the fuller’s field;

17:4 And say unto him: Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be
faint-hearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the
fierce anger of Rezin with <143 and of the son of Remaliah.

17:5 Because <12 Ephraim, and the son of <154 have <415 evil
counsel <143 thee, <131

17:6 Let us go up <11 Judah and vex it, and let us make a breach
therein for us, and set a king in the <288 of it, yea, the son of
Tabeal.

17:7 Thus saith the Lord God: It <261 not stand, <98 <4 it come
to pass.

17:8 For the head of <197 is Damascus, and the head of <5
Rezin; and within three score and five years <31 Ephraim be broken
that it be not a people.

17:9 And the head of <18 is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is
Remaliah’s son. If ye will not believe surely ye <38 not be
established.

17:10 Moreover, the Lord spake again unto <223 <138

17:11 Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the depths,
or in the heights above.

17:12 But Ahaz <471 I will not ask, <123 will I tempt the Lord.

17:13 And he <17 Hear ye now, O <326 of David; is it a small thing
for you to weary men, but will ye <5 my God also?

17:14 Therefore, the Lord himself <99 give you a sign—Behold, a
virgin <8 conceive, and <3 bear a son, and <5 call his name
Immanuel.

17:15 Butter and honey <13 he eat, that he may know to refuse the
evil and to choose the good.

17:16 For before the child <25 know to <20 the evil and <18 the
good, the land that thou abhorrest <16 be forsaken of both her kings.

17:17 The Lord <13 bring upon <308 and upon thy <425 and upon thy
father’s house, days that have not come from the day that <224
departed from <505 the king of Assyria.

17:18 And it <38 come to pass in that day that the Lord <10 hiss
for the fly that is in the uttermost part of Egypt, and for the bee
that is in the land of <42

17:19 And they <32 come, and <3 rest all of them in the desolate
valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon
all bushes.

17:20 In the same day <34 the Lord shave with a razor that is hired,
by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the
hair of the feet; and it <32 also consume the beard.

17:21 And it <11 come to pass in that day, a man <9 nourish a
young cow and two sheep;

17:22 And it <15 come to pass, for the abundance of milk they <10
give he <4 eat butter; for butter and <259 <7 every one eat that
is left in the land.

17:23 And it <17 come to pass in that day, <23 place <9 be,
where there were a thousand vines at a <4 silverlings, which
<15 be for briers and thorns.

17:24 With arrows and with bows <15 men come thither, because all the
land <9 become <23 and <23

17:25 And all hills that <13 be digged with the mattock, <54 <7
not come thither the fear of <26 and thorns; but it <13 be for the
sending forth of oxen, and the treading of lesser cattle.

2 Nephi Chapter 18

18:1 <502 the word of the Lord said unto me: Take thee a great
roll, and write in it with a man’s pen, concerning
Maher-shalal-hash-baz.

18:2 And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest,
and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

18:3 And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived and bare a son.
Then said the Lord to me: Call his name, <51

18:4 For behold, the <443 <111 not have knowledge to cry, My father,
and my mother, <458 the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria
<23 be taken away <15 the king of <372

18:5 The Lord spake also unto me again, saying:

18:6 Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go
softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son;

18:7 Now therefore, <77 the Lord bringeth up upon them the <28
of the <368 strong and many, even the king of Assyria and all his
glory; and he <79 come up over all his channels, and go over all his
banks.

18:8 And he <20 pass through Judah; he <5 overflow and go over, he
<7 reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings <13
fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.

18:9 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye <21 be broken in
pieces; and give ear all ye of far countries; gird <21 and ye
<19 be <19 in <18 gird <10 and ye <9 be <9 in
pieces.

18:10 Take counsel together, and it <15 come to naught; speak the
word, and it <10 not stand; for God is with us.

18:11 For the Lord <198 thus to me with a <155 hand, and instructed
me that I should not walk in the way of this <93 <216

18:12 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all to whom this <223 <54 say,
A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.

18:13 Sanctify the Lord of Hosts himself, and let him be your <19 and
let him be your dread.

18:14 And he <42 be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling,
and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and a
snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

18:15 And many among them <44 stumble and fall, and be broken, and be
snared, and be taken.

18:16 Bind up the testimony, seal the law <27 my disciples.

18:17 And I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the
house of Jacob, and I will look for him.

18:18 Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for
signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of Hosts, which dwelleth
in Mount Zion.

18:19 And when they <97 say unto you: Seek unto them that have
familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep and mutter—should not a
<206 seek unto <200 God for the living to hear from the dead?

18:20 To the law and to the testimony; and if they <292 not according
to this <295 it is because there is no light in them.

18:21 And they <71 pass <407 it hardly bestead and hungry; and it
<11 come to pass that when they <7 be hungry, they <4 fret
themselves, and curse <74 king and <3 God, and look upward.

18:22 And they <20 look unto the earth and behold trouble, and
darkness, dimness of anguish, and <15 be driven to darkness.

2 Nephi Chapter 19

19:1 Nevertheless, the <22 <19 not be such as was in her
vexation, when at first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun, and
the land of Naphtali, and afterwards did more grievously afflict by the
way of the Red Sea beyond Jordan in Galilee of the nations.

19:2 The <177 that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they
that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the <163
shined.

19:3 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and increased the joy—they joy
before thee <194 to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when
they divide the spoil.

19:4 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his
shoulder, the rod of his oppressor.

19:5 For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and
garments rolled in blood; but this <161 be with burning and fuel of
fire.

19:6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the
government <30 be upon his shoulder; and his name <8 be called,
Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The
Prince of Peace.

19:7 Of the increase of <34 and peace <315 is no end, upon the
throne of David, and upon his kingdom to order it, and to establish it
with judgment and with justice from henceforth, even forever. The zeal
of the Lord of Hosts will perform this.

19:8 The Lord sent his word unto Jacob and it hath lighted upon Israel.

19:9 And all the <241 <95 know, even Ephraim and the inhabitants of
Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart:

19:10 The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones;
the sycamores are cut <13 but we will change them into cedars.

19:11 Therefore the Lord <55 set up the adversaries of Rezin against
him, and join his enemies together;

19:12 The Syrians <274 and the Philistines behind; and they <28
devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned
away, but his hand is stretched out still.

19:13 For the <114 turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do
they seek the Lord of Hosts.

19:14 <82 will the Lord cut off from <55 head and tail, branch
and rush in one day.

19:15 The ancient, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies,
he is the tail.

19:16 For the leaders of this <69 cause them to err; and they that
are led of them are destroyed.

19:17 <67 the Lord <121 have no joy in their young men, <91
<10 have mercy on <9 fatherless and widows; for <373 one of them
is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and <12 mouth speaketh folly. For all
this his <150 is not <150 <149 but his hand is <149 out <149

19:18 For wickedness burneth as the fire; it <53 <183 the briers
and thorns, and <8 kindle in the thickets of the forests, and they
<11 mount up like the lifting up of smoke.

19:19 Through the wrath of the Lord of <335 is the land darkened, and
the <132 <29 be as the fuel of the <57 no man <10 spare his
brother.

19:20 And he <11 snatch on the right hand and be hungry; and he <11
eat on the left hand and they <9 not be satisfied; they <5 eat
<129 man the flesh of his own arm—

19:21 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; they together <22 be
<324 Judah. For all this his <148 is not <148 <148 but his hand
is <149 out <149

2 Nephi Chapter 20

20:1 Wo unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write
grievousness which they have prescribed;

20:2 To turn away the needy from judgment, and to take away the <108
from the poor of my people, that widows may be <242 prey, and that
they may rob the fatherless!

20:3 And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the
desolation <61 <107 come from far? to whom will ye flee for help?
and where will ye leave your glory?

20:4 Without me they <26 bow down under the prisoners, and they <8
fall <8 the slain. For all this his <142 is not <142 <142 but
his hand is <142 out <142

20:5 O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in <102 hand is
<4 indignation.

20:6 I will send him <190 a hypocritical nation, and <5 the
<270 of my <286 will I give him a charge to take the spoil, and to
take the <142 and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.

20:7 Howbeit he meaneth not so, <412 doth his heart think so; but in
his <7 it is to destroy and cut off nations not a few.

20:8 For he saith: Are not my princes altogether kings?

20:9 Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not Samaria
as Damascus?

20:10 As my hand hath founded the kingdoms of the idols, and whose
graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;

20:11 Shall I not, as I have done unto <43 and her <29 so do to
<24 and to her idols?

20:12 Wherefore it <213 come to pass that when the Lord hath performed
his whole work upon Mount Zion and upon Jerusalem, I will punish the
fruit of the stout <132 of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his
high looks.

20:13 For he <134 By the strength of my hand and by my wisdom I have
done these things; for I am prudent; and I have moved the borders of
the <361 and have robbed <254 treasures, and I have put down the
inhabitants like a valiant man;

20:14 And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people; and as
one gathereth eggs that are left have I gathered all the earth; and
there was none that <62 the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.

20:15 <175 the ax boast itself <309 him that heweth therewith?
<11 the saw magnify <11 <11 him that shaketh it? As if the rod
should shake <13 <13 them that lift it up, or as if the <364
<15 lift up <16 as if it were no wood!

20:16 Therefore <204 the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, send among his fat
ones, leanness; and <429 his <184 he <19 kindle a burning like the
<4 of a fire.

20:17 And the light of Israel <20 be for a fire, and his Holy One for
a flame, and <14 burn and <3 devour his thorns and his briers in
one day;

20:18 And <16 consume the <58 of his forest, and of his fruitful
field, both soul and body; and they <19 be as when a standard-bearer
fainteth.

20:19 And the rest of the trees of his forest <21 be few, that a
child may write them.

20:20 And it <16 come to pass in that day, that the remnant of
Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, <23 no more
again stay upon him that smote them, but <12 stay upon the <165 the
Holy One of <33 in truth.

20:21 The <44 <19 return, yea, even the <6 of <39 unto
the mighty God.

20:22 For though thy people <165 be as the sand of the sea, yet a
<27 of them <35 return; the consumption decreed <5 overflow
with righteousness.

20:23 For the Lord God of Hosts <15 make a consumption, even
determined in all the land.

20:24 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God of Hosts: O my <60 that
dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian; he <38 smite thee
with a rod, and <8 lift up his <304 <315 thee, after the manner
of Egypt.

20:25 For yet a very little while, and the indignation <26 cease, and
mine anger in <437 destruction.

20:26 And the Lord of <90 <18 stir up a scourge for him according
to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and as his rod was upon
the sea so <29 he lift it up <71 the <71 of <70

20:27 And it <16 come to pass in that day that his burden <10 be
taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and
the yoke <20 be destroyed because of the anointing.

20:28 He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath
laid up his carriages.

20:29 They are gone over the passage; they have <59 up <130 lodging
at Geba; Ramath is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.

20:30 Lift up the voice, O daughter of Gallim; cause it to be heard
unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.

20:31 Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves
to flee.

20:32 As yet <102 he remain at Nob that day; he <8 shake his hand
<229 the mount of the <54 of <257 the hill of Jerusalem.

20:33 Behold, the <368 the Lord of <213 <28 lop the bough with
terror; and the high ones of stature <13 be hewn down; and the
haughty <8 be humbled.

20:34 And he <9 cut down the thickets of the forests with iron, and
Lebanon <13 fall by a <394 one.

2 Nephi Chapter 21

21:1 And there <19 come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a
branch <15 grow out of his roots.

21:2 And the Spirit of the Lord <16 rest upon him, the spirit of
wisdom and understanding, the <7 of counsel and might, the <6
of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;

21:3 And <34 make him of quick understanding in the fear of the <17
and he <15 not judge <324 the sight of his eyes, neither reprove
<9 the hearing of his ears.

21:4 But with righteousness <25 he <25 the poor, and <21 with
equity for the meek of the earth; and he <18 <450 the earth with the
rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips <18 he slay the
wicked.

21:5 And <48 <12 be the girdle of his loins, and
faithfulness the <8 of his reins.

21:6 The wolf also <22 dwell with the lamb, and the leopard <8 lie
down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and fatling
together; and a <501 child <22 lead them.

21:7 And the cow and the bear <13 feed; <376 <26 ones <5 lie
down <27 and the lion <8 eat straw like the ox.

21:8 And the suckling <40 <14 play on the hole of the asp, and the
weaned <13 <13 put his hand on the cockatrice’s den.

21:9 They <13 not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, for the
<158 <14 be full of the <238 of the <360 as the waters cover
the sea.

21:10 And in that day <310 <25 be a root of <305 which <7 stand
for an ensign of the people; to it <11 the Gentiles seek; and his
rest <8 be glorious.

21:11 And it <9 come to pass in that day that the Lord <10 set his
hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people <55
<18 be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from
Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the
islands of the sea.

21:12 And he <38 set up an <93 for the nations, and <9 assemble
the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from
the four corners of the earth.

21:13 The envy of Ephraim also <31 depart, and the adversaries of
<25 <8 be cut off; <14 <5 not envy Judah, and <11 <6
not vex Ephraim.

21:14 But they <11 fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines towards
the west; they <13 spoil them of the east <273 they <8 lay
<285 hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon <14 obey
<312

21:15 And the Lord <11 utterly <254 the tongue of the Egyptian
sea; and with his mighty wind he <16 shake his hand over the river,
and <9 <429 it in the seven streams, and make men go over dry shod.

21:16 And <262 <20 be a highway for the <211 of his <211 <211
<12 be <211 from <211 like as it was to Israel in the day that
he came up out of the land of Egypt.

2 Nephi Chapter 22

22:1 And in that day thou shalt say: O <335 I will praise thee; though
thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away, and thou
comfortedst me.

22:2 Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid; for
the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also has become my
salvation.

22:3 Therefore, with joy <107 ye draw water out of the wells of
<18

22:4 And in that day <19 ye say: Praise the <87 call upon his name,
declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is
exalted.

22:5 Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things; this is
known in all the <315

22:6 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy
One of <183 in the midst of thee.

2 <174 <174 23

23:1 The burden of Babylon, <216 Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

23:2 Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto
them, <281 the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.

23:3 I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my <313
<8 for mine <217 is not upon them that rejoice in my highness.

23:4 The noise of the multitude in the mountains like as of a <114
<160 a tumultuous <16 of the kingdoms of nations gathered
together, the Lord of Hosts mustereth the hosts of the battle.

23:5 They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, yea, the
<211 and the weapons of his indignation, to <405 the whole land.

23:6 Howl ye, for the day of the Lord is at hand; it <244 come as a
destruction from the Almighty.

23:7 Therefore <14 all hands be faint, every man’s heart <8 melt;

23:8 And they <8 be <321 pangs and sorrows <6 take hold of
them; they <7 be amazed one at another; <498 faces <8 be as
flames.

23:9 <360 the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and
fierce anger, to lay the land desolate; and he <31 <103 the
sinners thereof out of it.

23:10 For the stars of heaven and the constellations <16 <22 not
give <59 light; the sun <8 be darkened in his going forth, and the
moon <11 not cause her light to shine.

23:11 And I will punish the world for evil, and the wicked for <38
iniquity; I will <26 the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will
lay down the haughtiness of the terrible.

23:12 I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than
the golden wedge of Ophir.

23:13 <463 I will <329 the heavens, and the earth <83 remove
out of her place, in the <145 of the Lord of Hosts, and in the day of
his <155 anger.

23:14 And it <30 be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man
taketh up; and they <18 <236 man turn to his own <329 and flee
<10 one into his own <287

23:15 Every one that is <123 <26 be thrust through; yea, and <21
one that is joined to the <150 <15 fall by the sword.

23:16 Their children, also <12 be dashed to pieces before <167 eyes;
<3 houses <11 be spoiled and <6 wives ravished.

23:17 <269 I will stir up the Medes against <467 <494 <21 not
regard silver and gold, nor <8 they delight in it.

23:18 <52 bows <11 also dash the young men to pieces, and they
<11 have no pity on the fruit of the womb; <57 eyes <12 not spare
children.

23:19 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees’
excellency, <22 be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

23:20 It <14 never be inhabited, neither <5 it be dwelt in from
generation to generation: <11 <11 the Arabian pitch tent there;
<8 <8 the shepherds make <66 fold there.

23:21 But wild beasts of the desert <17 lie <22 and <17 <146
<7 be full of doleful creatures; and owls <8 dwell there, and
satyrs <6 dance <34

23:22 And the wild <35 of the islands <14 cry in <34 desolate
houses, and dragons in <7 pleasant palaces; and her time is near to
come, and her day <24 not be prolonged. For I will <441 her
speedily; yea, for I will be merciful unto my <275 but the <245
<24 perish.

2 Nephi Chapter 24

24:1 For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel,
and set them in <69 own land; and the strangers <37 be <289 with
<246 and they <8 cleave to the house of Jacob.

24:2 And the people <14 take them and bring them to <35 place; yea,
from far unto the ends of the earth; and they <21 return to <17
lands of promise. And the <41 of Israel <13 possess <53 and the
land of the Lord <10 be for servants and handmaids; and they <8
take them captives unto whom they were captives; and they <12 rule
over <44 oppressors.

24:3 And it <12 come to pass in that day that the Lord <10 give
thee rest, from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard
bondage wherein thou wast made to serve.

24:4 And it <30 come to pass in that day, that thou shalt take up
this proverb <395 the king of <344 and say: How hath the
oppressor ceased, the golden city ceased!

24:5 The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, the scepters of the
rulers.

24:6 He who smote the <176 in wrath with a continual stroke, he that
ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth.

24:7 The whole earth is at <114 and is quiet; they break forth into
singing.

24:8 Yea, the fir-trees rejoice at thee, and also the cedars of
Lebanon, saying: Since thou art laid down no feller is come up <111
us.

24:9 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming; it
stirreth up the dead for <46 even all the chief ones of the <259 it
hath raised up from <216 thrones all the kings of the nations.

24:10 All they <182 speak and say unto thee: Art thou also become weak
as we? Art thou <7 like unto us?

24:11 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave; the noise of thy viols is
not heard; the worm is spread under <75 and the worms cover thee.

24:12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!
Art thou cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations!

24:13 For thou hast said in thy heart: I will ascend into <35 I
will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also upon the
mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north;

24:14 I will <37 <29 the heights of the clouds; I will be like the
Most High.

24:15 Yet thou <325 be <127 down to hell, to the <39 of the pit.

24:16 They that see thee <172 narrowly look upon <130 and <6
consider <5 and <5 say: Is this the man that made the <289 to
tremble, that did shake kingdoms?

24:17 And made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities
thereof, and opened not the <488 of his prisoners?

24:18 All the <241 of the nations, yea, all of <500 lie in glory,
every one of them in his own house.

24:19 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and
the remnant of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that
go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcass trodden <250 feet.

24:20 Thou <150 not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast
<102 thy land and slain thy people; the seed of evil-doers <142
never be renowned.

24:21 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquities of <357
fathers, that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face
of the <155 with cities.

24:22 For I will rise up <430 <137 saith the Lord of Hosts, and cut
off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, <19 the
Lord.

24:23 I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of
water; and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, <33 the
Lord of Hosts.

24:24 The Lord of Hosts hath sworn, <511 Surely as I have thought,
so <127 it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so <11 it stand—

24:25 That I will bring the Assyrian in my <124 and upon my mountains
tread him <191 foot; then <26 his yoke depart from off <120 and his
burden <8 from off <160 shoulders.

24:26 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth; and
this is the hand that is stretched out upon all nations.

24:27 For the Lord of <100 hath <82 and who <57 disannul? And
his hand is <25 out, and who <11 turn it back?

24:28 In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.

24:29 Rejoice not thou, <64 Palestina, <274 the rod of him that
smote thee is broken; for out of the serpent’s root <44 come forth a
cockatrice, and his fruit <9 be a fiery flying serpent.

24:30 And the first-born of the poor <16 feed, and the needy <5
lie down in safety; and I will kill thy root with famine, and he <16
slay thy remnant.

24:31 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; <81 <81 <81 art dissolved;
for there <23 come from the north a smoke, and none <9 be alone in
his appointed times.

24:32 What <13 then answer the messengers of the nations? That the
Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people <21 trust in it.

2 Nephi Chapter 25

25:1 Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat concerning the words which I have
written, <5 have been spoken by the mouth of Isaiah. For behold,
Isaiah spake many things <16 were hard for many of my <53 to
understand; for they know not <39 the manner of prophesying
among the Jews.

25:2 For I, <58 have not taught them many <37 <22 the
<23 of the Jews; for <300 works were <2 of darkness, and <7
doings were <2 of abominations.

25:3 Wherefore, I write unto my people, unto all those that <118
receive hereafter these <42 <79 I write, that they may know the
judgments of God, that they come upon all nations, according to the
word <23 he hath spoken.

25:4 <47 hearken, O my <46 <13 are of the house of Israel,
and give ear unto my words; for <304 the <154 of <138 are not
plain unto you, nevertheless they are <6 unto all <76 that are
filled with the spirit of prophecy. But I give unto you a prophecy,
<68 to the <14 <54 is in me; wherefore I <102 prophesy
<13 to the plainness <13 hath been with me from the time that I
came out from Jerusalem with my father; for <207 my soul delighteth
in <26 unto my <96 that they may learn.

25:5 Yea, and my soul <19 in the <94 of Isaiah, for I came out
from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath beheld the <164 of the Jews, and I
know that the Jews do understand the <14 of the prophets, and <350
is none other <259 that <14 the <14 <89 were <286 unto
the Jews like unto them, save it be that they are <254 after the
<251 of the <24 of the <274

25:6 But <102 I, <275 have not <21 my children <23 the <22
of the <274 but <16 I, of myself, have dwelt at <91
<155 I know <294 the regions round about; and I have made
mention unto my <34 <14 the <259 of God, <79 hath
come to pass <335 the <113 unto my children, <184 to all that
<17 <234 hath spoken, and I do not <310 them.

25:7 But <63 I proceed with mine own <225 <27 to my
plainness; in the <29 I know that no man can err; nevertheless, in
the days that the prophecies of <45 <239 be fulfilled men <4
know of a surety, at the times when they <11 come to pass.

25:8 <327 they are of worth unto the <100 of men, and he that
supposeth that they are not, unto them will I <486 particularly, and
confine the <240 unto mine own people; for I know that they <47 be
of great <40 unto them in the last days; for in that day <16 they
<227 them; wherefore, for <447 good have I written <128

25:9 And as one generation hath been destroyed <160 the Jews <389
of iniquity, even so have they been <13 from <18 to
<3 <145 to <37 iniquities; and never hath any of them
been <18 save it were foretold them by the prophets of the Lord.

25:10 <125 it hath been told them <223 the destruction
<176 should come upon <296 immediately <267 my father left
Jerusalem; <180 they hardened <51 hearts; and <56 to
my prophecy they have been destroyed, save it be <455 <31 are
carried away captive into Babylon.

25:11 And now this I <159 <101 of the <455 <21 is in me. And
notwithstanding they have been <28 away they <145 return again,
and possess the land of <63 <150 they <12 be restored
again to the land of <71 inheritance.

25:12 But, <283 they <18 have wars, and rumors of wars; and when
the day cometh that the Only Begotten of the Father, yea, even the
Father of heaven and of earth, <30 manifest himself unto them in the
flesh, <41 they will reject him, <91 of <55 iniquities, and
the hardness of <7 hearts, and the stiffness of <6 necks.

25:13 Behold, they will crucify him; and <160 he is laid in a
sepulchre for the space of three days he <56 rise from the dead, with
healing in his wings; and all <164 who <15 believe on his name <5
be saved in the kingdom of God. <220 my soul delighteth to
prophesy <221 him, for I have seen his day, and my heart doth
magnify his holy name.

25:14 And behold it <40 come to pass that <80 the Messiah hath
risen from the <69 and hath manifested <131 unto his people, unto
as many as will <71 on his name, <138 Jerusalem <33 be
<303 again; for wo unto them that fight against God and the people
of his church.

25:15 <88 the Jews <27 be scattered <360 all nations; yea,
and also Babylon <11 be destroyed; <240 the Jews <6 be
<18 by other nations.

25:16 And <84 they have been scattered, and the Lord God hath
scourged them by <21 nations for the <172 of many generations, yea,
even down from <396 to <2 until they <44 be persuaded
to <99 in Christ, the Son of God, and the atonement, <325 is
infinite for all mankind—and when that day <25 come that they <4
<26 in <26 and worship the <280 in his <131 with pure hearts
and clean hands, and look not forward any more for another Messiah,
then, at that time, the day will come that it must needs be expedient
that they <436 <45 these things.

25:17 And the Lord will set his hand <371 the second time to restore
his <171 from <308 lost and fallen state. <169 he will proceed
to do a marvelous work and a wonder <176 the children of men.

25:18 <22 he <100 bring forth his words unto <493 <121 <4
<10 judge them at the last day, for they <9 be given them for the
purpose of convincing them of the true <106 who was rejected by
them; and unto the <15 of them that they need not look <129
any more for a <300 to come, for there <116 not any <6 save it
<7 be a false <16 <67 <6 deceive the people; for <19 is
save one <12 spoken of by the prophets, and that <8 is he who
<23 be <64 of the Jews.

25:19 For according to the <104 of the <25 the <24 <502 in
six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem; and
<25 to the <25 of the <25 and also the word of the angel
of God, his name <134 be Jesus <252 the Son of God.

25:20 And now, my brethren, I have <85 plainly that ye cannot err.
And as the Lord God liveth that brought Israel up out of the land of
Egypt, and gave unto Moses power that he <104 heal the <351 <367
they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents, if they would cast
<250 eyes unto the serpent <152 he did raise up before <226 and also
gave him <39 that he <39 smite the rock and the water <7 come
forth; yea, <505 I say unto you, that as <312 things are true, and
as the Lord God liveth, <191 is none <421 name <255 under heaven
save it be this <129 <129 of <61 I have spoken, whereby man can
be saved.

25:21 <303 for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that
<54 <54 <29 I write <166 be kept and preserved, and handed down
unto my seed, from <464 to generation, that the promise may be
fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed <99 never perish as long as the
earth <9 stand.

25:22 <61 <49 <49 <46 go from <36 to <2 as
long as the <21 <12 stand; and they <4 go <249 to the will
and pleasure of God; and the <189 who <15 possess them <3 be
judged of them <22 to the <271 <93 are written.

25:23 For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and
also our <262 to <485 in <149 and to be reconciled to God;
for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, <248 all we can do.

25:24 And, notwithstanding we <34 in <34 we keep the law of
Moses, and look <427 with steadfastness unto <14 until the law
<88 be fulfilled.

25:25 For, for this end was the law given; wherefore the law hath
become dead unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of our
faith; yet we keep the law <10 of the commandments.

25:26 And we talk of <58 we rejoice in <4 we preach of <4
we prophesy of <5 and we <238 <152 to our prophecies, that
our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of
<357 sins.

25:27 <222 we speak concerning the law that our <28 may know
the deadness of the law; and they, by knowing the <9 of the law,
may look <135 unto that life <208 is in <67 and know for what
end the law was given. And <178 the law is <295 in <18 that
they need not harden <67 hearts against him when the law ought to be
done away.

25:28 And now behold, my people, ye are a stiffnecked people;
wherefore, I have <505 <505 unto you, that ye <507
misunderstand. And the <279 <71 I have <15 <205 stand as a
testimony <51 you; for they are sufficient to teach any man the
right way; for the <4 way is to <252 in <203 and deny him not;
for by denying him ye also deny the prophets and the law.

25:29 And now <80 I say unto you that the <37 way is to <37
in <120 and deny him not; and <44 is the Holy One of Israel;
<270 ye must bow down before him, and worship him with all your
might, mind, and strength, and your whole soul; and if ye do this ye
<109 in nowise be cast out.

25:30 And, inasmuch as it <14 be expedient, ye must keep the
performances and ordinances of God <345 the law <16 be <197
<147 was given unto Moses.

2 Nephi Chapter 26

26:1 And <220 <89 <23 have risen from the dead he <7 show
himself unto you, my <443 and my beloved brethren; and the <188
<42 he <18 <294 unto you <4 be the law <10 ye <6 do.

26:2 For <152 I say unto you that I have beheld that many
generations <20 pass away, and there <5 be great wars and
contentions among my people.

26:3 And <77 the Messiah <18 come <21 <3 be signs <101 unto
my people of his birth, and also of his death and resurrection; and
<39 and terrible <23 that day be unto the wicked, for they <9
perish; and they perish <445 they cast out the prophets, and the
saints, and stone them, and slay them; <217 the cry of the blood
of the saints <32 ascend up to God from the ground <309 them.

26:4 <429 all those who are proud, and that do wickedly, the day
that cometh <29 burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, for they <11
be as stubble.

26:5 And they that kill the <75 and the <74 the depths of the
earth <24 swallow them up, <35 the Lord of Hosts; and mountains
<12 cover <92 and whirlwinds <5 carry them <172 and buildings
<7 fall upon them and crush them to pieces and grind them to powder.

26:6 And they <20 be visited with thunderings, and lightnings, and
earthquakes, and all manner of destructions, for the fire of the anger
of the Lord <25 be kindled <128 <59 and they <7 be as
stubble, and the day that <121 <10 consume <15 <85 the Lord of
Hosts.

26:7 O the pain, and the anguish of my soul for the loss of the slain
of my people! For I, Nephi, have seen it, and it well nigh consumeth me
<417 the presence of the Lord; but I must cry unto my God: Thy ways
are just.

26:8 But <321 the righteous that hearken unto the <349 of the
<175 and destroy them not, but look forward unto <384 with
steadfastness for the <306 <357 are given, notwithstanding all
persecution—behold, they are they <10 <106 not perish.

26:9 But the Son of righteousness <12 appear unto <282 and he <6
heal <125 and they <6 have peace with him, <456 three <378
<9 have passed <208 and many of the fourth generation <10 have
<11 away in righteousness.

26:10 And when these things have passed away a speedy destruction
cometh unto my people; for, notwithstanding the pains of my soul, I
have seen it; wherefore, I know that it shall come to pass; and they
sell themselves for naught; for, for the reward of their pride and
<4 foolishness they <23 reap destruction; for because they yield
unto the devil and choose works of darkness rather than light,
therefore they must go down to hell.

26:11 For the Spirit of the Lord will not always strive with man. And
when the <14 ceaseth to <10 with man then <98 <102
destruction, and this grieveth my soul.

26:12 And as I spake concerning the convincing of the Jews, that Jesus
is the very Christ, it must needs be that the Gentiles be convinced
also that <18 is the <16 the Eternal God;

26:13 And that he manifesteth himself unto all those who believe in
him, by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kindred,
tongue, and people, working mighty miracles, signs, and wonders, among
the children of men according to <153 faith.

26:14 But behold, I prophesy unto you <91 the last days;
<5 the days when the Lord God <174 bring <229 <229 forth
unto the <37 of men.

26:15 After my seed and the seed of my brethren <24 have dwindled in
unbelief, and <7 have been smitten by the Gentiles; yea, after the
Lord God <13 have camped against them round about, and <8 have
laid siege <10 them with a mount, and raised forts <8 them;
and <30 they <19 have been brought down low in the dust, even that
they are not, yet the words of the righteous <21 be written, and the
prayers of the faithful <10 be heard, and all <167 who have <84
in unbelief <12 not be forgotten.

26:16 For <16 who <11 be destroyed <3 speak unto them out of the
ground, and <162 speech <12 be low out of the <67 and <10 voice
<11 be as one that hath a familiar spirit; for the Lord God will give
unto him power, that he may whisper <181 them, even as it were
out of the ground; and <38 <48 <37 <16 out of the dust.

26:17 For thus saith the Lord God: They <17 write the <205 which
<6 be done <246 <40 and they <7 be written and sealed up in a
book, and <106 who have <122 in <121 <17 not have <23 for
they seek to destroy the <38 of God.

26:18 Wherefore, as <26 who have been <132 have been <3
speedily; and the multitude of <83 terrible ones <37 be as chaff
that passeth away—yea, thus <81 the Lord God: It <14 be at an
instant, suddenly—

26:19 And it <13 come to pass, that <49 who have <75 in
<76 <12 be <279 by the hand of the Gentiles.

26:20 And the <410 are lifted up in the <512 of <65 eyes, and
have stumbled, <510 of the greatness of <11 stumbling block, that
they have built up many churches; nevertheless, they put down the <413
and miracles of God, and preach up unto <560 <27 own wisdom and
<5 own learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of
the poor.

26:21 And there are many churches <51 up <196 cause envyings, and
strifes, and malice.

26:22 And <19 are also secret combinations, even as in times of old,
<456 to the combinations of the devil, for he is the founder of
all <443 things; yea, the <8 of murder, and <614 of darkness;
yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he
bindeth them with his strong cords forever.

26:23 For <501 my beloved brethren, I say unto you that the Lord God
worketh not in darkness.

26:24 He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world;
for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he
may draw all men unto him. <288 he commandeth none that they
<237 not partake of his salvation.

26:25 Behold, doth he cry unto any, saying: Depart from me? <10 I
say unto you, Nay; but he saith: Come unto me all ye ends of the earth,
buy milk and honey, without money and <3 price.

26:26 <33 hath he commanded any that they should depart out of the
synagogues, or out of the houses of worship? <21 I say unto you,
Nay.

26:27 Hath he <31 any that they <31 not <91 of his
salvation? Behold I say unto you, Nay; but he hath given it free for
all men; and he hath <30 his people that they <31 persuade all
men to repentance.

26:28 <59 hath the Lord <20 any that they <19 not <50
of his goodness? <50 I say unto you, Nay; but all men are privileged
the one like unto the other, and none are forbidden.

26:29 He <180 that <307 <178 be no priestcrafts; for, behold
priestcrafts are that men <369 and set <369 up for a light unto
the <225 that they may get gain and praise of the <241 but they
seek not the welfare of Zion.

26:30 <91 the Lord hath forbidden this thing; <981 the Lord
God hath <130 a commandment that all men <102 have charity, <389
charity is love, and except they <11 have <8 they were nothing.
<268 if they <10 have <10 they would not suffer the
laborer in Zion to perish.

26:31 But the <11 in Zion <109 labor for Zion; for if they <6
for <252 they <12 <23

26:32 And again, the Lord God hath <174 that men <50 not
murder; that they <6 not lie; that they <5 not steal; that they
<6 not take the name of the Lord <510 God in vain; that they
<15 not envy; that they <5 not have malice; that they <6 not
contend one with another; that they <9 not commit whoredoms; and
that they <8 do none of <481 <481 for whoso <424 them <85
<86

26:33 For none of <16 iniquities come of the Lord; for he <20 that
<159 is good <742 the <950 of men; and he <13 nothing save it
be plain unto the <14 of men; and he inviteth them all to come
unto him and <295 of his goodness; and he denieth none that come
unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he
remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and
Gentile.

2 Nephi Chapter 27

27:1 But, <553 in the last days, or in the days of the Gentiles—yea,
<319 all the nations of the <730 and also the <1158 both <758
who <133 come upon this land and <9 who <8 be upon other lands,
yea, even upon all the lands of the <501 <51 they will be drunken
with iniquity and all manner of abominations—

27:2 And when that day <36 come they <3 be visited of the Lord of
Hosts, with thunder and with earthquake, and with a great noise, and
with storm, and with tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire.

27:3 And all the <99 that fight <1090 Zion, and that distress
her, <50 be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it <11 be unto <938
even as unto a hungry man <231 dreameth, and <137 he eateth but he
awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man <21
<22 and <22 he drinketh but he <21 and <7 he is faint,
and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so <56 the <964 of all the
<84 be that <85 <85 Mount <475

27:4 For <160 all ye that <289 iniquity, stay yourselves and
wonder, for ye <32 cry out, and cry; yea, ye <7 be <178 but not
with wine, ye <9 stagger but not with <806 drink.

27:5 For <41 the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep
sleep. For <15 ye have closed your <974 and ye have rejected the
prophets; and your rulers, and the seers hath he covered <986 of
your iniquity.

27:6 And it <60 come to pass that the Lord God <8 <1345 <1343 unto
you the <1264 of a <1128 and they <13 be the <9 of them <159 have
slumbered.

27:7 And <157 the book <18 be sealed; and in the book <7 be a
revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending
thereof.

27:8 <596 <80 of the <1163 <46 are <1190 up, the <6
<7 are <7 <37 not be delivered in the day of the wickedness
and abominations of the people. Wherefore the book <19 be kept from
them.

27:9 But the book <13 be <31 unto a man, and he <8 deliver
the <103 of the <112 <51 are the <7 of <402 who have slumbered
in the <1334 and he <23 <23 <543 <15 unto <577

27:10 But the <9 <28 are <79 he <17 not deliver, neither
<5 he <23 the book. For the book <8 be <17 by the <1157 of
God, and the <137 <29 was <12 <15 be kept in the book
<1066 the own due time of the Lord, that they may come forth; for
<246 they reveal all <139 from the foundation of the <165 unto
the end <165

27:11 And the day <1693 that the <81 of the book <55 were <55
<56 be read upon the house tops; and they <9 be read by the <80
of Christ; and all <50 <12 be revealed unto the <638 of men
<34 ever have been <662 the <10 of men, and <10 ever will be
even unto the end of the earth.

27:12 <235 at that day when the book <42 be <195 unto the
man of whom I have spoken, the book <14 be hid from the eyes of the
<922 that the eyes of none <15 <304 it save it be that three
witnesses <10 <10 it, by the <93 of God, besides him to whom the
book <15 be delivered; and they <5 testify to the truth of the
book and the <113 therein.

27:13 And <999 is none <651 <104 <23 view it, save it be a few
<1308 to the will of God, to bear testimony of his word unto the
<133 of men; for the Lord God hath said that the <188 of the
<1667 <847 <1641 as if it were from the dead.

27:14 <142 the Lord God will proceed to <443 <443 the <28 of
the book; and in the mouth of as many <119 as seemeth him good
will he establish his word; and wo be unto him that rejecteth the word
of God!

27:15 But <282 it <105 come to pass that the Lord God <8 say
unto him to whom he <8 <344 the book: Take <370 <64 <129 are
not <279 and <12 them to another, that he may show them unto the
learned, <1312 Read this, I pray thee. And the learned <35 say:
Bring hither the <424 and I will read <452

27:16 And now, <497 of the glory of the <349 and to get gain will
they say <40 and not for the <17 of God.

27:17 And the man <48 say: I cannot <148 the <48 for it is sealed.

27:18 Then <16 the <67 say: I <18 read it.

27:19 <525 it <14 come to <1664 that the Lord God will <109
again the book and the <123 thereof to him that is not learned; and
the man that is not <43 <32 say: I am not learned.

27:20 Then <11 the Lord God say unto him: The <20 <9 not read
<843 for they have <710 <5 and I am able to do mine own work;
wherefore thou shalt read the <61 <184 I <28 give unto <165

27:21 Touch not the <337 <14 are sealed, for I will <124 them
<274 in mine own due time; for I will show unto the <323 of men
that I am able to do mine own work.

27:22 <311 when thou hast read the <59 <45 I have <1244
thee, and obtained the <305 <10 I have promised unto <10 then
<81 thou seal up the book <1270 and hide it up unto me, that I may
preserve the <38 <28 thou hast not read, <608 I <102 see fit in
mine own <1778 to <602 all <102 unto the <83 of men.

27:23 For <335 I am God; and I am a God of miracles; and I will show
unto the <276 that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and I
work not <582 the <43 of men save it be <470 to <1323 <2234

27:24 And <243 it <74 come to pass that the Lord <7 say unto him
that <6 read the <98 that <5 be <590 him:

27:25 Forasmuch as this <1581 draw near unto me with <44 mouth, and
with <5 lips do honor me, but have removed <8 hearts far from me,
and <7 fear towards me is taught by the precepts of men—

27:26 Therefore, I will <505 to do a marvelous work <98 this
<2340 yea, a <8 work and a <1050 for the <159 of <39
wise and <303 <81 perish, and the understanding of <11 prudent
<9 be hid.

27:27 And wo unto them that seek deep to hide <19 counsel from the
Lord! And <7 <1898 are in the dark; and they say: Who seeth us, and
who knoweth us? And they also say: Surely, your turning of <219
upside down <52 be esteemed as the potter’s clay. But <220 I will
show unto <369 <2113 the Lord of <1278 that I know all <53 works.
For <28 the work say of him that made it, he made me not? Or <14
the thing framed say of him that <5 it, he had no understanding?

27:28 But <54 <48 the Lord of Hosts: I will show unto the
<251 of men that it is yet a very little while and Lebanon <45 be
turned into a fruitful field; and the <4 field <12 be <99
as a forest.

27:29 And in that day <15 the deaf hear the <263 of the <562 and
the eyes of the blind <16 see out of obscurity and out of <2017

27:30 And the meek also <17 increase, and <126 joy <5 be in the
<994 and the poor <242 men <11 rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

27:31 For assuredly as the Lord liveth they <19 see that the <2295
one is <2495 to naught, and the scorner is consumed, and all that
watch for <1488 are cut off;

27:32 And they that make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare
for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a <197
of naught.

27:33 <340 thus <189 the <97 who redeemed Abraham, <2463
the <1051 of Jacob: Jacob <83 not now be ashamed, <1146 <6 his
face now wax pale.

27:34 But when he <304 his children, the work of my hands, in the
midst of him, they <29 sanctify my name, and <4 the Holy One of
Jacob, and <13 fear the God of <148

27:35 They also that erred in <1409 <16 come to understanding, and
they that murmured <9 learn doctrine.

2 <1695 <1695 28

28:1 And now, <292 my <2248 I have spoken unto you, <533 as
the <2872 hath constrained me; <1970 I know that they must surely
come to pass.

28:2 And the <391 <629 <51 be <2550 out of the book <7 be of
<1650 worth unto the <330 of men, and especially unto our seed,
<25 is a remnant of the <158 of <103

28:3 For it <32 come to pass in that day that the <2414 <25 are
<2417 up, and not unto the <193 when the one <23 say unto the other:
<2064 I, I am the Lord’s; and the others <15 say: I, I am the
<11 and thus <10 <2901 one say that hath <41 up churches, and
not unto the Lord—

28:4 And they <21 <1969 one with <1392 and <353 priests <8
<9 one with <1023 and they <8 teach with <13 <2517 and
deny the Holy Ghost, <86 giveth utterance.

28:5 And they deny the <1223 of God, the Holy One of Israel; and they
say unto the people: Hearken unto us, and hear ye our precept; for
<1252 <1216 is no God <752 for the Lord and the Redeemer hath done
his work, and he hath <2174 his <47 unto men;

28:6 <132 hearken ye unto my <37 if they <84 say <38 is a
miracle wrought by the hand of the <163 <3048 it not; for this day
he is not a God of <826 he hath done his <920

28:7 Yea, and <37 <40 be many <116 <4 say: Eat, drink, and be
merry, for tomorrow we die; and it <14 be well with us.

28:8 And <29 <11 also be many <30 <5 say: Eat, <30 and be
merry; <2702 fear God—he will justify in committing a <604
sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one <1175 of his words,
dig a pit for thy neighbor; <45 is no harm in this; and do all <1243
things, for <73 we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God
will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we <77 be saved in the
kingdom of God.

28:9 Yea, and <53 <16 be many <97 <4 <255 <3080 this manner,
false and vain and foolish doctrines, and <13 be puffed up in <270
hearts, and <9 seek deep to hide <9 counsels from the <2231 and
<7 <831 <14 be in the dark.

28:10 And the blood of the saints <15 cry from the ground <1963
<1309

28:11 Yea, they have all gone out of the way; they have become
corrupted.

28:12 Because of pride, and <154 of <81 teachers, and <3
doctrine, <59 <425 have <22 corrupted, and <6 <6 are
<2922 up; <20 of <2922 they are <95 up.

28:13 They rob the poor <15 of <23 fine sanctuaries; they rob the
poor <10 of <10 fine clothing; and they persecute the meek and
the poor in heart, <16 in <16 <42 they are <42 up.

28:14 They wear stiff necks and high heads; yea, and <21 of <86
and wickedness, and abominations, and whoredoms, they have all gone
astray save it be a few, who are the humble followers of <1740
<285 they are led, that in many instances they do err <40
they are <1079 by the <1079 of men.

28:15 O the wise, and the <1498 and the rich, that are <80 up in
the <88 of <91 <220 and all <1917 who <2655 <156 <236
and all <8 who <2484 <78 and pervert the right way of the
<421 wo, wo, wo be unto <1023 <786 the Lord God Almighty, for they
<227 be thrust down to hell!

28:16 Wo unto them that turn <824 the just for a <824 of naught and
revile <248 that <307 is good, and say that is of no worth! For the
day <42 come that the Lord God will speedily visit the inhabitants of
the earth; and in that day that they are fully ripe in <909 they
<28 <2562

28:17 But <769 if the <28 of the earth <14 repent of <126
<2085 and <2084 they <9 not be destroyed, <105 the Lord
of Hosts.

28:18 But <31 that <756 and abominable church, the whore of all
the <2458 must tumble to the <5 and <17 must be the fall
<1993

28:19 For the <432 of the <3732 must shake, and they <120 belong to
it must <3667 be stirred up unto repentance, or the <19 will grasp
them with his everlasting chains, and they be <18 up to anger, and
perish;

28:20 For <78 at that day <97 he rage in the <1352 of the
<841 of men, and stir them up to anger <182 that <62 is good.

28:21 And <799 will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal
security, that they will say: All is well in <2825 yea, Zion
prospereth, all is well—and thus the <86 cheateth <163 souls, and
<3219 them away carefully down to <3833

28:22 And <80 <49 he flattereth away, and telleth them <557 is
no hell; and he <184 unto them: I am no <3276 for <15 is none—and
thus he whispereth in <47 ears, <1581 he grasps them with his awful
<137 from whence <21 is no deliverance.

28:23 Yea, they are grasped with death, and <47 and <4 and hell,
and the <46 and all that have been seized therewith must stand
before the throne of God, and be judged <1036 to <57 works, from
<49 they must go into the place prepared for <376 even a lake of
fire and brimstone, <166 is endless torment.

28:24 <1180 wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion!

28:25 Wo be unto him that crieth: All is well!

28:26 Yea, wo be unto him that hearkeneth unto the <485 of men, and
<2859 the <892 of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost!

28:27 Yea, wo be unto him that <3296 We have received, and we need no
more!

28:28 And in fine, wo unto all <495 who tremble, and are angry <545
of the <2193 of God! For <216 he that is <1050 upon the rock
receiveth it with gladness; and he that is <13 upon a sandy
<2372 trembleth lest he <318 fall.

28:29 Wo be unto him that <11 say: We have received the word of God,
and we need no more of the word of God, for we have enough!

28:30 For <66 thus <269 the Lord God: I will give unto the
<361 of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a <930 and
<264 a little; and blessed are <112 who <1038 unto my precepts, and
lend an ear unto my counsel, for they <77 <1304 wisdom; for unto him
that <113 I will give more; and from them that <17 say, We have
enough, from them <8 be taken away even that <251 they have.

28:31 Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his
arm, or <29 <69 unto the <233 of men, save <304 <5
<11 be <1129 by the <238 of the Holy Ghost.

28:32 Wo be unto the Gentiles, <130 the Lord God of Hosts! For
<4326 I <29 lengthen out mine arm unto them from day to
day, they will deny me; <788 I will be merciful unto <345
<34 the Lord God, if they will <636 and come unto me; for mine arm
is lengthened out all the day long, <23 the Lord God of <640

2 <1448 <1448 29

29:1 But <207 <182 <67 be many—at that day when I <7 <1898
to do a <1891 work <1657 <61 that I may remember my covenants
<154 I have made unto the <227 of men, that I may set my hand
<2005 the second time to recover my <1928 <24 are of the <1436 of
<1316

29:2 And also, that I may <45 the promises <20 I have made unto
<2141 Nephi, and also unto thy father, that I <3449 <19 your seed;
and that the <1775 of your seed <2508 <88 <2215 out of my <2483
unto your <19 and my <17 <102 hiss <14 unto the ends of the
<750 for a standard unto my <77 <57 are of the <77 of <76

29:3 And <420 my <31 <31 hiss forth—many of the <3271 <6
say: A Bible! A <2 We have got a Bible, and <160 <2388 be any
more Bible.

29:4 But thus <192 the Lord God: O fools, they <33 have a Bible; and
it <7 <91 <77 from the <3313 mine ancient covenant <2942 And
what thank they the Jews for the Bible <81 they receive from them?
Yea, what do the <71 mean? Do they <136 the travails, and the
labors, and the <4622 of the <41 and <333 diligence unto me, in
bringing <53 salvation unto the Gentiles?

29:5 O ye <330 have ye remembered the <25 mine <66 <66
people? Nay; but ye have cursed <252 and have hated <4 and have not
sought to <234 <1257 But <284 I will return all <1371 <1704 upon
your own <1164 for I the Lord have not forgotten my <107

29:6 Thou fool, that <124 say: A <156 we have got a <5 and we
need no more <160 Have ye <2403 a <125 save it were by the Jews?

29:7 Know ye not that <186 are more <3294 than one? Know ye not that
I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I <148 <546
who are upon the isles of the sea; and that I rule in the heavens above
and in the <1065 beneath; and I <2516 <155 my word unto the <371
of men, yea, even upon all the <62 of the earth?

29:8 <2639 murmur ye, <284 that ye <114 <217 more of my
word? Know ye not that the <2872 of two <29 is a witness unto
you that I am God, that I <84 one nation like unto another?
<2548 I <2873 the same <325 unto one <13 like unto another.
And when the two <37 <53 run together the <45 of the two
<10 <10 run <10 also.

29:9 And I do this that I may prove unto many that I am the same
<2502 <1750 and <2502 and that I <57 <123 my <57
<928 to mine own pleasure. And <108 that I have <1977 one word
ye need not suppose that I <383 <26 <1847 for my work is not yet
finished; <2087 <68 it be <1016 the end of man, <9 from that
time henceforth and <4274

29:10 <116 <47 that ye have a <251 ye need not <45 that
it contains all my words; <30 need ye <11 that I have not
caused more to be written.

29:11 For I command all men, both in the east and in the west, and in
the north, and in the south, and in the islands of the sea, that they
<88 <4620 the <125 <441 I <105 unto <4767 for out of the books
<11 <16 be <2073 I will judge the <3178 <1993 man <146 to
<438 <1075 <5 to that <19 is <73

29:12 For <403 I <28 <39 unto the Jews and they <7 <51 it;
and I <6 also <14 unto the Nephites and they <8 <14 it; and I
<6 also <14 unto the <3174 tribes of the <594 of Israel, <49 I
have led <1218 and they <20 <26 it; and I <5 also <25 unto all
<259 of the <357 and they <12 <17 it.

29:13 And it <9 come to pass that the Jews <7 have the <124 of
the Nephites, and the <72 <11 have the <11 of the Jews; and
the <11 and the Jews <14 have the <14 of the lost <79 of
<671 and the lost <7 of Israel <17 have the <17 of the
<28 and the Jews.

29:14 And it <17 come to pass that my <708 <107 are of the <114
of <115 <15 be gathered home unto the <3945 of <177 possessions;
and my word also <15 be <15 in one. And I will show unto them
that <3812 <1419 my word and <4 my <44 who are of the <44
of <44 that I am God, and that I covenanted with Abraham that I
<815 <447 his seed <332

2 <917 <917 30

30:1 And now <231 my <4614 <2366 I <23 <181 unto you; for
I, <853 <8 not <4295 that ye <839 <339 that ye are more
<5032 than the <728 <89 be. For <32 <4331 ye <6 keep
the commandments of God ye <8 all likewise <1539 and <388 of
the <156 <136 have been <439 ye need not <41 that the <35
are utterly destroyed.

30:2 For <41 I say unto you that as many of the <20 as will
<1039 are the <746 <2941 of the <2014 and as many of the Jews as
will not <18 <63 be cast off; for the Lord covenanteth with none
save it be with them that <18 and <2233 in his Son, who is the
Holy One of <2434

30:3 And now, I <131 <5258 somewhat more <2609 the Jews and
the <4933 For <2105 the book of <107 I have <107 <58 come
forth, and be <425 unto the <837 and <3412 up <1053 unto the
<1869 <753 <19 be many <26 <4 <63 the <138 <5 are
written; and they <10 carry them <597 unto the <2506 of our seed.

30:4 And then <16 the <12 of our seed know <72 us, how
that we came out from Jerusalem, and that they are descendants of the
<335

30:5 And the gospel of <5423 Christ <36 be declared <1153 <518
<2604 they <8 be restored unto the knowledge of <331 fathers,
and also to the <9 of <26 <5447 <84 was had <26 <15
fathers.

30:6 And then <31 they rejoice; for they <5 know that it is a
blessing unto them from the hand of God; and <30 scales of <5569
<21 begin to fall from <10 eyes; and many generations <10 not
pass away <51 <974 save they <9 be a pure and delightsome <953

30:7 And it <13 come to pass that the Jews <78 are scattered also
<12 <44 to <173 in <2120 and they <8 <8 to gather in
upon the face of the land; and as many as <16 <22 in <137 <4
also <2244 a <53 <53

30:8 And it <13 come to pass that the Lord God <8 commence his
work <83 all nations, kindreds, tongues, and <458 to <941 about
the restoration of his <336 upon the <3893

30:9 And with righteousness <31 the Lord God <694 the poor, and
reprove with equity for the meek of the <25 And he <20 smite the
<630 with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips <18
he slay the wicked.

30:10 For the time <2113 <4015 that the Lord God <19 <5188 a
<2045 division <89 the <85 and the wicked will he destroy; and he
will spare his <13 yea, even if it so be that he must <5380 the
<23 by <4485

30:11 And <100 <43 be the girdle of his loins, and
faithfulness the <8 of his reins.

30:12 And then <21 the wolf dwell with the lamb; and the leopard
<11 lie down with the kid, and the calf, and the young lion, and the
fatling, together; and a <1692 child <22 lead <1230

30:13 And the cow and the bear <13 feed; <288 <27 ones <5 lie
down <27 and the lion <8 eat straw like the ox.

30:14 And the sucking <40 <14 play on the hole of the asp, and the
weaned <13 <13 put his hand on the cockatrice’s den.

30:15 They <13 not hurt nor <136 in all my holy mountain; for the
<209 <14 be full of the <406 of the Lord as the waters cover
the sea.

30:16 <1033 the <1322 of all <868 <26 be made known; yea,
all <11 <8 be made known unto the <1227 of men.

30:17 There is <4855 <369 is <5401 save it <21 be revealed; <548
is no work of <424 save it <12 be made manifest in the light; and
<18 is <29 <29 is <578 upon the <85 save it <20 be
loosed.

30:18 <75 all <64 <19 have been <4264 unto the <64
of men <21 at that day be <56 and Satan <8 have <1797 over
the <2272 of the <21 of men no more, for a long time. And now, my
<808 <808 I make an end of my sayings.

2 <832 <832 31

31:1 And now I, <821 make an end of my prophesying unto you, my
<34 brethren. And I <1221 <1013 but a few <2851 <84 I know
must <3202 come to <6154 <1186 can I <17 but a few of the <682 of
my brother Jacob.

31:2 <115 the <115 <31 I have <718 sufficeth me, save it
be a few <25 <13 I must <895 <682 the doctrine of <543
<653 I <122 <10 unto you plainly, <1157 to the plainness
of my prophesying.

31:3 For my soul delighteth in plainness; for <778 this <4936 doth
the Lord God work <442 the <148 of men. For the Lord God <3146
<5308 unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men <48 to
<359 language, unto <3 understanding.

31:4 <93 I <833 that ye <962 <998 that I have <822 unto
you <87 that prophet <94 the Lord showed unto me, that <19
baptize the Lamb of God, <14 <8 take away the sins of the world.

31:5 And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, <22 have need to be
baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more
need have we, <24 unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!

31:6 And now, I <90 ask of you, my <228 <262 wherein the Lamb
of God did <42 all <546 in <34 <51 by water?

31:7 Know ye not that he was holy? But <2086 he <18 <76
he showeth unto the <165 of men that, <151 to the <2145 he
humbleth <6282 <2451 the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that
he <66 be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.

31:8 <171 <213 he was <64 with water the Holy Ghost
descended upon him in the form of a dove.

31:9 And <4145 it <66 unto the <66 of men the straightness of
the path, and the narrowness of the <3675 by <186 they <165 enter,
he having set the example <80 <609

31:10 And he said unto the <37 of men: Follow thou me. <73
my <150 <150 can we follow <954 save we <320 be willing to
keep the <1198 of the Father?

31:11 And the <118 said: Repent ye, <1128 ye, and be <105 in the
name of my Beloved Son.

31:12 And <2124 the <6220 of the Son came unto me, <4500 He that is
<28 in my <3702 to him will the <44 give the Holy <3491 like
unto me; <392 <75 me, and do the <422 <115 ye have seen me
do.

31:13 <99 my <98 <98 I know that if ye <97 <27
the Son, with full purpose of <3142 acting no hypocrisy and no
deception <142 God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins,
witnessing unto the <67 that ye are <130 to take upon you the
name of <1097 by baptism—yea, by following your Lord and your Savior
down into the <348 <272 to his <3886 <1317 then <65 ye
<1886 the Holy <6544 yea, then <911 the baptism of fire and of the
Holy <13 and then can ye <505 with the tongue of angels, and shout
praises unto the Holy One of <1295

31:14 But, <47 my <119 <119 thus came the <173 of the Son
unto me, <173 <6535 ye have repented of your <105 and witnessed
unto the <106 that ye are <106 to keep my commandments, by the
<73 of <93 and have <2631 the <7 of fire and of the Holy
<196 and can <78 with a new <6637 yea, even with the <84 of
<85 and <361 this <316 deny me, it <381 have been better for
you that ye had not <816 me.

31:15 And I heard a <91 from the <414 <88 Yea, the <645 of my
<284 are true and faithful. He that endureth to the end, the same
<168 be saved.

31:16 And now, my <131 <131 I know by this that unless a man
<21 endure to the end, in <212 the <388 of the Son of the
living God, he <751 be <39

31:17 <288 do the <303 <303 I have told you I have seen that
your Lord and your <3772 <115 do; for, for this <1134 have they
been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by <35 ye <22
enter. For the gate by <9 ye <9 enter is repentance and <178
by water; and then <266 a remission of your sins by fire and by the
Holy <2683

31:18 And then are ye in this strait and narrow path <41 leads to
eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done
<327 to the <479 of the <255 and the Son; and ye have
<246 the Holy <239 <36 <4721 of the <16 and the Son,
unto the fulfilling of the promise <15 he hath made, that if ye
<50 in by the way ye <104 receive.

31:19 And now, my <199 <199 <263 ye have gotten into this
<87 and <87 <597 I <269 ask if all is done? <3919 I say unto
you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of
<1426 with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of
him who is <6962 to save.

31:20 <228 ye must press forward with a steadfastness in <472
<647 a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.
<27 if ye <283 <28 forward, feasting upon the word of <29
and <293 to the end, <442 thus <2625 the Father: Ye <21 have
<189 life.

31:21 And now, <17 my <129 <129 this is the way; and <1157
is none <2106 way nor name <2923 under heaven whereby man can be <3889
in the <3457 of God. And now, <33 this is the <1029 of <63
and the only and true <9 of the <407 and of the Son, and of
the Holy <225 <210 is one God, <6463 end. Amen.

2 <1144 <1144 32

32:1 And now, <47 my <80 <80 I <1921 that ye ponder
<1840 in your <1195 <1001 that <36 ye <234 do <225 ye
have <246 in by the way. But, <30 why do ye <26 <2640 <403
in your hearts?

32:2 Do ye not <1043 that I said unto you that <35 ye had <307
the Holy <883 ye could <547 with the <541 of angels? And now, how
<11 ye <12 with the <12 of angels save it were by the Holy
Ghost?

32:3 Angels <19 by the <1285 of the Holy <668 <780 they <10
the <543 of Christ. <227 I said unto you, feast upon the <11
of <1193 for <95 the <7 of <294 will tell you all <98
what ye <120 do.

32:4 <32 now <91 I have <1140 <115 <4144 if ye <531
understand them it will be <2089 ye ask not, <1278 do ye knock;
<66 ye are not <4679 into the <7407 but must perish in the
<4071

32:5 For <65 <1990 I say unto you that if ye will <519 in by the
way, and <788 the Holy <231 it will show unto you all <83 what
ye <83 do.

32:6 <414 this is the <265 of <274 and <306 will be no more
<10 <305 <2577 <98 he <337 <1481 <1103 unto you in the
flesh. And when he <12 <12 <12 unto you in the flesh, the
<51 <253 he <13 say unto you <4 ye observe to do.

32:7 And now I, <1430 <134 say <3331 the <4621 stoppeth mine
utterance, and I am left to mourn <142 of the <7351 and the
<4065 and the ignorance, and the stiffneckedness of men; for they
will not search knowledge, nor <171 <1805 <4 when it is
<92 unto them in plainness, even as <6446 as word can be.

32:8 And now, my <351 <351 I perceive that ye <325 still in
your hearts; and it <7555 me that I must <266 <359 this
thing. For if ye <573 <3379 unto the <92 <116 teacheth a man to
pray ye <13 know that ye must pray; for the evil <4769 <17 not
a man to pray, but <8 him that he must not pray.

32:9 But <233 I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not
faint; that ye must not perform any <4072 unto the Lord save in the
first <3737 ye <179 pray unto the <699 in the name of <230 that
he will consecrate thy performance unto <3290 that thy <5 may
be for the <6790 of thy <7670

2 <498 <498 33

33:1 And now I, <212 <212 <1611 all the <236 <120 were <4223
<1542 my <7800 <347 am I <664 in writing, like unto speaking;
for when a man <1542 by the <430 of the Holy <471 the <6 of the
Holy <7 carrieth it unto the <532 of the <1311 of men.

33:2 But <133 <322 are many that harden <1569 <18 <2582 the
Holy Spirit, that it hath no <121 in <2298 <406 they cast many
<77 away <78 are <1673 and esteem them as <9 of <5042

33:3 But I, <100 have <16 what I have <7585 and I <21 it as
of <285 worth, and <4903 unto my <2203 For I pray continually
for them by day, and mine eyes <1456 my pillow by night, <334 of
<65 and I cry unto my God in faith, and I know that he will hear my
cry.

33:4 And I know that the Lord God will <203 my <7649 for the
gain of my <61 And the <556 <101 I have <86 in weakness will
be made <6486 unto <56 for it persuadeth them to do good; it <3710
<1158 unto them of <149 fathers; and it <189 of Jesus, and
<21 them to <2316 in him, and to <829 to the end, <48 is
life eternal.

33:5 And it <28 harshly <181 sin, <1010 to the <1808 of
the truth; <179 no man will be <3936 at the <80 <32 I have
<81 save he <317 be of the <373 of the devil.

33:6 I <5935 in <1830 I <4 in <36 I <4 in my <78 for
he hath <5239 my soul from <4193

33:7 I have <7071 for my <2274 and <203 <979 in <690 that I
<52 meet many souls spotless at his judgment-seat.

33:8 I have <26 for the Jew—I say Jew, <206 I mean them from
<4140 I came.

33:9 I also have <22 for the <2684 But <308 for none of
<719 can I hope <2816 they <52 be reconciled unto <416 and <681
into the <1081 <1672 and walk in the <1089 path <129 <1174 to life,
and continue in the path <660 the end of the day of probation.

33:10 And now, my <565 <565 and also Jew, and all ye ends of
the <3704 <550 unto <64 <171 and <213 in <815 and if ye
<7 not in <13 <13 <5 in <839 And if ye <79 <7
in <139 ye will <6 in <17 <813 for they are the <22 of
<93 and he hath <642 them unto me; and they <4908 all men that
they <767 do <4427

33:11 And if they are not the <32 of <31 <2538 ye—for <48 will
show unto you, with <478 and <199 glory, that they are his <57 at
the last day; and you and I <77 <4339 face to face <1668 his bar;
and ye <11 know that I have been <6019 of him to <551 <90
<2178 <1931 my weakness.

33:12 And I pray the <609 in the name of <66 that many of us, if
not all, may be <1139 in his <1138 at that <74 and last day.

33:13 And now, my <182 <182 all <3626 who are of the <3119 of
<3119 and all ye ends of the <188 I <748 unto you as the <1566 of
one crying from the dust: Farewell <231 that <47 day <96 come.

33:14 And you that will not <7237 of the goodness of God, and respect
the <158 of the <3797 and also my <145 and the <10 <277 <33
<3878 <2950 out of the <3969 of the Lamb of God, <320 I bid you an
<4670 farewell, for <140 <25 <24 condemn you at the last
day.

33:15 For what I seal on <94 <18 be <1041 <471 you at the
judgment bar; for thus hath the Lord <180 me, and I must obey.

 THE BOOK OF JACOB

THE BROTHER OF NEPHI

The <67 of his preaching unto his <2398 He confoundeth a man who
seeketh to overthrow the <1037 of <330 A few <22 <911 the
history of the <2839 of Nephi.

<5727 <807 1

1:1 For <120 it came to pass that fifty and five years had <8613
away from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; <570 <837 gave me,
<5714 a <7619 <49 the small plates, upon <168 <146
<751 are engraven.

1:2 And he gave me, <22 a <22 that I <369 <306 upon <21
plates a few of the <26 <30 I consider to be most precious; that I
<21 not touch, save it were lightly, <52 the <100 of this
<101 <24 are called the <5 of <106

1:3 For he said that the <21 of his <15 <34 be engraven upon
his <1485 <83 and that I <11 <6363 <65 <64 and hand them
down unto my <5718 from generation to generation.

1:4 And if <888 were <183 <56 was sacred, or <7002 <5
was great, or prophesying, that I <38 <48 the heads of them
upon <44 <51 and touch upon them as much as it were possible, for
Christ’s sake, and for the sake of our <811

1:5 For <654 of <682 and <365 anxiety, it truly had been made
<1250 unto us <127 our <700 what <149 <56 happen unto
<2294

1:6 And we also had many revelations, and the <759 of much prophecy;
<214 we knew of <471 and his kingdom, <94 <31 <410

1:7 <4028 we labored diligently <1049 our <46 that we <1899
<7968 them to come unto <567 and <423 of the <423 of God,
that they <18 <701 into his rest, lest by any means he <43 swear
in his wrath they <7 not <18 in, as in the provocation in the
days of temptation <6223 the <1066 of <3700 were in the wilderness.

1:8 <1481 we <1234 to God that we <1557 <68 all men not to
rebel <424 God, to provoke him to <5118 but that all men <24
<692 in <85 and view his <4981 and <3622 his cross and bear
the shame of the <7987 <133 I, <322 take it upon me to <2575
the <329 of my <2786 <289

1:9 Now <367 began to be old, and he saw that he must soon die;
<35 he anointed a man to be a king and a ruler over his <310
now, <977 to the reigns of the kings.

1:10 The <15 <1868 loved <46 exceedingly, he <5 been a <244
protector for <3395 <8 wielded the sword of Laban in <1046 defence,
and <11 <206 in all his days for <11 welfare—

1:11 <149 the <40 were desirous to retain in remembrance his
name. And <7932 <190 reign in his stead were <400 by the <237
<4649 <1201 third <2 and so <3614 <82 to the <82 of the
kings; and thus they were <24 by the <24 let them be of whatever
name they would.

1:12 And it came to pass that <102 died.

1:13 Now the <73 <303 were not Lamanites were Nephites;
<4800 they were <42 <3979 Jacobites, Josephites,
Zoramites, Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites.

1:14 But I, <202 <664 not hereafter distinguish them by <414 names,
but I <11 call them <38 that seek to <3209 the <48 of
<98 and <799 who are friendly to <66 I <21 call <50 or
the <18 of <17 <112 to the <112 of the <194

1:15 And now it came to pass that the <22 of <22 <2002 the <153
of the <147 king, <254 to grow hard in <185 <5641 and indulge
<8292 <1949 in <3408 practices, such as like unto David of old
desiring many wives and concubines, and also Solomon, his son.

1:16 Yea, and they also <41 to <1667 much gold and silver, and <8
to be <5825 up <44 in pride.

1:17 <456 I, <136 gave unto them <133 <734 as I <1513 them in
the temple, <265 <1576 <4592 mine errand from the Lord.

1:18 For I, <28 and my <357 Joseph had been consecrated <6239
and teachers of this <233 by the hand of <372

1:19 And we did magnify our office unto the <3867 taking upon us the
responsibility, answering the sins of the <147 upon our own <624 if
we did not <1112 them the word of God with all diligence; <396 by
laboring with our <528 <157 <5991 <3 not come upon our garments;
otherwise <10 <10 <471 come upon our garments, and we <7 not be
found <1307 at the last day.

<846 <846 2

2:1 The <133 <301 <112 the <111 of <217 <9335 unto the <76
of <7 <1920 the death of Nephi:

2:2 Now, my <1075 <1075 I, <26 <261 to the responsibility
<33 I am <247 to God, to <124 mine <124 with soberness, and
that I <88 rid my garments of your <2724 I come up into the temple
this day that I <18 declare unto you the word of God.

2:3 And ye <8051 know that I have hitherto been diligent in the
<50 of my calling; but I this day am weighed down with much more
desire and anxiety for the <1782 of your <1440 than I have <33
been.

2:4 For <974 as yet, ye have been <3125 unto the word of the
<219 <108 I have <1319 unto you.

2:5 But <25 <1373 ye unto me, and know that by the help of the
all-powerful Creator of <2381 and <3542 I can tell you <815 your
thoughts, how that ye are <8017 to <8569 in sin, <48 sin
appeareth very <5882 unto me, yea, and <5 unto God.

2:6 Yea, it <1992 my soul and causeth me to shrink with <700 <1333
the presence of my Maker, that I must <7746 unto you <55 the
<5945 of your hearts.

2:7 And also it <37 me that I must use so much boldness of <9293
<26 you, <41 your <439 and your <6823 many of whose
feelings are exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate <18 God,
<91 <1989 is pleasing unto God;

2:8 And it supposeth me that they have come up <7635 to hear the
<21 word of God, yea, the word <31 healeth the wounded <1982

2:9 <697 it burdeneth my soul that I <690 be constrained,
<985 of the strict <803 <25 I have <2432 from God, to
admonish you <318 to your crimes, to enlarge the wounds of <604
who are already wounded, instead of consoling and healing <397 wounds;
and <15 who have not been <15 <15 of <2638 upon the
<78 word of God have daggers placed to pierce <25 <277 and
wound <5 <121 minds.

2:10 But, <1499 the <9288 of the task, I must do
<68 to the <83 commands of God, and tell you <167 your
<193 and <6333 in the <211 of the pure in <3228 and
the broken <5 and <408 the glance of the piercing eye of the
Almighty God.

2:11 <140 I must tell you the <5788 <53 to the <1871 of
the word of God. For <326 as I inquired of the <344 thus came the
word unto me, <3080 <466 get thou up into the <438 on the morrow,
and <437 the word <172 I <752 give thee unto this <1175

2:12 And now <44 my <499 this is the word <21 I <26 unto
you, that many of you have begun to <702 for gold, and for <703
and for all <3743 of precious ores, in the <29 this land, <3 is a
land of <2949 unto you and to your <1290 doth abound most
plentifully.

2:13 And the hand of providence hath smiled upon you most pleasingly,
that you have <721 many riches; and <271 some of you have
<10 more abundantly than that of your <9817 ye are <768 up in
the <6464 of your <823 and wear <6547 <6547 and high <696 <32
of the costliness of your apparel, and <6584 your <30 <12
ye <2795 that ye are <3263 than they.

2:14 And now, my <139 do ye <17 that God justifieth you in
this thing? <2599 I say unto you, Nay. But he condemneth you, and if
ye persist in <826 <1327 his judgments must <4334 come unto you.

2:15 O that he <729 show you that he can <323 you, and with one
<273 of his eye he can <4393 you to the dust!

2:16 O that he <30 rid you from this <6475 and abomination. And, O
that ye <13 listen unto the word of his commands, and let not this
<140 of your <2354 <1023 your souls!

2:17 Think of your <132 like unto yourselves, and be <9850 with
all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you.

2:18 But <528 ye seek for riches, seek ye for the <1879 of God.

2:19 And <809 ye have <217 a hope in <1437 ye <321 obtain
<25 if ye seek <2293 and ye will seek them for the intent to do
good—to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the
captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.

2:20 And now, my <218 I have <2886 unto you <463 pride; and
<521 of you <333 have afflicted your neighbor, and persecuted him
<257 ye were proud in your <283 of the <220 <19 God hath
<773 you, what say ye of it?

2:21 Do ye not <265 that such <22 are <737 unto him who
<5622 all flesh? And the one <3971 is as <396 in his sight as the
other. And all <3970 is of the dust; and for the selfsame end hath he
<32 <1376 that they <650 keep his <3391 and glorify him
<5126

2:22 And now I make an end of speaking unto you <113 this <1148
And were it not that I must <2042 unto you <14 a grosser crime,
my heart <271 <7704 <752 <121 of you.

2:23 But the word of God burdens me <14 of your <25 crimes. For
<523 thus <3293 the Lord: This <1042 <4812 to wax in iniquity; they
<2883 not the scriptures, for they seek to excuse <1261 in
<7232 <6896 <35 of the <142 <164 were <2462
<67 David, and Solomon his son.

2:24 <416 <1276 and <10 <1742 had many <837 and <1276
<25 <822 was <169 <301 me, <61 the <1228

2:25 <655 thus <9 the <635 I have led this <73 <2102 out
of the land of <5030 by the <2273 of mine arm, that I <1074 raise
up unto me a <5250 branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.

2:26 <47 I the Lord God will not <1659 that this <48 <342
do like unto them of old.

2:27 <23 my <306 hear me, and <1038 to the word of the
<149 For <1906 <28 not any man <1798 you have save it be one wife;
and concubines he <16 have none;

2:28 For I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women. And
whoredoms are an abomination <135 me; thus <127 the Lord of <6306

2:29 <68 this <83 <39 keep my <3914 <16 the Lord
of <8092 or <6043 be the land for <876 sakes.

2:30 For if I will, <22 the Lord of <21 <145 up seed unto me, I
will <5725 my <2937 <1330 they <44 <110 unto <612 things.

2:31 For <265 I, the <194 have seen the sorrow, and <3913 the
mourning of the daughters of my <73 in the land of <201 yea,
and in all the <5536 of my <1440 <271 of the <920 and
<7059 of <80 husbands.

2:32 And I will not suffer, <81 the Lord of <81 that the cries of
the fair <50 of this <35 <277 I have led out of the land of
<56 <90 come up unto me <1906 the men of my <22 <38
the Lord of <158

2:33 For they <23 not lead away captive the <44 of my <94
<80 of <74 tenderness, save I <17 <7181 them with a sore curse,
even unto <10837 for they <13 not <7270 <374 like unto
them of old, <52 the Lord of <51

2:34 And now <154 my <279 ye know that <167 <491 were
<557 to our <6440 Lehi; <1527 ye have <2926 them before; and ye
have come unto <1897 condemnation; for ye have done <27 <422 <120
ye ought not to have done.

2:35 <420 ye have done greater <9798 than the <1804 our
<2406 Ye have <1084 the <761 of your <1258 wives, and lost the
confidence of your <1275 <116 of your bad examples <304 <708
and the sobbings of <126 <26 ascend up to God <163 you. And
<22 of the strictness of the word of God, <72 <4032 down <16
you, many <25 died, pierced with deep wounds.

<1596 <1596 3

3:1 But <131 I, <1104 <577 <588 unto you that are pure in heart.
Look unto God with firmness of mind, and pray unto him with exceeding
<3125 and he will console you in your afflictions, and he will plead
your cause, and send down justice upon <752 who seek your destruction.

3:2 O all ye that are pure in <1217 lift up your <1030 and <3609 the
<1286 word of God, and <3707 upon his love; for ye may, if your
minds are firm, <701

3:3 But, wo, wo, unto you that are not pure in <42 that are filthy
this day <163 God; for <2989 ye <4589 the land is <450 for your
sakes; and the <205 <154 are not <24 like unto you,
nevertheless they are <19 with a sore cursing, <298 scourge you
even unto <100

3:4 And the time <1059 cometh, that <47 ye <47 they <21
possess the land of your inheritance, and the Lord God will lead away
the <631 out from <577 you.

3:5 <277 the <2050 your <326 whom ye hate <234 of <246
filthiness and the cursing <79 hath come upon <10 skins, are more
<34 than you; for they have not <6563 the <1487 of the
<513 <23 was <355 unto our father—that they <857 have save it
were one wife, and <628 they <11 have none, and <649 <5
not be <617 committed <74 <2487

3:6 And now, this <43 they <3741 to keep; <391 <75
of this observance, in <4865 this commandment, the Lord God will not
<1119 <913 but will be <6981 unto <347 and one day they <136
<5638 a <7124 <1388

3:7 <120 <101 husbands love <3 <382 and <3 <818 love <3
husbands; and <4 <13 and <3 <10 love <3 children; and
<4 <10848 and <3 hatred <8886 you is <69 of the <1201
of <11 <3386 <78 how much <1298 are you than they, in the
<1006 of your <471 Creator?

3:8 O my <178 I fear that <4524 ye <78 <217 of your sins that
<37 skins will be whiter than yours, when ye <16 be <2930 with
them <290 the <7454 of God.

3:9 <754 a <144 I give unto you, <187 is the word of God,
that ye <7798 no more <452 them <88 of the <5422 of <50
skins; <3675 <45 ye <16 <14 them <14 of <11
filthiness; but ye <12 <4153 your own filthiness, and <5
that <14 <259 came <19 of <5 <5910

3:10 <62 ye <22 <17 your <535 how that ye have
grieved <18 <504 <22 of the <4624 that ye have set <93
<200 and <4953 <24 that ye may, <17 of your <50 <5811
your <2644 unto <11451 and <30 sins be heaped upon your
<455 at the last day.

3:11 O my <159 <829 unto my <6584 arouse the faculties of your
souls; shake <2061 that ye may awake from the slumber of death;
and loose <13 from the <6972 of hell that ye may not <265
<4236 to the <7637 to be cast into that lake of fire and brimstone
<168 is the <2390 death.

3:12 And now I, <597 <2189 many more <700 unto the <779 of <2191
warning them <167 fornication and lasciviousness, and <6588 kind of
sin, telling them the <7715 consequences of <366

3:13 And a hundredth part of the proceedings of this <837 <56 now
<2395 to be numerous, <3896 be <1168 upon <752 plates; but many of
<144 <22 are <11 upon the larger <2943 and <9 wars,
and <4 contentions, and the <2502 of <6 <2502

3:14 These <3006 are <2574 the <4 of <93 and they were made by
the hand of <2389 And I make an end of <1307 <56 words.

<723 <723 4

4:1 Now <723 it came to pass that I, <38 <2451 ministered much
unto my <131 in <5072 (and I <92 <3131 but a <5878 of my <3329
<246 of the difficulty of engraving our <2354 upon plates) and we
know that the <164 <125 we <27 upon <82 must remain;

4:2 But whatsoever <14 we <13 upon <11097 save it be upon <18
must <4359 and vanish away; but we can <17 a few <45 upon <138
<39 will give our <332 and also our <2386 <282 a <3229
degree of <5867 <1337 us, or <3 <148 fathers—

4:3 Now in this <1328 we do <6271 and we <2251 <3032 to
<3130 <137 <45 upon <45 hoping that our <39 <1673 and
our <347 will <791 them with thankful <1551 and look upon them
that they may <7672 with joy and not with <1158 <440 with
contempt, <59 <59 <2606 parents.

4:4 For, for this <1645 have we <236 <53 <3592 that they may
know that we knew of <3002 and we had a hope of his <3873 many
hundred <3356 <428 his coming; and not only we ourselves had a hope
of his <3668 but also all the holy prophets <138 were <23 us.

4:5 <640 they believed in <1723 and worshiped the <3640 in his
<5401 and also we worship the <10 in his <2935 And for this <82
we keep the law of Moses, it pointing our <2192 to him; and for this
<5088 it is sanctified unto us for <5684 even as it was
accounted unto <6755 in the wilderness to be <2479 unto the
<2198 of God in offering up his son Isaac, <85 is a similitude of
God and his Only Begotten Son.

4:6 <572 we <2101 the prophets, and we have many revelations and
the <3271 of <3270 and <332 all <165 <5056 we <1831 a
<4943 and our <3321 becometh unshaken, insomuch that we <1580 can
<1383 in the name of <5583 and the very trees obey us, or the
mountains, or the waves of the sea.

4:7 Nevertheless, the Lord God <5662 us our <4173 that we may know
that it is by his grace, and his <763 condescensions unto the <275
of men, that we have <1601 to do <79 <1436

4:8 <197 <21 and <7778 are the <8794 of the <1644 How
unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is
impossible that man <923 find out all his ways. And no man <9642 of
his ways save it be <6144 unto him; <845 <383 despise not
the <149 of God.

4:9 For <489 by the <74 of his word man came upon the face of the
<3761 <198 <2653 was <1853 by the <19 of his word. <192 if
God <1890 able to <1241 and the <9883 was, and to <7 and man was
created, O <5938 why not able to <181 the <39 or the workmanship
of his hands upon the face of it, <2407 to his will and pleasure?

4:10 <51 <91 seek not to <9770 the <1065 but to take
<7 from his hand. For <94 ye <748 know that he
counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in <170 mercy, over all his
<9743

4:11 <43 <479 <44 be <4205 unto him through the
atonement of <433 his Only <307 Son, and ye may <284 a
resurrection, <77 to the <125 of the resurrection <135 is in
<23 and be presented as the first-fruits of <418 unto God, <315
<1353 and <2152 a good hope of <468 in him <443 he <12276
<4880 in the <4889

4:12 And now, beloved, marvel not that I tell you <267 <11305 for why
not <165 of the <78 of <55 and attain to a <5302 <606
of him, as to <10 to the <9 of a <78 and the <195
to come?

4:13 <301 my <119 he that prophesieth, let him <7036 to the
<9961 of men; for the <4830 <4472 the <2600 and lieth not.
<144 it <9 of <699 as they really are, and of <7 as
they <8 will be; <296 <84 <9 are manifested unto us
<6310 for the <7901 of our souls. But <204 we are not
<449 alone in <23 <107 for God also <923 them unto <582
of old.

4:14 But <25 the Jews were a stiffnecked <1839 and they despised
the <699 of <4957 and killed the <503 and <7916 for <61
that they <3675 not understand. <88 <814 of <681 blindness,
<207 blindness came by looking beyond the mark, they must <8821 fall;
for God hath <8358 away his <2714 from <1299 and <10174 unto
them many <41 <29 they <859 understand, <38 they desired it.
And <6 they <6 it God hath done it, that they may stumble.

4:15 And now I, <898 am led on by the <166 unto prophesying; for I
<5030 by the workings of the <12 <48 is in me, that by the
<12129 of the Jews they will reject the stone upon <18 they <2121
build and have safe foundation.

4:16 But <144 <324 to the <2216 this <22 <1210 <1117
the <3980 and the last, and the only sure foundation, upon <35 the
Jews can build.

4:17 And now, my <309 how is it possible that these, <2493 <343
<10520 the sure <28 can ever <60 upon it, that it may
<49 the head of <173 corner?

4:18 <295 my <415 <296 I will unfold this mystery unto you;
if I do not, by any means, get shaken from my <1752 in the <4950
and stumble <167 of my over <3266 for you.

<1071 <1071 5

5:1 <47 my <46 do ye not <1298 to have read the <257 of
the <6539 Zenos, <110 he <289 unto the <4453 of <4452 <2921

5:2 Hearken, O ye <11 of <11 and hear the <28 of me, a <28
of the <681

5:3 For <167 thus <1990 the <554 I will liken <5128 O <30 of
<31 like unto a tame olive-tree, <55 a man took and nourished in
his vineyard; and it grew, and waxed old, and <1236 to decay.

5:4 And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard went <3842 and
he saw that his olive-tree <27 to decay; and he <6388 I will prune
it, and dig <7223 it, and nourish it, that perhaps it may shoot <2402
<7048 and <2001 branches, and it <1147 not.

5:5 And it came to pass that he pruned it, and digged <35 it, and
<91 it <283 to his <729

5:6 And it came to pass that <257 many days it <72 to put <52
<3729 a <9736 <55 and <55 branches; but <148 the main top
<10839 <19 to <9326

5:7 And it came to pass that the <118 of the <118 saw it, and he
said unto his servant: It <3378 me that I <854 lose this tree;
<543 go and pluck the branches from a wild <182 and <1539
them <3347 unto me; and we will <17 off <2011 main <19 <197
are <3476 to wither <7975 and we will cast them into the fire that
they may be burned.

5:8 And <94 <241 the Lord of the vineyard, I take away many of
<583 <113 and <113 <168 and I will graft them whithersoever I
will; and it mattereth not that if it so be that the root of this tree
will <10633 I may <4457 the <2580 <139 unto myself; <104 I
will take <45 <45 and <45 <45 and I will <45 them
<46 I will.

5:9 Take thou the <106 of the wild <125 and <19 them in,
in the <4133 thereof; and <36 <121 I have plucked off I will cast
into the fire and burn <606 that they may not cumber the <9822 of my
vineyard.

5:10 And it came to pass that the servant of the Lord of the <209
did <266 to the word of the Lord of the <144 and grafted in
the <77 of the wild olive-tree.

5:11 And the Lord of the <32 <8295 that it <230 be <308
<13036 and pruned, and nourished, saying unto his <248 It <248
me that I <19 lose this <249 <144 that <359 I <622
<156 the roots <156 that they <357 not, that I <12 <11
them unto myself, I have done this <5681

5:12 <752 go thy way; <10559 the tree, and <399 it, <97
to my <1619

5:13 And <154 will I <5512 in the nethermost part of my <108
<191 I <2664 it <235 not unto thee; and I do it that I
may <62 unto myself the natural <125 of the <88 and <1874
that I may lay up <244 <88 <1771 the season, unto <247 for it
<115 me that I <114 lose this tree and the <20 <9664

5:14 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <159 went his way,
and hid the <57 <57 of the tame <522 in the <91
parts of the <92 some in one and some in <10376 <120 to
his will and <8563

5:15 And it came to pass that a long time <4897 <399 and the Lord of
the <57 said unto his <204 Come, let us go down into the
<49 that we may <1649 in the <286

5:16 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <22 and also the
servant, went down into the <45 to labor. And it came to pass that
the <310 said unto his master: <742 look here; <10419 the tree.

5:17 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <36 looked and
beheld the tree in the <381 the wild olive <142 had been grafted;
and it had sprung <593 and <3634 to bear fruit. And he <26 that it
was <5633 and the <192 <212 was like unto the <174 <18

5:18 And he said unto the <132 <76 the <45 of the wild
tree have <1034 hold of the moisture of the root thereof, that the root
<39 hath <2236 <59 much strength; and <864 of the much
strength of the root <16 the wild <39 have <19 <19 tame
<58 Now, if we had not <424 in <330 <517 the tree <21
<2669 have perished. And now, <589 I <993 lay up much fruit, <120
the tree <18 hath <36 <11964 and the <101 <7 I <18 lay
up <318 the <318 unto mine own self.

5:19 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <167 said unto the
<117 <249 let us go to the <301 part of the <229 and
<203 if the <145 <93 of the tree have not <61 <97 much
<61 <382 that I may lay up of the <9 <70 <65 the <65
unto mine own <66

5:20 And it came to pass that they went <34 whither the <775 had
hid the <50 <50 of the <476 and he said unto the <77
<12930 these; and he <225 the <1925 that it had <65 <31 much
fruit; and he <13 also that it was <5584 And he said unto the
<31 Take of the <75 <212 and lay it up <79 the <79
that I may <488 it unto mine own self; for <182 said he, this
long time have I <907 it, and it hath <57 <57 much <218

5:21 And it came to pass that the <358 said unto his <358 How
comest thou <846 to plant this <103 or this <3350 of the tree? For
<51 it was the poorest spot in all the land of thy <428

5:22 And the Lord of the <210 said unto him: Counsel me not; I knew
that it was a poor spot of <13585 <665 I said unto <1100 I have
<90 it this long time, and thou beholdest that it hath <96
<97 much <97

5:23 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <56 said unto his
<158 Look hither; <255 I have planted another <97 of the tree
also; and thou knowest that this spot of <810 was poorer than the
first. But, <26 the <484 I have <69 it this long <69 and it
hath <67 <66 much <219 therefore, <8394 it, and lay it up
<203 the <203 that I may <202 it unto mine own <286

5:24 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <86 said <6631 unto
his <87 Look hither, and <62 <85 <85 <331 <404 I have
planted; <9 that I have <70 it <12 and it hath <67
<68 <133

5:25 And he said unto the <36 Look <221 and <27 the last.
<513 this have I <129 in a good spot of <185 and I have
<42 it this long <112 and only a part of the tree hath <49
<49 tame <473 and the <5487 part of the tree hath <13 <12
wild <130 <260 I have <34 this tree like unto the others.

5:26 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <120 said unto the
<83 Pluck off the <408 that have not <42 <42 good <54
and cast them into the <8408

5:27 But <53 the <337 said unto him: Let us <1314 it, and dig
<1279 it, and <915 it a <2496 longer, that <958 it may <1200
<42 good <413 unto <300 that thou canst lay it up <213 the
season.

5:28 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <85 and the <57
of the Lord of the <10 did <52 all the <42 of the <375

5:29 And it came to pass that a long time had <846 <846 and the Lord
of the <31 said unto his <125 <597 let us go down into the
<595 that we may <846 <262 in the <44 For <120 the time
draweth near, and the end soon cometh; <404 I must lay up <65
<100 the <313 unto mine own <308

5:30 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <62 and the <103
went down into the <1517 and they came to the tree <4726 <605
<198 had been <3474 off, and the wild <8 had been <748
in; and <296 all sorts of <61 did <1220 the <400

5:31 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <57 did taste of the
<235 <2829 sort <1002 to its number. And the Lord of the <18
<1545 <336 this long time have we <293 this <567 and I have
laid up unto <1110 <116 the season much <375

5:32 But <144 this time it hath <285 <243 much <50 and <3243
is none of it <415 is <677 And <20 <11 are all kinds of bad
<346 and it profiteth me nothing, <4712 all our labor; and
now it <1138 me that I <1138 lose this <112

5:33 And the Lord of the <89 said unto the <226 What <855 we
do unto the <90 that I may <508 <225 good <145 <801 unto
mine own self?

5:34 And the <193 said unto his <690 <123 <944 thou didst
<1415 in the <182 of the wild <1165 they have <132 the
roots, that they are alive and they have not perished; <12396 thou
<649 that they are yet <114

5:35 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <88 said unto his
<89 The tree <124 me <124 and the <1354 <82 profit me
<8624 so long as it <105 <410 <166 evil <180

5:36 <2557 I know that the <24 are <11038 and for mine own
<8067 I have preserved <3185 and <101 of <1947 much <1044 they
have <5169 <202 <1794 from the wild <1032 good <40

5:37 But <200 the wild <119 have grown and have overrun the
<47 <1539 and <36 that the wild <15 have overcome the
<12 <83 it hath <40 <76 much evil <223 and <19 that
it hath <11 <11 so much evil <185 thou <138 that it
beginneth to <9434 and it will soon <2027 ripened, that it may be
cast into the fire, <3611 we <243 do something for it to <220
it.

5:38 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <165 said unto his
<165 Let us go down into the <1077 <1377 of the <482 and
<402 if the <422 <97 have also <80 <80 evil <127

5:39 And it came to pass that they went down into the <33 <33
of the <508 And it came to pass that they <1034 that the <110 of
the <43 <43 had <104 corrupt <863 yea, the <1060 and the
<3286 and also the last; and they had all <18 corrupt.

5:40 And the wild <34 of the last had <172 that part of the tree
<403 <82 <82 good <415 even that the <828 had withered away
and <5824

5:41 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <136 wept, and said
unto the <138 What <2383 I have done more for my vineyard?

5:42 <373 I knew that all the <68 of the <150 save it were
<2251 had <87 <11570 And now <1310 <71 have once <73
<74 good <22 have also <15 corrupted; and now all the <2901 of
my <62 are good for <349 save it be to be hewn down and cast
into the <797

5:43 And <202 this <2329 <625 <110 hath <110 <714 I did <1131
in a good spot of <903 yea, even that <64 was choice unto me <10298
all <890 <205 of the land of my <207

5:44 And thou beheldest that I also cut down that <29 cumbered this
spot of <14760 that I <1778 <50 this tree in the <1906 <1684

5:45 And thou <30 that a part <366 <118 <117 good <191
and a part <9 <9 <9 wild <372 and <372 I <1928 not
the <253 <13 and cast them into the <352 <419 they have
<231 the good <109 that it hath <111 away.

5:46 And now, <19 <625 all the care <80 we have <1533
of my <192 the <166 <41 have <175 <11739 that they
<509 <60 no good <61 and <197 I had hoped to preserve, to have
laid up <200 <25 <709 the <825 unto mine own <825 But,
<50 they have <36 like unto the wild <2032 and they are of
no <12250 but to be hewn down and cast into the fire; and it <694 me
that I <452 lose <3602

5:47 But what <293 I have done more in my <293 Have I slackened
mine hand, that I have not <657 it, Nay, I have <5 it, and
I have <2002 <1031 it, and I have <2319 it, and I have dunged it; and
I have stretched <116 mine hand almost all the day <10950 and the end
<949 nigh. And it <77 me that I <76 hew down all the <150
of my <156 and cast them into the fire that they <18 be <2242
Who is it that has corrupted my <89

5:48 And it came to pass that the <767 said unto his <767 Is it
not the loftiness of thy vineyard—have not the <243 <177
<234 the <636 <217 are good? And <259 the <12 have
<12 the <12 <1539 <360 they grew faster than the <697
of the <789 <6064 <6 unto themselves. <439 I say, is not
this the <3407 that the <97 of thy <412 have <213 corrupted?

5:49 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <18 said unto the
<490 Let us go to and hew down the <35 of the <17 and cast
them into the <326 that they <797 not <1034 the <1444 of my
<149 for I have done all. What <232 I have done more for my
<144

5:50 But, <288 the <140 said unto the Lord of the vineyard: Spare
it a <1255 longer.

5:51 And the Lord <1047 Yea, I will <9718 it a <16 <1271 for it
<218 me that I <200 lose the <84 of my <472

5:52 <2217 let us take of the <166 of <368 <175 I have
<1418 in the <705 <500 of my <91 and let us <969 them
into the tree from <7461 they came; and let us <2513 from the tree
<2516 <37 <554 <394 is most bitter, and <26 in the <722
<12 of the tree in the <509 <509

5:53 And this will I do that the tree may not <2478 <9220 perhaps, I
may <834 unto <1142 the <242 <259 for mine own purpose.

5:54 And, <148 the <13 of the <50 <49 of the tree <99 I
<98 <2297 I <1975 are yet alive; <1297 that I may
<40 them also for mine own purpose, I will take of the <31 of
this <1114 and I will <93 them in unto <450 Yea, I will <8 in
unto them the <22 of <1005 mother <22 that I may <42 the
<68 also unto mine own self, that when they <256 be sufficiently
<7766 <1470 they may <551 <435 good <143 unto me, and I may yet
have <3343 in the <12 of my <208

5:55 And it came to pass that they took from the <115 tree <112 had
<345 wild, and <1347 in unto the <12 trees, <12 also had
<13 wild.

5:56 And they also took of the <18 <257 <18 had <16 <29 and
<30 into <99 <99 <1257

5:57 And the Lord of the <359 said unto the <375 <1608 not the
wild <123 from the <52 save it be <245 <38 are most bitter;
and in them ye <120 <147 <1384 to that <14 I have said.

5:58 And we will <1555 <1284 the <67 of the <299 and we will
trim up the <47 <1142 and we will <295 from the <19 <49
<11 <37 are <1110 that must <267 and cast them into the
<870

5:59 And this I do <282 <282 the <195 <276 may take <508
<531 of <113 <14736 and <5 of the change of the <1214
that the good may <543 the evil.

5:60 And <20 that I have <1249 the <152 <63 and the
<42 <560 and that I have <155 in the <14 <14 <102
into <48 <161 <260 and have <26 the <21 of <9 <9
<10 <72 <72 the <100 of my <168 may <255 <255 <26
good <807 and that I may have joy <10 in the <255 of my <139
and, <28 that I may <5571 <5571 that I have <46 the
<47 and the <61 of the <1140 fruit—

5:61 <485 go to, and call servants, that we may <1690 <4185
with our <953 in the <44 that we may prepare the way, that I may
<73 <73 <63 the <103 <950 <180 <3 <66 is good and
the most <5706 <1016 all <1015 <1237

5:62 <52 let us go to and <49 with our <47 this last <1939
for <705 the end <792 nigh, and this is for the last time that I
<270 <1870 my <367

5:63 Graft in the <3119 <5655 at the last that they may be first,
and that the <113 may be <1106 and dig <864 the <317 both old and
young, the <15 and the <1263 and the last and the <29 that all may
be <895 once <109 for the last <10078

5:64 <96 dig <37 <2972 and <70 <3 and dung them once
<10099 for the last <100 for the end <98 <890 And if it be so that
<654 last grafts <98 grow, and <155 <155 the <151 <154 then
<10 ye <171 the way for <42 that they may grow.

5:65 And as they <114 to grow ye <22 clear away the <225 <183
<36 <36 bitter <35 <409 to the <344 of the good and the
size <391 and ye <25 not <26 away the bad <364 all at once,
lest the <262 <8 <748 be too <559 for the graft, and the
<449 <12 <27 <406 and I lose the <320 of my <188

5:66 For it <780 me that I <32 lose the <17 of my <1917
<1699 ye <30 <56 away the bad <76 as the good <9 <123
that the root and the top may be equal in strength, <7947 the good
<18 <421 the bad, and the bad be hewn down and cast into the
<903 that they <901 not the <902 of my <55 and thus will I
sweep away the bad out of my <85

5:67 And the <149 of the <182 tree will I <110 in <235 into
the <10 <3025

5:68 And the <21 of the <11 tree will I <21 into the <7
<12 of the <22 and thus will I <187 them <11575 <9978 that
they <92 <8 <195 the <21 <196 and they <8 be one.

5:69 And the bad <10 be cast <1425 yea, even out of all the land of
my <100 for <834 only this once will I <300 my <97

5:70 And it came to pass that the Lord of the <517 sent his
servant; and the <1010 went and did as the Lord had <8021 him,
and <1400 <444 servants; and they were few.

5:71 And the Lord of the <35 said unto <12638 Go to, and <454 in
the <499 with your might. For <74 this is the last time that I
<99 <703 my <88 for the end is nigh at <1308 and the <2082
<5403 <2211 and if ye <38 with your <492 with me ye <27 have
joy in the <527 <347 I <9 lay up unto <970 <1403 the time
<11 will soon <7793

5:72 And it came to pass that the servants did go and <44 with <653
mights; and the Lord of the <99 <7607 also with <1943 and they
did obey the <5757 of the Lord of the <17 in all <4497

5:73 And <2140 <3649 to be the <218 <73 <263 in the <107 and
the <9 <247 <15 to grow and thrive exceedingly; and the wild
<11 <11 to be <1564 off and to be cast <4888 and they did keep
the root and the top <414 equal, <380 to the <456 <1106

5:74 And thus they labored, with all diligence, <16 to the
<84 of the Lord of the <189 even <390 the bad had been
cast away out of the <13 and the Lord had <738 unto <4349
that the <442 had <964 <95 the <90 <775 and they became like
unto one body; and the fruits were equal; and the Lord of the <133
had <34 unto <34 the <27 <344 <188 was most <723
unto him from the beginning.

5:75 And it came to pass that when the Lord of the <34 saw that
his <157 was <2140 and that his <11 was no more corrupt, he
<5136 up his <804 and said unto <305 <1437 for this last time
have we <685 my <184 and thou <2093 that I have done
<138 to my <3740 and I have <83 the <81 <81 that it
is <53 even like as it was in the <84 And <5569 art thou;
for <954 ye have been <7392 in <7527 with me in my <156
and have kept my <6234 and have <394 unto me <154 the
<47 <47 that my <94 is no more <1752 and the bad is
cast <470 <838 ye <341 have joy with me <49 of the <122 of my
<464

5:76 For <404 for a long time will I lay up of the <21 of my
<47 unto mine own self <374 the <1777 <185 <404 <404
and for the last time have I <137 my <87 and <1709 it, and
dug <818 it, and <1712 it; <681 I will lay up unto mine own self
of the <95 for a long <825 <157 to that <45 I have spoken.

5:77 And when the time <6046 that evil <72 <102 <124 come into my
<54 then will I <1634 the good and the bad to be gathered; and
the good will I <1354 unto <3748 and the bad will I cast away into
its own place. And then <46 the <510 and the end; and my <119
will I <44 to be burned with <1202

<4304 <4304 6

6:1 And now, <156 my <4306 as I said unto you that I <1462
prophesy, <13 this is my prophecy—that the <4520 <108 this
<4286 Zenos spake, <5240 the <4271 of <4270 in the <13 he
likened them unto a tame <1937 must <11005 come to <14206

6:2 And the day that he <128 set his hand <131 the <2285 time to
<12524 his <5525 is the day, yea, even the last <168 that the
<571 of the Lord <28 go <752 in his <16839 to <641 and <721
his <353 and <4220 that the end soon cometh.

6:3 And how <333 are they who have <591 <1187 in his
<24 and how <6081 are they who <43 be cast out into <617 own
place! And the <4794 <12 be <156 with <156

6:4 And how <5953 is our God unto us, for he <16066 the <132
of <133 both <996 and <1155 and he stretches <85 his <4999
unto them all the day long; and they are a <4744 and a gainsaying
<4748 but as many as will not <9481 <66 <5811 <61 be <8964 in
the <7086 of God.

6:5 <1146 my <4566 <214 I beseech of you in <4489 of
soberness that ye <218 repent, and come with full <2654 of <6229
and cleave unto God as he cleaveth unto you. And <8481 his arm of mercy
is extended <6013 you in the <11127 of the day, <67 not your
<7725

6:6 Yea, <12499 if ye will hear his voice, <17 not your <9765 for
why will ye die?

6:7 For <283 <199 ye have been <423 by the good word of God
all the day <2120 will ye <982 <145 evil <414 that ye must be hewn
down and cast into the fire?

6:8 <602 will ye <4776 <1243 words? Will ye <5 the <123 of the
<15952 and will ye <10 all the <11 <324 have been <7170
<336 <5040 <67 so many have <8 <7 him; and deny
the good word of <15 and the <5121 of God, and the gift of the Holy
<10026 and quench the Holy <4723 and make a mock of the <5181 plan of
redemption, <51 hath been laid for you?

6:9 Know ye not that if ye will do <87 <5625 that the <49 of the
redemption and the <5181 <30 is in <63 will <128 you to
<9260 with <7926 and <5925 guilt <5162 the bar of God?

6:10 And <554 to the <36 of <5249 for <6523 <4969 be
denied, ye must go away into that lake of fire and <13604 <2008
flames are unquenchable, and <6 smoke ascendeth up forever and ever,
<62 lake of fire and <6019 is <13623 <13623

6:11 O <5354 my <301 <301 <6235 ye, and <8766 in at the <9479
<9486 and <9475 in the way <33 is narrow, <910 ye <338 <5286
<10474 <10474

6:12 O be wise; what can I say more?

6:13 Finally, I bid you <9217 <28 I <28 meet you <116 the
<6598 bar of God, <43 bar striketh the <8464 with <131 dread and
fear. <9197

<600 <600 7

7:1 And now it came to pass <240 some <5782 had <3395 <786 <1061
came a man <6453 the <5979 of <6110 <128 name was Sherem.

7:2 And it came to pass that he <1059 to <14164 <23 the <572 and
to <7807 unto them that <38 <1446 be no <9217 And he preached
many <639 <83 were flattering unto the <474 and this he did that
he <1200 <9242 the <9242 of <25

7:3 And he <569 <569 that he <16 lead away the <493 of the
<56 <5719 that he did lead away many <420 and he knowing that
I, <5182 had <5738 in <5439 who <68 come, he <5264 much
opportunity that he <38 come unto me.

7:4 And he was <14283 that he had a <5414 <5405 of the language
of the <86 <2199 he <2383 use much flattery, and much <293 of
speech, <300 to the <7 of the <9836

7:5 And he had hope to <6332 me from the <5502 <2737 the
many <5683 and the many <134 <134 I had seen <428 <372
<5380 for I <5822 had seen <11121 and they had <6177 unto me.
And <3815 I had <7193 the <9540 of the Lord <6214 unto me in very
<6190 from time to <15684 <84 I <84 not be shaken.

7:6 And it came to pass that he came unto me, and on this wise did he
<5544 unto me, <5146 Brother <156 I have <150 much <149
that I <150 <15 unto you; for I have <65 and also know that thou
goest <1004 much, <9291 that <102 ye call the gospel, or the
<228 of <228

7:7 And ye have led away much of this <301 that they <14437 the
<14438 way of God, and keep not the law of Moses <40 is the <14 way;
and convert the law of <12 into the <6079 of a <5809 <18 ye say
<391 come many <6137 <355 hence. And now <669 I, Sherem, <324
unto you that this is blasphemy; for no man <5891 of such <182 for
he <515 tell of <197 to <1494 And <389 this <8137 did Sherem
<15032 <1136 me.

7:8 But <42 the Lord God <16637 in his <5467 into my <18144
<322 that I did confound him in all his <4797

7:9 And I said unto him: Deniest thou the <326 who <86 <5697 And he
<2641 If <402 <334 be a <613 I <828 not deny him; but I know
that <15 is no <14 <6287 has been, nor ever will be.

7:10 And I said unto him: Believest thou the scriptures? And he said,
Yea.

7:11 And I said unto him: Then ye do not <7742 <1581 for they
<309 <8579 of <210 <781 I say unto you that none of the
<5699 have <10368 nor prophesied, save they have <766 <338
this <23

7:12 And this is not all—it has been made <9487 unto me, for I have
<275 and seen; and it also has been made <16 unto me by the <406
of the Holy <10919 <343 I know if <117 <132 be no <5865
made all mankind must be lost.

7:13 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Show me a sign by this
<43 of the Holy <828 in the <269 ye know so much.

7:14 And I said unto him: What am I that I <58 tempt God to show
unto thee a sign in the <6516 <32 thou <4346 to be true? Yet thou
wilt deny it, <1435 thou art of the <502 <3705 not my will
be done; but if God <239 <8252 <4129 let that be a sign unto thee that
he has <1207 both in <8824 and in <14740 and <489 that <265 <25
<318 And thy <5061 O <5563 be done, and not mine.

7:15 And it came to pass that when I, <465 had <200 <537 <6686
the <124 of the Lord came upon him, <327 that he fell to the
<12719 And it came to pass that he was <1061 for the space of many
days.

7:16 And it came to pass that he said unto the <15375 Gather <2059
on the <8582 for I <86 die; <217 I <8984 to <522 unto the
<485 <835 I <13 die.

7:17 And it came to pass that on the morrow the <17110 were <13303
<12633 and he <5716 plainly unto them and denied the <447 <183 he
had <9266 <2327 and confessed the <378 and the <110 of the Holy
<235 and the ministering of angels.

7:18 And he <37 <37 unto <27 that he had been deceived by the
<29 of the <210 And he <18 of <14651 and of eternity, and of
<952 punishment.

7:19 And he <453 I fear lest I have <7346 the unpardonable sin,
for I have lied unto God; for I <86 the <76 and said that I
<6672 the scriptures; and they <421 <421 of him. And <272 I
have thus lied unto God I greatly fear lest my case <146 be awful; but
I confess unto God.

7:20 And it came to pass that when he had said <240 <1220 he <741 say
no <2503 and he gave up the ghost.

7:21 And when the <174 had <11959 that he <117 <27 <167 as
he was <717 to give up the ghost, they were astonished <2047
<273 that the <144 of God came down upon <159 and they were
<2392 that they fell to the <286

7:22 Now, this <393 was <1076 unto me, <319 for I had requested
it of my <6788 who was in heaven; for he had <510 my cry and answered
my prayer.

7:23 And it came to pass that peace and the love of God was <13255
<1635 <1058 the <948 and they searched the <6119 and hearkened
no more to the <135 of this <1134 man.

7:24 And it came to pass that many <9983 were devised to reclaim and
restore the <7640 to the <996 of the <10797 but it all was
vain, for they delighted in wars and bloodshed, and they had an <267
<7520 <763 us, <1567 <7938 And they <899 by the <150 of
<10 arms to <7586 us continually.

7:25 <1572 the <384 of <9727 did fortify <29 them with <20
arms, and with all <6 might, trusting in the God and rock of <9
salvation; <418 they <2158 as yet, conquerors of <10 enemies.

7:26 And it came to pass that I, <182 <1199 to be old; and the record
of this <57 <893 kept on the <2440 <7159 of <1233 <40 I
conclude this record, declaring that I have <7063 <1101 to the
best of my <11387 by <5701 that the time <1269 away with us, and
also our lives <9 away like as it were unto us a dream, we <52 a
lonesome and a solemn <1208 wanderers, cast out from <8214 born
in tribulation, in a wilderness, and <14384 of our <1404 <485
<5764 wars and contentions; <75 we did <11474 out our <565

7:27 And I, <108 saw that I must soon go down to my grave; <24
I said unto my son Enos: Take <359 plates. And I told him the <365
<48 my <9663 <184 had <2571 me, and he <16785 obedience unto
the commands. And I make an end of my writing upon <33 <7244 <26
<6 has been small; and to the reader I bid <1445 <7257 that
many of my <7259 may read my <991 Brethren, adieu.




 THE BOOK OF ENOS


1:1 <926 it came to pass that I, Enos, <1343 my father that he was
a just man—for he <620 me in his <12919 and also in the nurture
and admonition of the Lord—and <1967 be the name of my God for it—

1:2 And I will tell you of the wrestle <102 I had <697 God, <2 I
<9461 a <12260 of my sins.

1:3 <74 I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the <416 <30 I
had often <465 my <83 <737 <1002 <378 <11088 and the joy of
the saints, sunk deep into my <8239

1:4 And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down <61 my <9636 and I
cried unto him in <11504 prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and
all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the <17947 came I did
<11687 <8610 my <1385 high that it reached the heavens.

1:5 And <1035 came a <15 unto me, <1358 <175 thy sins are forgiven
<946 and thou <17034 be blessed.

1:6 And I, <18 knew that God <668 not lie; <297 my <1799 was
swept <4216

1:7 And I <761 <949 how is it <12300

1:8 And he said unto me: <15968 of thy <1567 in <760 whom thou hast
never <124 <156 nor seen. And many <1333 pass away <9 he <747
<1134 <2624 in the flesh; <57 go to, thy <30 hath made
thee whole.

1:9 Now, it came to pass that when I had <40 <336 <204 I <499 to
feel a <941 for the <9923 of my <423 the <10336 <41
I did pour out my whole soul unto God for <3778

1:10 And <2117 I was thus struggling in the spirit, <1366 the <155
of the Lord came into my mind <3056 <162 I will <8651 thy <375
<528 to <574 <14897 in <8214 my <13079 I have <8267
unto them this <9541 and it is a holy <13857 and I curse it not save it
be for the <2443 of <9065 <81 I will <43 thy <43
<43 as I have said; and <47 transgressions will I <2002 down
with sorrow upon <10 own heads.

1:11 And <1466 I, <219 had <134 <134 <1129 my <157 <135 to be
<12480 in the <14202 and I prayed unto him with many long strugglings
for my <144 the Lamanites.

1:12 And it came to pass that <42 I had <26 and <1822 with all
<2897 the Lord said unto me: I will grant unto thee <86 to
thy desires, <988 of thy <17237

1:13 And now <163 this was the <202 <413 I <7031 of him—that if
it <1308 so be, that my <650 the <10490 <8 fall into
transgression, and by any <838 be <15965 and the <834 <14
not be <8 that the Lord God <1524 <2628 a <743 of my
<33 the <243 even if it so be by the <825 of his holy arm,
that it <1729 be <2805 <2292 at some future day unto the <8585
<3751 <3723 they <15 be <15 unto salvation—

1:14 For at the present our <150 were vain in restoring them to
the true <115 And they swore in <198 <10899 <34 if it were
<11021 they <78 <881 our records and us, and also all the
traditions of our <8302

1:15 <892 I <629 that the Lord God was able to <106 our
records, I <522 unto him continually, for he had said unto me:
Whatsoever <1058 ye <407 ask in <1926 believing that ye <7 <7952
in the name of <438 ye <9 <9 it.

1:16 And I had <23 and I did cry unto God that he <83 <55 the
records; and he <14593 with me that he <12 <309 them <148 unto
the <190 in his own due <3703

1:17 And I, <311 knew it <22 be <256 to the <14511 <240 he
had made; <2894 my soul did rest.

1:18 And the Lord said unto me: Thy fathers have also required of me
this <18951 and it <91 be done unto them <41 to <171 faith;
for <4 <358 was like unto thine.

1:19 And now it came to pass that I, <70 went <1236 <1149 the <1003
of <998 <13833 of <885 to <2137 and testifying of the <7
<81 I had <402 and <576

1:20 And I bear <292 that the <31 of <907 did seek <2198 to
<1152 the <128 unto the true <67 in God. But our labors were
<18929 <77 <1140 was fixed, and they were led by <9 evil nature
that they <1101 <4230 and ferocious, and a bloodthirsty <336 full
of idolatry and <8577 feeding upon <811 of prey; dwelling in
tents, and wandering <97 in the <8029 with a short skin <14221
<10 <42 <9492 and <3 <8532 shaven; and <4 skill was in the
bow, and in the cimeter, and the ax. And many of them did eat <5077
save it was raw meat; and they were <12211 seeking to <333 us.

1:21 And it came to pass that the <127 of <127 did till the <604
and <811 all <2021 of grain, and of <2703 and flocks of herds, and
<5 of all <15 of cattle of <5688 kind, and goats, and wild
<4 and also many horses.

1:22 And <835 were <4154 many <1930 <212 us. And the <56
were a <2880 <143 hard to <7605

1:23 And <23 was <98 save it was <9155 harshness, <2190

<106 reminding them of <11285 and the duration of <1615 and
the <10108 and the <514 of God, and all <652 things—stirring them
up <26 to keep them in the fear of the <7389 I say <58 was

<658 this <130 do I <8463 <1028 <807

1:24 And I saw wars between the <15098 and <291 in the course of
my <1252

1:25 And it came to pass that I <730 to be old, and an <2244 and
seventy and nine <916 had <1326 away from the time that our <1084
Lehi left Jerusalem.

1:26 And I saw that I must soon go down to my grave, <7618 been
<17179 upon by the <136 of God that I must <2616 and <7895 unto
this <193 and <2293 the word <446 to the <7895 <406 is in

 THE BOOK OF JAROM


1:1 Now <862 I, Jarom, <237 a few <1073 <141 to the
<9094 of my <9629 <571 that our genealogy may be kept.

1:2 And as <287 <1577 are small, and as <6 <573 are <1572 for
the <8560 of the <19847 of our <1012 the <832 <1020 it
must <7971 be that I <55 a <16376 but I <119 not <7 the <32
of my <11856 nor of my revelations. For what <1230 I <15 more
than my <681 have written? For have not they <8394 the plan of
<19769 I say unto you, Yea; and this <14435 me.

1:3 <1393 it is expedient that much <944 be done <461 this <261
<996 of the hardness of <568 <8762 and the deafness of <6
<16731 and the <8066 of <7 minds, and the stiffness of <6
necks; <11537 God is <410 <3403 unto <1927 and has not
as yet <1308 them off from the face of the land.

1:4 And <214 are many <61 us who have many <11898 for they are
not all stiffnecked. And as many as are not <533 and have <869
have communion with the Holy <3212 <302 <12750 <1310 unto the
<8580 of men, <213 to <74 <977

1:5 And now, <230 two <426 <421 had <421 <3025 and the <576
of <633 had <7862 <4469 in the <76 They observed to keep the law of
<2709 and the sabbath day holy unto the <533 And they profaned not;
<2600 did they blaspheme. And the laws of the land were <128
strict.

1:6 And they were <15156 upon much of the face of the <687 and the
<523 <15950 And they were <27 more numerous than were they
of the <1127 and they <11826 murder and <574 drink the <11449 of
beasts.

1:7 And it came to pass that they came many <20235 <1951 us, the
<1191 to battle. But our kings and our leaders were <1583 men in
the <870 of the <1290 and they <1707 the <133 the ways of the <10
<329 we withstood the <79 and <221 them away out of our
<19632 and <594 to <2003 our cities, or <9117 <434 of our
inheritance.

1:8 And we multiplied <11916 and spread upon the face of the
<122 and <906 <116 rich in <10976 and in <10976 and in
<4148 <694 and in fine <8668 of wood, in buildings, and in
machinery, and also in iron and copper, and brass and steel, making all
<699 of tools of <829 kind to till the <5892 and weapons of
war—yea, the sharp pointed arrow, and the quiver, and the dart, and the
javelin, and all preparations for war.

1:9 And thus <2003 <535 to meet the <458 they did not prosper
<168 us. But the word of the Lord was verified, <312 he <2322 unto
our <15483 <2055 that: Inasmuch as ye will keep my <4318 ye
<478 <31 in the <297

1:10 And it came to pass that the <899 of the Lord did threaten the
<193 of <1115 <348 to the word of God, that if they did not
keep the <4181 but <467 fall into <1424 they <5
be <20647 from off the face of the <54

1:11 <1325 the <8550 and the priests, and the <17694 did
<4500 diligently, exhorting with all long-suffering the <57 to
<11766 teaching the law of <9142 and the <592 for <112 it was
given; persuading them to look <14025 unto the Messiah, and <12239 in
him to come as though he <11391 was. And <900 this <201 did they
<11816 <900

1:12 And it came to pass that by so doing they kept them from <184
<96 upon the face of the <1679 for they did prick <477 <3406
with the <3272 <982 stirring them up unto <20351

1:13 And it came to pass that two <490 and thirty and eight <494
had <495 away—after the <70 of <1045 and <1045 and
dissensions, for the <2776 of much of the <1381

1:14 And I, <753 do not <678 <2575 for the <733 are small. But
<537 my <1679 ye can go to the <2324 <14 of Nephi; for
<14 upon them the <1522 of our wars are engraven, <223 to
the writings of the kings, or <5428 <166 they <2277 to be <16262

1:15 And I <19158 <780 <39 into the <4043 of my son Omni, that
they may be kept <38 to the <294 of my <1561




 THE BOOK OF OMNI


1:1 <745 it came to pass that I, <41 <178 <2288 by my <854
<115 that I <284 <116 <8386 upon <63 <2281 to <1536 our
genealogy—

1:2 <284 in my <1008 I <569 that ye <23 know that I fought
much with the <12395 to <27 my <787 the <562 from falling
into the <99 of <220 enemies, the <1830 But <143 I of <4836
am a <2615 man, and I have not kept the statutes and the <110
of the Lord as I <10539 to have <10538

1:3 And it came to pass that two <242 and <1157 and six <242 had
<242 <737 and we had many seasons of peace; and we had many <7
of serious war and bloodshed. Yea, and in <17423 two <33 and eighty
and two <34 had <33 <33 and I had kept <134 <197 <184 to
the <75 of my <10165 and I conferred them upon my son
Amaron. And I make an end.

1:4 And now I, Amaron, <169 the <978 <646 I write, <248 are
few, in the book of my father.

1:5 <207 it came to pass that <19703 <73 and twenty <70 had
<71 <71 and the more <150 part of the <1306 were <16239

1:6 For the Lord <202 not <10827 <437 he had led them out of the
land of Jerusalem and kept and <4752 them from <203 into the
<203 of <203 <203 yea, he <31 not <11051 that the <1125 <236
not be <614 <88 he <614 unto our <613 <613 <613 <613
as ye will not keep my <136 ye <614 not <615 in the <561

1:7 <277 the Lord did <2136 them in <1427 judgment; <1023
he did <6165 the <10459 that they <51 not <5399 but did <375
them out of the <74 of <74 <2774

1:8 And it came to pass that I did <22 the <200 unto my <2641
Chemish.

1:9 Now I, Chemish, <182 what few <183 I <182 in the same book
with my brother; for <316 I saw the last <108 he wrote, that he
wrote it with his own hand; and he <8 it in the day that he
<9171 them unto me. And <174 this <541 we keep the <1986 for
it is <270 to the <133 of our <454 And I make an end.

1:10 <236 I, Abinadom, am the son of <89 <8 it came to
pass that I saw much war and contention <1543 my <413 the
<414 and the Lamanites; and I, with my own sword, have <6680 the
<2852 of many of the <961 in the defence of my <2982

1:11 And <116 the <1881 of this <739 is <10014 upon <153
<122 is had by the <574 <90 to the generations; and I know of
no <13174 save that <19 has been <3659 <1119 <9827
<1014 that <9 is sufficient is <593 And I make an end.

1:12 <102 I am Amaleki, the son of Abinadom. <8 I will <2682
unto you <549 <1658 Mosiah, who was made king over the land of
Zarahemla; for <82 he <576 warned of the Lord that he <264 flee
out of the land of <888 and as many as <334 <10423 unto the <2487
of the Lord <22 also <21179 out of the land with him, into the
wilderness—

1:13 And it came to pass that he did <121 as the Lord had
<635 him. And they departed out of the land into the <2993
as many as <56 <56 unto the <56 of the <1146 and they were led
by many preachings and prophesyings. And they were admonished
<834 by the word of God; and they were led by the <1702 of his
arm, <9714 the <47 <4393 they came down into the land <171
is <5242 the land of Zarahemla.

1:14 And they discovered a <260 who were <16 the <226 of
<17 Now, <1414 was <422 rejoicing <1415 the <11 of
<165 and also Zarahemla did <1680 <1194 <1484 the Lord
had sent the <17 of Mosiah with the <255 of <1166 <57 contained
the <269 of the <16611

1:15 <218 it came to pass that <24 <62 that the <30 of
<44 came out from <543 at the time that Zedekiah, king of
Judah, was carried away <11340 into Babylon.

1:16 And they journeyed in the <119 and were <2456 by the hand
of the Lord across the <96 waters, into the land where <55
<56 <3989 and they had dwelt <112 from that time forth.

1:17 And at the time that <22 <21 <1563 they had <5471
<1300 numerous. <3853 they had had many wars and <746
<999 and had fallen by the <837 from time to <4310 and <552

<63 and they <3643 the <327 of <21 Creator; and <346 nor the
<131 of <6 <1701 <4071 <1113

1:18 But it came to pass that <74 <990 that they <327 be <1428

<66 of <40 <171 gave a <1804 of his <683

1:19 And it came to pass that the <75 of Zarahemla, and of <38

1:20 And it came to pass in the days of <26 <179 was a large <9699

1:21 And they gave an account of one Coriantumr, and the slain of his
<11117 And Coriantumr was <213 by the <84 of <336 and
he <238 with them for the <1203 of nine moons.

1:22 It also <817 a few <828 <535 his <673 And his <6322
parents came out from the tower, at the time the Lord confounded the
<165 of the <3684 and the severity of the Lord fell upon them
<168 to his judgments, <376 are just; and <136 bones lay
<1715 in the land northward.

1:23 <381 I, <606 was born in the days of Mosiah; and I have
lived to see his <10975 and Benjamin, his son, reigneth in his stead.

1:24 And <610 I have seen, in the days of king <21 a <325
war and much bloodshed <745 the <982 and the <1148 But
<25 the <8 did <4936 much <19321 over <319 yea, <3862
that king Benjamin did drive them out of the land of <506

1:25 And it came to pass that I <1714 to be old; and, <2271 no <12634
and <2837 king <33 to be a just man <2185 the <3263 <736
I <977 <923 up <297 <516 unto him, <1522 all men to come
unto God, the Holy One of <5386 and <1504 in <2084 and in
<1973 and in the <4104 of <4757 and in the gift of
<4746 with <16977 and in the gift of interpreting languages, and
in all <958 <188 are <9096 for <308 is <2455 <7 is good save
it comes from the <680 and that <12 is evil <5637 from the <4129

1:26 And now, my <5102 <1452 I <707 that ye <430 come unto
<2908 who is the Holy One of <86 and <13910 of his salvation,
and the <339 of his redemption. Yea, come unto him, and offer your

praying, and <14788 to the end; and as the Lord <20039 ye will be

 THE WORDS OF MORMON


1:1 And now I, Mormon, <137 <46 to <355 up the <864 <286 I
have been <2038 into the <1306 of my son Moroni, <6079 I have
<4309 <7720 all the <23050 of my <934 the Nephites.

1:2 And it is many <1457 <1455 <720 the coming of <4625 that I
<49 <89 <780 into the <42 of my son; and it <13348 me
that he will <18247 the entire <44 of my <632 But may God
<3445 that he may survive <850 that he may <1349 <279 <141
<8 and <5 <5 <352 that <7366 some day it may
<8438 <155

1:3 And now, I <304 <20 <20 that <111 I have <17631 for
<80 I had made an abridgment from the <167 of <1164 down to the
<13925 of this king <571 of whom Amaleki <6005 I <4331 <271
the <99 <36 had been <1375 into my <20291 and I <13758 <111
<1773 <13 <1029 this <11334 <738 of the <2053 from <5468
down to the <42 of this king <42 and also many of the <717 of
<11474

1:4 And the <500 <35 are upon <41 <74 <4442 me, <1086 of
the prophecies of the <170 of <15008 and my <2621 <589 that
many of them have been fulfilled; yea, and I also know that as many
<39 as have been prophesied <129 us down to this day have been
fulfilled, and as many as go <10667 this day must <6104 come to pass—

1:5 <420 I chose <70 <2325 to finish my <274 upon <189
<82 remainder of my <8 I <643 take from the <88 of <467 and
I <5197 <212 the <11650 part of the <67 of my <235

1:6 But <728 I <28 take <45 <155 <38 contain <4
prophesyings and <654 and put them with the <49 of my
<4363 for they are <8281 unto me; and I know they will be <9
unto my <1490

1:7 And I do this for a wise purpose; for thus it <19453 me,
<864 to the <10716 of the <5249 of the Lord <62 is in me. And
now, I do not know all <5297 but the Lord <5304 all <95 <19
are to come; <764 he <22715 in me to do <41 to his <10241

1:8 And my <4133 to God is <184 my <695 that they may once
<513 come to the <4585 of God, yea, the <5895 of <230 that
they may once <17 be a <17770 <148

1:9 And now I, <467 <15022 to <191 out my <134 <70 I take
from the <185 of <185 and I make it <71 to the <48 and
the <11012 <21 God has <3978 me.

1:10 <231 it came to pass that <385 <364 had <355 up

Benjamin.

1:11 And they were <24 down from king <46 from <21 to
<3 <24 they have <1323 into my hands. And I, <117 pray to
God that they may be <1964 from this time henceforth. And I know
that they will be preserved; for <776 are <1404 <208 <3059 upon

down out of the land of <551 to battle <2660 his <30 But
<377 king <1060 <5155 <5194 his armies, and he did <3248
<17 <764 and he did <18461 with the <6995 of his own arm, with
the <1464 of Laban.

1:14 And in the <18 of the Lord they did <5621 <33 <118
<2103 <168 they had <1306 many thousands of the <1165 And it
came to pass that they did <23 <23 the <87 <22 they had
driven them out of all the <13011 of <37 <930

1:15 And it came to pass that <279 <182 had been <20201 Christs, and
<20 mouths had been shut, and they punished <171 to <10
crimes;

dissensions away unto the <2832 <162 it came to pass that king
<295 with the assistance of the holy <2798 who were <47 his
people—

1:17 For <27 king <189 was a holy man, and he did <711 over
his <277 in righteousness; and <58 were many holy men in the <2970
and they did <798 the word of God with <1157 and with authority; and
they did use much sharpness <720 of the <16344 of the

of <717 <39 <245 the <14 and the <25 of our <92 from
the time they left <2252 <656 now, and they are true; and we can
know of <70 surety <77 we have them <125 our eyes.

1:7 And now, my <73 I <73 that ye <73 <73 to <12390 them
<3328 that ye may <1358 thereby; and I <17 that ye <17 keep
the <163 of God, that ye may <2808 in the land <649 to
the <20041 <86 the Lord made unto our <2018

1:8 And many more <893 did king <476 <256 his <61 <21 are
not <903 in this <22810

1:9 And it came to pass that <687 king <24 had made an end of
<3396 his <30 that he <3783 old, and he saw that he must very soon
go the way of all the <6140 <10502 he thought it <3935 that he
<98 confer the <7248 upon one of his sons.

1:10 <20574 he had <588 <2181 <148 him; and <198 are the
<1402 <84 he <2125 unto him, <458 My son, I <136 that ye <38
make a proclamation throughout all this land <598 all this <790 or
the <602 of <609 and the <5 of <45 who <18773 in the
<728 that <390 they may be <945 <2267 for on the <6109 I
<1026 proclaim unto this my <27 out of mine own <16209 that thou art
a king and a <15678 over this <53 whom the Lord our God hath <1181
us.

1:11 And moreover, I <39 give this <37 a <12710 that <58 they
may be distinguished <4296 all the <13 <111 the Lord God hath
<126 out of the land of <16121 and this I do <288 they have
been a <7825 <25 in <5217 the <259 of the <617

1:12 And I give unto them a name that <5345 <62 be blotted out,
<543 it be <2687 transgression.

1:13 Yea, and moreover I say unto you, that if this highly favored
<48 of the Lord <175 fall into <3682 and <700 a <3192
and an adulterous <122 that the Lord will <1746 them up, that
<108 they <19 weak like unto <377 brethren; and he will no more
<3395 them by his matchless and <12652 <6411 as he has <10117
<538 our <337

1:14 For I say unto you, that if he had not <7475 his arm in the
preservation of our <444 they must have <1283 into the <1344 of the
<530 and <64 victims to <63 hatred.

1:15 And it came to pass that <356 king <356 had made an end of
<304 <485 to his son, that he gave him charge <561 all the
affairs of the kingdom.

1:16 And <230 he also gave him <19 <19 the <518 <220
were <794 on the <532 of brass; and also the <6 of <1458 and
<6521 the <1223 of Laban, and the ball or director, <27 led our
<100 <199 the <2068 <8 was <3944 by the hand of the
Lord that <168 they <673 be led, <3995 one <494 to the heed
and <5472 <25 they gave unto him.

1:17 <413 as they were unfaithful they did not <522 nor
progress in <135 journey, but were <1243 back, and incurred the
displeasure of God upon <1315 and <790 they were <24515 with
famine and sore <13979 to stir them up in <15984 of <33
duty.

1:18 And now, it came to pass that <425 went and did as his <4724
had <3048 him, and proclaimed unto all the <293 who were in the
land of <2744 that <109 they <109 <11024 <14593 together,
to go up to the <15170 to hear the <503 <112 his <39 <319 <1189
unto <1998

<54 <1112 2

2:1 And it came to pass that <237 <14 had done as his <28 had
<67 him, and had made a <526 <526 all the <505
that the <74 <504 <62 <1450 <11 all the <11
that they <73 go up to the <68 to hear the <68 <68 king
<282 <69 <69 unto <68

2:2 And <1173 were a <1552 <2263 even so many that they did not
<2355 <171 for they had <4269 <2957 and <657 <19 in the
<1226

2:3 And they also took of the firstlings of <177 flocks, that they
<67 <2453 sacrifice and burnt offerings <250 to the law of
Moses;

2:4 And also that they <21 give thanks to the Lord <32 God, who had
<543 them out of the land of <6235 and who had <1153 them
out of the <408 of <24 <1533 and had <2898 just men to be
<10 <4157 and also a just man to be <9 <16074 who had
established <1265 in the land of <679 and who had <952 them to
keep the <580 of God, that they <75 <3198 and be filled
with love <7953 God and all men.

2:5 And it came to pass that when they came up to the <16050 they
pitched <59 tents <25106 <12070 <379 man <129 to his family,
consisting of his <14101 and his <829 and his daughters, and <22
<7 and <4 <7 from the eldest down to the youngest, <31
family <2389 separate one from <20543

2:6 And they <50 <24 <50 <50 <2403 the <59 <21 man
<1187 his tent with the door <8703 <91 the <13 that <341
they <106 remain in <26 <26 and hear the <268 <268 king <267
<268 <268 unto <248

2:7 For the <6734 <59 so <250 that king <18 <1205 not <949
them all within the walls of the <46 <443 he <1401 a tower to
be erected, that <55 his <334 <55 hear the <50 <50 he
<49 <49 unto <317

2:8 And it came to pass that he <2878 to <16 to his <28 from the
tower; and they <59 not all hear his <36 <797 of the <15693
of the multitude; <61 he <61 that the <14 <50 he <939
<51 be <1025 and sent <5669 <928 <4229 that were not <15681 the
sound of his <8157 that they <78 also <5719 his <6425

2:9 And <674 are the <38 <38 he <38 and <46 to be <3229
<981 My <1247 all ye that have assembled <13262 <504
you that can hear my <26 <26 I <849 <97 unto you this day; for I
have not <480 you to come up <11479 to trifle with the <24 <24
I <25 speak, but that you <92 <3598 unto me, and open your ears
that ye may hear, and your <4429 that ye may <13028 and your
<14546 that the <1474 of God may be unfolded to your view.

2:10 I have not <61 you to come up <61 that ye <50 fear me,
or that ye <7 think that I of <4249 am more than a <5248 man.

2:11 But I am like as <15504 subject to all <3922 of infirmities
in body and mind; yet I have been chosen by this <933 and
<16410 by my <1537 and was <1566 by the hand of the Lord that
I <59 be a <1080 and a king over this <3255 and have been kept and
<931 by his <943 <941 to serve you with all the <6853 mind
and <2045 <156 the Lord hath granted unto me.

2:12 I say unto you that as I have been <62 to spend my days in
your service, even up to this <1633 and have not <6928 gold nor silver
nor any <110 of riches of you;

2:13 Neither have I <36 that ye <91 be confined in dungeons,
nor that ye <9 make slaves one of <12387 nor that ye <9
<25207 or plunder, or steal, or <14994 adultery; nor even have I
<36 that ye <18 <11 any <54 of <18295 and have
<574 you that ye <13 keep the <575 of the <3248 in all
<1392 <119 he hath <228 you—

2:14 And even I, <8836 have <6287 with mine own <643 that I <360
<152 you, and that ye <39 not be laden with taxes, and that <754
<10 <1594 come upon you <43 was grievous to be borne—and of all
<381 <54 <11 I have <24097 ye <367 are <13424 this day.

2:15 Yet, my <384 I have not done <23 <23 that I <58 boast,
<4073 do I tell <11 <11 that <509 I <12 accuse you; but I
tell you <13 <13 that ye may know that I can answer a <9675
conscience <1423 God this day.

2:16 <3486 I say unto you that <504 I said unto you that I had
spent my days in your <232 I do not <6384 to <67 for I have
only been in the service of God.

2:17 And <1664 I tell you <69 <69 that ye may <14177 <21849 that
ye may <6 that when ye are in the <30 of your fellow beings ye
are only in the <11 of your God.

2:18 <84 ye have <2048 me your king; and if I, whom ye call your
<823 do <4988 to <201 you, then <4659 not ye to <9 to <9 one
<21295

2:19 And <3118 <1197 if I, whom ye call your <30 who has <117 his
days in your <118 and yet has been in the <69 of God, do merit
any <924 from you, O how you <52 to <21598 your heavenly King!

2:20 I say unto you, my <224 that if you <260 render all the
<30 and <25248 <252 your <2240 soul has <2289 to possess, to that
God who has <13967 you, and has kept and <461 you, and has <651
that ye <36 rejoice, and has <453 that ye <7 live in <942
one with another—

2:21 I say unto you that if ye <19 <128 him who has <45 you
from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by lending
you breath, that ye may live and move and do <931 to your own
<7864 and even supporting you from one moment to another—I say, if ye
<51 <51 him with all your <109 <3540 yet ye <1714 be unprofitable
servants.

2:22 And <267 all that he requires of you is to keep his
commandments; and he has <7247 you that if ye <31 keep his
<464 ye <47 <1353 in the <5149 and he <1612 doth vary from
that <165 he hath <6814 <1811 if ye do keep his <25 he
doth bless you and <29 you.

2:23 And now, in the <3914 place, he hath <137 you, and <167 unto
you your lives, for <41 ye are indebted unto him.

2:24 And secondly, he doth require that ye <71 do as he hath
<532 you; for <26 if ye do, he doth immediately <60 you; and
<918 he hath paid you. And ye are <7134 <43 unto him, and
are, and will be, <8850 and ever; <95 of what have ye to
boast?

2:25 And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves? I <485 you, Nay.
Ye <3194 say that ye are even as much as the dust of the <1948 yet ye
were <114 of the dust of the <11 but <193 it belongeth to him
who <15 you.

2:26 And I, even I, whom ye call your <395 am no <15170 than ye
<593 are; for I am also of the <26165 And ye <421 that I am old,
and am <1163 to <26539 up this <876 frame to its <10596 <7821

2:27 <1588 as I said unto you that I had served you, walking with
a <591 <590 <590 God, even so I at this time have <382 that
ye <187 assemble <66 <1026 that I <631 be <3457
blameless, and that your <5784 <15 not come upon me, when I <1010
<2933 to be <3014 of God of the <579 whereof he hath <217 me
<1729 you.

2:28 I say unto you that I have <56 that ye <40 <55
<56 <1524 that I <56 rid my <17202 of your blood, at this
period of time when I am <123 to go down to my <6340 that I <25 go
down in peace, and my immortal <14631 may join the choirs <2012 in
singing the <19997 of a just God.

2:29 And <1812 I say unto you that I have <72 that ye <72
<73 <72 <128 that I <47 <6369 unto you that I can
no longer be your teacher, nor your <654

2:30 For even at this <960 my <459 <200 doth tremble <1579
<7296 attempting to <1181 unto you; but the Lord God doth support me,
and hath <925 me that I <59 <18 unto you, and hath <156
me that I <11 <63 unto you this day, that my son <1696 is a
king and a <1077 over you.

2:31 And now, my <645 I <489 that ye <31 do as ye have
<2018 <5380 As ye have kept my <2688 and also the
<481 of my <1129 and have prospered, and have been kept from
<5240 into the <960 of your <1603 even so if ye <248 keep the
<28 of my son, or the <6 of God <461 <14 be
<1634 unto you by him, ye <9 <522 in the <1758 and your
enemies <9 have no <710 over you.

2:32 But, O my <1201 beware lest <998 <17 arise <3277 <1391
you, and ye list to obey the evil <7455 <50 was <2845 of by my
<1825 Mosiah.

2:33 For <439 <30 is a wo pronounced upon him who listeth to obey
that <26616 for if he <9 to obey him, and remaineth and dieth in
his <17510 the same <25582 damnation to his own <7698 for he <22772
for his wages an <18543 punishment, <1597 transgressed the law of
God contrary to his own knowledge.

2:34 I say unto you, that <68 are not any <98 you, <2279 it be
your <11508 <6308 that have not been <1164 <395 <983 <2704
but what <3652 that ye are eternally <603 to your <881
<19821 to <869 to him all that you have and are; and also have been
<33 <33 the <2157 <137 <2679 the <2987 <4 have
been <143 by the holy <3124 even down to the time our <240
<2907 left <2388

2:35 And <972 all that has been <26 by our <2163 <2700 now. And
<165 <14 they <1554 that <43 was <327 them of the <4417
<671 they are just and <2748

2:36 And now, I say unto you, my <319 that <2035 ye have <4210 and
have been <86 all <119 <119 if ye <330 transgress and go
<161 to that <49 has been <1228 that ye do withdraw <444
from the <3810 of the <1302 that it may have no <6283 in you to guide
you in wisdom’s paths that ye may be <6735 <350 and preserved—

2:37 I say unto you, that the man that <25779 <25114 the same <4509 out
in open rebellion <3478 God; <796 he <266 to obey the evil
<305 and <15158 an enemy to all <3358 <120 the Lord
has no <64 in him, for he dwelleth not in unholy temples.

2:38 Therefore if that man repenteth not, and <302 and <302 an
<36 to God, the demands of divine <9709 do awaken his <593 soul
to a lively sense of his own guilt, <133 doth <7771 him to <17678 from
the <17465 of the <130 and doth fill his breast with <20 and
pain, and anguish, <25 is like an unquenchable <10969 <9605 <26004
<9734 up <884 and ever.

2:39 And now I say unto you, that <9992 hath no claim on that man;
<128 his final doom is to <4587 a never-ending <9753

2:40 O, all ye old men, and also ye <14226 men, and you <356 <356
who can <3096 my <7820 for I have <290 <8823 unto you that ye
<667 <1766 I pray that ye <249 <15851 to a <2385 of the
<9728 situation of <1886 that have <2573 into <2676

2:41 And <713 I <606 <1403 that ye <28 <18806 on the
<8258 and happy state of <27 that keep the <569 of God. For
<342 they are <17 in all <305 both temporal and spiritual;
and if they hold out <25517 to the end they are <8266 into heaven,
that <1509 they may <2866 with God in a <47 of <127
happiness. O remember, <3055 that <345 <868 are <3089 for the
Lord God hath <115 it.

<708 <2418 3

3:1 And <4080 my <382 I <95 call your attention, for I have
<3893 more to <750 unto you; for <87 I have <44 to tell you
<482 that <227 is to <9140

3:2 And the <17 <11 I <645 tell you are made <422 unto me by an
angel from God. And he said unto me: Awake; and I awoke, and <1041 he
stood <1005 me.

3:3 And he said unto me: Awake, and hear the <1999 <46 I <46 tell
<14252 for <74 I am come to <822 unto you the glad tidings of
<2190 joy.

3:4 For the Lord hath <7668 thy prayers, and hath <1016 of thy
<15638 and hath sent me to <33 unto thee that thou mayest
<15815 and that thou <6 <12 unto thy <753 that they may
also be <2365 with joy.

3:5 For <68 the time <16519 and is not far distant, that with
<1942 the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all
eternity to all <7502 <102 come down from <9312 <697 the
<336 of men, and <12 <240 in a tabernacle of clay, and <8 go
<2205 amongst men, <27590 <4884 <27590 such as <17967 the sick,
raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the <25062 to <2211 <2344
sight, and the deaf to <2137 and curing all <1907 of diseases.

3:6 And he <47 cast out devils, or the evil spirits <179 <63 in
the <2160 of the <75 of men.

3:7 And lo, he <26 <6175 temptations, and pain of body, hunger,
thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can <6222 <801 it be unto
<5291 for <147 <1217 <611 from <2439 pore, so <209 <33 be his
anguish for the <17087 and the <17087 of his <4173

3:8 And he <20 be <1768 <15767 <4777 the Son of God, the <9103 of
<155 and <15601 the <18297 of all <317 from the beginning; and his
<1321 <28 be <28 Mary.

3:9 And lo, he <65 unto his own, that <15391 <502 come unto the
<113 of men even <2967 <7046 on his name; and even <775 all this
they <38 <489 him a man, and say that he hath a <16354 and <13
<16786 him, and <5 crucify him.

3:10 And he <9 rise the <18893 day from the dead; and <130 he
standeth to <19701 the <19036 and <9 all <472 <94 are done that
a <6295 <19498 <77 come upon the <76 of men.

3:11 For <23 and also his <165 atoneth for the sins of <557 who
have <585 by the transgression of Adam, who have died not <3849 the
will of God <473 <3679 or who have ignorantly sinned.

3:12 But wo, wo unto him who <999 that he rebelleth <816 God! For
<145 <151 to none such <229 it be <143 <21113 and <145
on the Lord <202 <7687

3:13 And the Lord God hath sent his holy <4219 <361 all the
<98 of men, to <421 <116 <116 to <256 <27948 <27950 and
<21313 that <615 whosoever <664 <3763 that <5066 <4 <8144
the same <128 <351 <8897 of <353 <1137 and <2808 with
<1354 <282 joy, even as <6964 he had <6965 come <50 <2652

3:14 Yet the Lord God saw that his <2647 were a <5285 <477
and he <2884 unto them a law, even the law of Moses.

3:15 And many <28014 and <28014 and types, and shadows <21893 he unto
<153 <155 his <16247 and also holy <106 <1069 unto them
<11 his <11 and yet they hardened <83 <7563 and
understood not that the law of <7445 availeth <2284 <156 it were
<157 the <9923 of his blood.

3:16 And even if it were <4047 that <846 <148 <2730 sin they
<4 not be saved; but I say unto you they are blessed; for <256 as
in <241 or by nature, they fall, even so the <265 of <161 <267
for <72 <9052

3:17 And <845 I say unto you, that <1264 <330 be no <4764 name
<3621 nor any <6 way nor <8623 <21094 <248 can come unto the
<71 of men, only in and <95 the name of <449 the Lord
Omnipotent.

3:18 For <733 he judgeth, and his <347 is <5824 and the infant
perisheth not that <1062 in his infancy; but men <7514 <1363 to
<79 own <2046 <141 they <24827 <3218 and <3497 as <127
<4115 and <260 that <67 was, and is, and is to <265 in
and <66 the atoning <115 of <67 the Lord <66

3:19 For the <11475 man is an <1115 to God, and has been from the fall
of <151 and will be, <1072 and <10806 <17025 he yields to the
enticings of the Holy <7707 and <24173 off the <37 man and
<1190 a saint <59 the <220 of <173 the <1127 and <11
as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of <27467 <21700 to
submit to all <370 <672 the Lord <25612 fit to inflict upon him, even
as a <22544 doth <19 to his <6916

3:20 And <209 I say unto you, that the time <210 come when the
<5019 of the <21835 <9 <7583 <3366 <413 <412 <414
<412 and <658

3:21 And <267 when that time <833 none <21 be <1915 blameless
<934 God, <179 it be <175 <174 only <102 <479 and
<480 on the name of the Lord God <165

3:22 And even at this <1797 when thou <9220 have <1408 thy <421 the
<107 <107 the Lord thy God hath <1453 <9238 even then are they
<56 no more <58 in the <17215 of God, only <2313 to the
<986 <28 I have <1088 unto <26367

3:23 And now I have <11 the <17 <17 the Lord God hath <44
me.

3:24 And thus <15530 the <18018 They <108 <2006 as a bright <23785
<593 this <493 at the <315 day; <2010 they <16 be judged,
<146 man <62 to his <23613 whether they be <11786 or <5 they
be <12737

3:25 And if they be evil they are consigned to an <1264 view of <336
own <9329 and <18847 <77 doth <1389 them to <1389 from the
<1389 of the Lord into a <1213 of misery and <11095 torment, from
<13141 they can no more return; <1360 they have drunk <378 to
<42 own <16212

3:26 <2161 they have <14 out of the cup of the <8986 of God,
<57 <1462 <512 no more deny unto them than it <8 deny that Adam
<657 fall <2751 of his partaking of the <27806 <12010 <1525
<1423 <18 have <1423 on them no more <17683

3:27 And <62 torment is as a lake of fire and <11205 <1466 <11204
are <11205 and <6 <11205 <1471 up <399 and <1471 Thus
hath the Lord <198 me. <8335

<1306 <1306 4

4:1 And now, it came to pass that when king <3395 had made an end of
<6168 the <235 <101 had been <1962 unto him by the <1279 of
the <420 that he cast his eyes <3473 <2187 on the multitude, and
<550 they had <868 to the <1004 for the fear of the Lord had come
upon <759

4:2 And they had viewed <545 in <113 own <25063 state, even less
than the dust of the <2346 And they all <9118 aloud with one <3377
<3353 O have <16596 and apply the <553 <553 of <495 that we may
<827 forgiveness of our <827 and our <1151 may be purified; for we
<590 in <889 <575 the Son of God, who <2444 <1089 and <85
and all <5582 who <323 come down <843 the <672 of men.

4:3 And it came to pass that <1067 they had <381 <903 <146 the
<1816 of the Lord came upon <824 and they were <1329 with joy,
<2013 <1532 a <901 of <114 <74 and <8 <2789 of
conscience, <259 of the <8838 <487 <180 they had in <78
<101 who <274 <666 <385 to the <48 <14 king <206 had
<56 unto <159

4:4 And king <12 <1533 opened his <4411 and <3571 to <1525 unto
<65 <145 My friends and my <1547 my kindred and my <438 I
<1553 <25 call your <1554 that ye may hear and <1701 the
<5068 of my <56 <56 I <130 <37 unto you.

4:5 For <592 if the <614 of the <20278 of God at this time
has awakened you to a <1831 of your nothingness, and your worthless and
<260 state—

4:6 I say unto you, if ye have come to a <40 of the <40 of
God, and his <3407 <1465 and his <16842 and his patience, and his
<8047 <3766 the <200 of men; and <2064 the <745
<85 has been <4234 from the <25072 of the <24156 that <1095
<832 <1087 come to him that <166 put his <24952 in the <348 and
<9 be <4495 in <4494 his <2374 and <6448 in the
<196 even unto the end of his <9984 I mean the life of the <2675
body—

4:7 I say, that this is the man who <2263 <6506 <718 the
<76 <75 was <74 from the <74 of the <12021 for all
mankind, <13 ever were <6336 the fall of <873 or who are, or who
ever <186 be, even unto the end of the <8895

4:8 And this is the <1008 <1008 <109 <12096 And <1026 is none
<1020 <8 save this <45 hath been <272 of; <3353 are <15
any conditions <23 man can be <12022 <802 the <8 <19 I
have told you.

4:9 Believe in God; <396 that he is, and that he <394 all <1895
both in <399 and in <2856 <17 that he has all <205 and all
<212 both in <16 and in <16 <16 that man doth not
comprehend all the <823 <56 the Lord can comprehend.

4:10 And <9910 <21 that ye must <11781 of your sins and forsake
<346 and <1062 <2240 <889 God; and ask in sincerity of <18991
that he <347 forgive you; and now, if you <33 all <445 <48 see
that ye do <395

4:11 And <368 I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye have
come to the <316 of the <13733 of God, or if ye have <1907 of his
<327 and have tasted of his <1035 and have <480 a <480 of
your <481 <107 <19874 such <1381 <1381 joy in your <25642 even
so I <83 that ye <303 <2017 and <5215 <20476 in remembrance,
the <4011 of God, and your own <399 and his <50 and
<363 <363 you, unworthy creatures, and <126 <126
even in the <17374 of humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily,
and standing steadfastly in the <341 of that <69 is to <533 <4
was <255 by the <517 of the angel.

4:12 And <477 I say unto you that if ye do this ye <311 <81
<3379 and be <597 with the love of God, and <12 <93 a
<121 of your sins; and ye <23 grow in the <156 of the <156
of him that <277 you, or in the <13 of that <69 is just and
<2513

4:13 And ye will not have a mind to injure one <3820 but to live
peaceably, and to <2614 to <1019 man <634 to that <35 is his
due.

4:14 And ye will not <1880 your <515 that they go <19423 or
naked; <377 will ye <13 that they <2543 the laws of God, and
<6011 and quarrel one with <56 and <3420 the <1783 who is the
<15928 of sin, or who is the evil <3035 <59 hath been <163 of by
our <5389 he <4306 an <1352 to all <29795

4:15 But ye will <4311 them to walk in the ways of <9391 and soberness;
ye will <14 them to love one <60 and to <61 one <4398

4:16 And <608 ye <247 will succor <1788 that <1162 in need of
your succor; ye will <19524 of your substance unto him that
<1846 in need; and ye will not <117 that the beggar <1398 up his
petition to you in <10975 and turn him out to <16826

4:17 Perhaps thou <1283 say: The man has <4604 upon <10441 his
misery; <1135 I will stay my <13293 and will not give unto him of my
food, nor impart unto him of my <70 that he may not <2057 for
his punishments are just—

4:18 But I say unto you, O man, <1799 <2681 this the same hath
<404 <1215 to repent; and <579 he <2642 of that <182 he hath
done he <1587 forever, and hath no interest in the <5369 of God.

4:19 For <352 are we not all beggars? Do we not all depend upon the
same Being, even God, for all the <83 <44 we have, for both
food and raiment, and for <9038 and for <9038 and for all the <4166
<21 we have of <315 kind?

4:20 And <54 even at this <1439 ye have been <450 on his <5320
and begging for a <395 of your <1742 And has he <3232 that ye
have begged in vain? Nay; he has <11909 out his <1034 upon you, and
has <3310 that your <1094 <526 be <439 with joy, and has <11
that your <5956 <12 be stopped that ye <1282 not find <22502 so
<562 <158 was your joy.

4:21 And now, if God, who has <446 you, on whom you are dependent
for your <8244 and for all that ye have and are, doth <7028 unto you
<8551 ye ask that is right, in <9401 <10293 that ye <493
receive, O <12496 how ye <3955 to <251 of the <166 that ye have
one to <351

4:22 And if ye <2173 the man who <322 up his <321 to you for
your <28 that he <16851 not, and <21701 him, how much more just
will be your condemnation for withholding your <19969 <193 doth
not <26416 to you but to God, to whom also your life belongeth; and yet
ye put up no petition, nor <793 of the <10391 <29 thou hast <3369

4:23 I say unto you, wo be unto that man, for his <69 <110
<69 with him; and now, I say <795 <795 unto <443 who are rich as
pertaining to the <11 of this <953

4:24 And <852 I say unto the <24528 ye who have not and yet have
sufficient, that ye <4855 from day to day; I mean all you who deny the
beggar, <1261 ye have not; I <778 that ye say in your <256 <8647 I
give not <17 I have not, but if I had I <21 give.

4:25 And now, if ye say this in your <29 ye <56 guiltless,
<19618 ye are condemned; and your <166 is just for ye covet
that <140 ye have not received.

4:26 And now, for the sake of <126 <115 <17 I have <626 unto
you—that is, for the sake of retaining a <365 of your sins from
day to day, that ye may walk guiltless <971 God—I <80 that ye
<342 <273 of your <176 to the <143 <417 man <732 to
that <48 he hath, such as <10376 the <721 clothing the <20152
visiting the sick and administering to <1411 relief, both spiritually
and temporally, <29 to <9 wants.

4:27 And see that all <87 <87 are done in <27951 and order; for it
is not requisite that a man <68 run <15073 than he has strength. And
<218 it is <5920 that he <15 be diligent, that <1287 he
<1287 win the prize; <1716 all <44 must be done in order.

4:28 And I <112 that ye <28 <991 that <609 <1536 you
borroweth of his neighbor <11 <7703 the <317 that he borroweth,
<91 as he doth agree, or else thou <689 <4670 sin; and <7447
thou <7 <633 thy <27 to <11 sin <9736

4:29 And finally, I <4070 tell you all the <69 <1233 ye may
<20 sin; for <1244 are divers ways and <17800 even so many that I
<25 <5399 <1137

4:30 But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not <17270 <4902
and your <21011 and your <3214 and your deeds, and <19331 the
<3163 of God, and <1399 in the <1057 of what ye have <2986
<2438 the <7424 of our <1425 even unto the end of your <4244 ye
must <808 And now, O man, <143 and <426 not.

<1834 <1834 5

5:1 And now, it came to pass that when king <1616 had thus <312 to
his <1601 he sent <173 <1270 <21451 to know of his <2125 if they
<12058 the <1598 <288 he had <24 unto <120

5:2 And they all <1792 with one <1791 <1645 Yea, we <1281 all the
<25 <25 thou hast <25 unto us; and <941 we know of <297 <6310
and truth, <436 of the <710 of the Lord Omnipotent, <24 has
<10398 a <3009 <14833 in us, or in our <2559 that we have no more
disposition to do evil, but to do good <11885

5:3 And we, ourselves, <52 <1527 the infinite <1252 of God, and
the manifestations of his <2371 have <731 views of that <54 is to
<7406 and were it expedient, we <752 <10448 of all <14163

5:4 And it is the <201 <24 we have had on the <270 <7 our king
has <111 unto us that has <992 us to this <49 <11867 <286
we do <2733 with such <790 <10 joy.

5:5 And we are <2409 to <13237 into a <10981 with our God to do his
<4593 and to be <18855 to his <269 in all <57 that he
<667 <18619 us, all the <1801 of our <9502 that we may not <11042
upon <18967 a <3414 <2199 as has been <78 by the angel,
that we may not <2578 out of the cup of the <2186 of God.

5:6 And now, <493 are the <221 <112 king <272 <11295 of <5517
and <1096 he said unto <14115 Ye have <44 the <18 that I
desired; and the <98 <25 ye have made is a <2993 covenant.

5:7 And now, <244 of the <18 <18 ye have made ye <100 be
<3103 the <1305 of <2042 his <5634 and his daughters; for <1012
this day he hath <581 begotten you; for ye say that your <694
are changed <241 <201 on his <3108 <539 ye are born of him
and have <2680 his sons and his daughters.

5:8 And <5509 this head ye are made <29861 and <488 is no <1746 head
<215 ye can be made free. <25062 is no <12 name <2783 <12
<1762 <14100 <50 I <577 that ye <566 take upon you the
name of <93 all you that have <23809 into the <114 with God
that ye <22 be <226 unto the end of your lives.

5:9 And it <129 come to pass that <616 <1225 this <8 be <2548
at the <13088 hand of God, for he <12 know the name by <159 he is
called; for he <12 be <160 by the name of <3092

5:10 And now it <15 come to <29015 that <47 <6 not take upon
him the name of <2147 must be <31 by some <117 <162 <112 he
findeth <1343 on the left hand of God.

5:11 And I <127 that ye <105 <3711 <431 that this is the name
that I said I <13 give unto you that <4876 <6 be <6488 out,
<1322 it be <214 transgression; <49 take heed that ye do not
transgress, that the name be not <22 out of your <13881

5:12 I say unto you, I <60 that ye <41 <60 to <1661 the name
<5747 <1667 in your <523 that ye are not <156 on the left hand
of God, but that ye hear and know the <9275 by <158 ye <132 be
called, and <98 the name by <11 he <11 call you.

5:13 For how <3283 a man the <1603 whom he has not served, and who
is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his
heart?

5:14 And <888 doth a man take an ass <53 <4855 to his <21059
and keep him? I say unto you, Nay; he will not even <1566 that he
<73 feed <708 his <6184 but will <8801 him <9815 and cast him out.
I say unto you, that even so <22 it be <23 you if ye know not the
name by <57 ye are called.

5:15 <2698 I <167 that ye <167 be steadfast and immovable,
<165 abounding in good <2790 that <358 the Lord God <708
may seal you his, that you may be <622 to <3983 that ye may have
<4475 <396 and <12228 <2244 <239 the <2107 and <2105
and <13907 and <2710 of him who <1410 all <2133 in <2115 and in
<2532 who is God <4797 all. <2684

<850 <850 6

6:1 And now, king <572 <6965 it was <713 <2533 <2504
finished <2680 to the <849 that he <95 take the <7485 of all
<1303 who had <446 into a <446 with God to keep his
<12045

6:2 And it came to pass that <507 was not one <7611 <334 it were
<3038 <3038 but who had <35 into the <35 and had <9741
upon them the name of <431

6:3 And <236 it came to pass that when king <87 had made an end
of all <673 <122 and had <5896 his son <112 to be a <4807
and a king over his <101 and had <560 him all the charges
<1010 the <22832 and also had <3493 <22335 to <1876 the
<21 that <1171 they <1170 hear and know the <776 of God,
and to stir them up in <4256 of the oath <250 they had <24641 he
dismissed the <2811 and they returned, <1283 one, <1163 to
<958 families, to <3 own houses.

6:4 And <83 <2640 to <7822 in his father’s <9161 And he <9 to
<10 in the thirtieth year of his age, <8720 in the whole, <2859 four
<8697 and seventy-six <8699 from the time that Lehi left <11409

6:5 And king <143 <9212 <7706 <17 and he <16824

6:6 And it came to pass that king <63 did walk in the ways of the
<1140 and did <1165 his <11563 and his statutes, and did keep his
<128 in all <904 <1689 he <2977 him.

6:7 And king <37 did <1263 his <1116 that they <277 till the
<2899 And he <506 himself, did till the <324 that <170 he <170
not <791 burdensome to his <181 that he <10 do <149 to that
<167 his <4900 had done in all <1034 And <287 was no <7853
<441 all his <52 for the <9409 of <114 years.

<66 <361 7

7:1 And now, it came to pass that <360 king <16 had had <7864
<2869 for the <31 of <31 years, he was <9068 to know <262
the <46 who went up to <4118 in the land of Lehi-Nephi, or in the
city of Lehi-Nephi; for his <20 had <1299 <3717 from them from the
time they left the land of <9496 <701 they wearied him with
<252 teasings.

7:2 And it came to pass that king <75 <5568 that sixteen of <18
<9110 men <133 go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi to inquire <77
<16 <8635

7:3 And it came to pass that on the <7357 they started to go up,
<478 with them one Ammon, he <2262 a <43 and <1260 man, and a
descendant of <79 and he was also <43 leader.

7:4 And now, they knew not the <11745 they <228 travel in the
<9229 to go up to the land of <129 <1100 they wandered
many days in the <7109 even forty days did they wander.

7:5 And when they had <21 <14 days they came to a hill, <241 is
north of the land of Shilom, and <242 they <6703 <72 tents.

7:6 And Ammon took <210 of his <3033 and <14 <575 were <9187
Helem, and Hem, and they went down into the land of <8940

7:7 And <1126 they met the king of the <214 who were in the land of
<7753 and in the land of Shilom; and they were surrounded by the
king’s guard, and were taken, and were bound, and were <13555 to
prison.

7:8 And it came to pass when they had been in prison two days they were
<2743 <732 <1807 the <5666 and <91 bands were loosed; and they
<4613 <12 the <12 and were permitted, or <32184 commanded, that
they <183 <5741 the questions <142 he <6 ask <1526

7:9 And he said unto <1282 <6146 I am Limhi, the son of Noah, who was
the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the land of <7192 to inherit
this <5366 <43 was the land of <72 <2530 who was made a king by
the <981 of the <3773

7:10 And now, I <4858 to know the <493 <1224 ye were so bold as to
come near the <6856 of the city, when I, <6416 was with my guards
<25074 the gate?

7:11 And now, for this <35 have I <2318 that ye <112 be
preserved, that I <376 <368 of you, or else I <13 have <2305
that my <38 <7 have put you to <20763 Ye are permitted to speak.

7:12 And now, when <274 saw that he was <15 to <6767 he went
<4649 and bowed <1196 <183 the <5641 and rising <202 he <13028 O
<191 I am very <20532 <15 God this day that I am yet alive, and
am <37 to speak; and I will endeavor to <3324 with boldness;

7:13 For I am assured that if ye had <2962 me ye <1010 not have
<113 that I <93 have worn <842 bands. For I am <454 and am a
<448 of <7172 and have come up out of the land of <215
to <134 <502 our <375 whom Zeniff <290 up out of that
<7296

7:14 And now, it came to pass that <621 Limhi had <580 the <1548 of
<52 he was <1660 glad, and <119 Now, I know of a <1789 that
my <8914 who were in the land of <58 are yet alive. And now, I
will <4880 and on the <553 I will <218 that my <415 <1143
<1705 <2010

7:15 For <432 we are in bondage to the <7712 and are taxed with
a tax <311 is <6648 to be borne. And now, <23 our <61 will
<7802 us out of our bondage, or out of the <5736 of the <34
and we will be <338 slaves; for it is <6080 that we be <6781 to the
<10042 than to pay tribute to the king of the <8892

7:16 And now, king <137 <848 his <287 that they <196 no more
bind <276 nor his <173 but <304 that they <13 go to the hill
<88 was <583 of <580 and <1768 <63 <86 into the <365 that
<857 they <338 eat, and <29443 and rest <3788 from the <12686
of <21 journey; for they had <251 many <3732 they had <5
<4891 <4890 and fatigue.

7:17 And now, it came to pass on the <175 that king <84 sent a
<7602 <875 all his <901 that <55 they <55 <7664
<52 <6079 to the <7593 to hear the <240 <83 he <91
<327 unto <527

7:18 And it came to pass that when they had <7633 <30
<31 that he <4588 unto them in this <29221 <2067 O ye, my <52
lift up your <12726 and be comforted; for <209 the time is at <2940
or is not far <5112 when we <255 no <6065 be in subjection to our
<5950 <14927 our many strugglings, <74 have been in <12819
yet I <3625 <740 <5558 an effectual struggle to be made.

7:19 <1412 lift up your heads, and <3249 and put your <23 in
God, in that God who was the God of <30041 and <20830 and Jacob; and
<1057 that God who <392 the <1883 of <24002 out of the land of
Egypt, and <233 that they <142 walk <1419 the Red Sea on dry
<11925 and fed them with manna that they <173 not <2260 in the
wilderness; and many more <1129 did he do for <170

7:20 And <1335 that same God has <59 our <5828 out of the land
of <7693 and has kept and <6737 his <399 even <5843 now; and
<163 it is <1979 of our <22034 and <5115 that he has
<35 us into bondage.

7:21 And ye all are <7035 this day, that <735 who was made king
over this <210 he <990 over-zealous to <737 the land of his
<733 <956 <11 <14427 by the cunning and craftiness of king
Laman, who <1019 <1444 into a treaty with king <40 and <9
yielded up into his <434 the possessions of a part of the <777 or
even the city of <1136 and the city of <903 and the land <4192
about—

7:22 And all this he did, for the sole <15732 of <28465 this <126
into <267 or into <110 And <128 we at this time do pay
<467 to the king of the <496 to the amount of one half of our
corn, and our barley, and even all our grain of <1434 <12977 and one
half of the increase of our <12995 and our herds; and even one half of
all we have or <10313 the king of the <9396 doth exact of us, or
our <2045

7:23 And now, is not this <588 to be borne? And is not <5954 our
affliction, great? Now <95 how <2328 reason we have to mourn.

7:24 Yea, I say unto you, <15 are the reasons <379 we have to mourn;
for <4335 how many of our <540 have been <10341 and <525 <4288
has been spilt in <3395 and all <268 of <31712

7:25 For if this <161 had not <4105 into <5232 the Lord
<804 not have <547 that this <56 evil <363 come upon <334 But
<81 they <16 not <7645 unto his <21722 but <439 arose
<6350 <545 <2592 even so much that they did shed <64 <10
<17884

7:26 And a <16163 of the Lord have they slain; yea, a <7589 man of
God, who told them of <93 <5465 and <4625 and <10082
of many <401 <120 are to <3754 yea, even the <2698 of <1741

7:27 And <108 he said unto them that <2161 was the God, the <5477
of all <1739 and said that he <101 take upon him the image of man,
and it <11 be the <9 <869 <51 man was <1887 in the
<5496 or in <2195 <2777 he said that man was <14 <19 the
<23 of God, and that God <32 come down <118 the <526 of men,
and take upon him <23039 and <6744 and go <1031 upon the face of the
earth—

7:28 And now, <95 he said <260 they did put him to <5610 and many
more <125 did they do <77 <480 down the <2524 of God upon <199
<616 who wondereth that they are in <871 and that they are
<8456 with sore afflictions?

7:29 For <220 the Lord hath <969 I will not <3698 my <253 in the
day of <186 <2261 but I will hedge up <7 ways that they
<6613 not; and <8 doings <706 be as a <20855 block <1115
<65

7:30 And <598 he <29469 If my <42 <20 sow <22064 they <4
reap the <33079 <8137 in the whirlwind; and the effect <7 is
poison.

7:31 And <1164 he <31 If my <31 <27 sow <31 they <4
reap the east wind, <126 bringeth immediate <13315

7:32 And now, <104 the <23607 of the Lord is <10348 and ye are
<125 and <23313

7:33 But if ye will turn to the Lord with full <541 of <16273 and
put your <768 in him, and <3846 him with all <8655 of <22604 if ye
do <202 he <2762 <1803 to his own will and <13189 <1056 you
out of <568

<1697 <1788 8

8:1 And it came to pass that <278 king <946 had made an end of
<2152 to his <686 for he <909 many <240 unto them and only a
few of them have I <2421 in this <31011 he told his <140 all the
<23 <1230 <198 <498 who were in the land of <10828

8:2 And he <836 that <1076 <329 <3935 up <211 the <2052 and
rehearse unto them all that had happened unto <34 <34 from the
time that <1268 went up out of the land even <806 the time that he
<1376 came up out of the <1281

8:3 And he also rehearsed unto them the last <1037 <210 king <2041
had <5228 <516 and explained them to the <93 of king <1560 so
that they <896 <4715 all the <25 <25 he spake.

8:4 And it came to pass that <155 he had done all <192 that king
<162 <2154 the <102 and <112 that they <112 <3324 <723
one unto his own house.

8:5 And it came to pass that he <23 that the <8936 <54 <10340
the <10590 of his <74 from the time that they left the land of
<1417 <43 be <435 <155 <1377 that he <85 read <370

8:6 Now, as soon as <174 had read the <10443 the king <24014 of him
to know if he <3107 <11513 <11232 and <19 told him that he
<10 not.

8:7 And the king said unto him: Being <22446 for the afflictions of my
<266 I <88 that <1876 and <1849 of my <84 <73 take a
<11047 into the <1905 that <1231 they <77 find the land of
<91 that we <9 appeal unto our <235 to <336 us out of
<336

8:8 And they were lost in the <1957 for the <2110 of many <3106
yet they were <3530 and <2726 not the land of <1483 but
<11135 to this <980 <995 traveled in a land <626 many <11834
<9 <11596 a land <172 was <32525 with <11531 of men, and of
beasts, and was also <12 with ruins of buildings of <214 <937
<27 <27 a land <27 had been peopled with a <114 who were
as <13258 as the hosts of <27362

8:9 And for a <5451 that the <382 that they had said are true
they have <215 twenty-four <239 <40 are <4063 with <9878
and they are of pure gold.

8:10 And <535 <1249 they have <24 breastplates, <23 are large,
and they are of <12007 and of <13178 and are perfectly sound.

8:11 And <619 they have <26 swords, the hilts <604 have
perished, and the blades <7 were cankered with rust; and <897 is
no one in the land that is able to <262 the <9962 or the
<11778 that are on the <11846 <6924 I said unto thee: Canst
thou translate?

8:12 And I say unto thee again: Knowest thou of any one that can
<19 For I am <2325 that <1771 <7154 <270 be translated
into our language; for, <14509 they will give us a <4603 of a
<28743 of the <178 who have been <14569 from <5540 <30
<31 <18683 or, <25 they will give us a <25 of this very
<23 who have been destroyed; and I am <56 to know the <1733 of
<541 <708

8:13 Now <372 said unto him: I can <31555 tell <5725 O <1902 of a
man that can translate the <14459 for he has wherewith that he can
look, and <13 all <68 that are of <29699 date; and it is a
gift from God. And the <250 are <3158 interpreters, and no man can
look in them <2785 he be <2140 lest he <132 look for that he
<4244 not and he <10 <3725 And <3200 is <1732 to look in
<587 the same is <40 seer.

8:14 And <269 the king of the <124 who are in the land of
<386 is the man that is <35 to do <157 <1061 and who has
this high gift from God.

8:15 And the king said that a seer is <23506 than a prophet.

8:16 And <151 said that a seer is a revelator and a <1160 <19577 and
a gift <333 is <27 can no man <4503 <114 he <100 <1325 the
<7565 of God, <16 no man can; yet a man may have <1231 <13 <2854
him from God.

8:17 But a seer can know of <161 <27 are past, and also of <7
<8 are to <1189 and by them <948 all <11 be revealed, or,
rather, <8 <28516 <8 be made manifest, and hidden <6 <9
come to <27099 and <7 <31 are not <2104 <11 be made <4 by
<173 and also <14 <10 be made <10 by them <20 <4233 <637
not be known.

8:18 Thus God has provided a <5274 that man, <1686 <4472 <606 work
<2575 <31395 <1581 he <6147 a <107 <14043 to his <8520
beings.

8:19 And now, when <162 had made an end of <934 <201 <804 the
king <14226 <12506 and gave <8432 to God, <1844 Doubtless a
<37 <21867 is <766 <9182 <21 <10487 and <3 interpreters
were doubtless <5381 for the <1030 of unfolding all such <9004
to the <1249 of men.

8:20 O how <9849 are the <22501 of the <2895 and how long doth he
<3291 with his <8934 yea, and how <6924 and impenetrable are the
understandings of the <38 of men; for they will not seek <3222
<5003 do they <2412 that she <239 rule over them!

8:21 Yea, they are as a wild flock <161 fleeth from the shepherd, and
scattereth, and are driven, and are devoured by the <14699 of the
<32070

<1091 <1091 9

9:1 I, <1728 <696 been <967 in all the <580 of the <12934
and <12 had a <505 of the land of <2630 or of the land of our
fathers’ <8400 <23603 and <20 been sent as a spy <765 the
<1647 that I <217 spy out <517 forces, that our army <8 come
upon them and <14714 them—but when I saw that <97 was good <29
them I was <549 that they <123 not be <13241

9:2 <1379 I contended with my <863 in the <848 for I
<1587 that our <3231 <24 make a <1834 with <3912 but he <1855 an
austere and a <14839 man <462 that I <19 be <1576 but I
was rescued by the shedding of much blood; for <3046 <13484 <6252
<7801 and <13174 <5 <11969 <1138 the <438 <4320 of our
army was <13713 in the <1994 and we <3228 <3375 of us that
were spared, to the land of <951 to relate that tale to <128
<23593 and <4 children.

9:3 And yet, I <81 <1947 to <1947 the land of our <1946
collected as many as were <131 to go up to <494 the <943 and
<2973 <1410 on our <1012 into the <129 to go up to the <8633
but we were <1389 with <9969 and sore afflictions; for we were slow
to <3728 the Lord our God.

9:4 <12775 <1185 many days’ <14964 in the <39 we
<2924 our <9601 in the <7769 <12823 our <182 were <1811 <209 was
near to the land of our <10215

9:5 And it came to pass that I went <81 with four of my men into the
<2383 in unto the <761 that I <259 know of the <4306 of the
<11 and that I <12 know if I <4 go in with my <693 and <126
the land in peace.

9:6 And I went in unto the <31 and he <15253 with me that I <31
<26 the land of <2070 and the land of Shilom.

9:7 And he also <262 that his <48 <263 <13161 out of the
<177 and I and my <12 went into the land that we <41 <40 it.

9:8 And we <3452 to <22428 <14217 and to repair the <2863 of the
<116 yea, even the <8 of the city of <65 and the city of
<66

9:9 And we <34 to till the <2300 yea, even with all <7434 of
seeds, with seeds of <2104 and of wheat, and of <2107 and with neas,
and with sheum, and with <18 of all <26 of fruits; and we did
<19005 to multiply and <1734 in the <1475

9:10 Now it was the <2244 and the <2245 of king <2244 to <2592
my <119 into <1802 that he <2241 up the land that we <123
<124 it.

9:11 <1094 it came to <4120 that <283 we had <12848 in the land for
the <1300 of twelve <3555 that king Laman <111 to grow uneasy, lest by
any <739 my <52 <183 wax <3313 in the <182 and that they <765
not overpower them and <71 them into <1350

9:12 Now they were a lazy and an idolatrous <672 <764 they were
<397 to <23 us into <92 that they <86 glut <2596 with
the <2679 of our hands; yea, that they <13 <24291 <13 upon the
<2252 of our fields.

9:13 <105 it came to pass that king <90 <90 to stir up his
<86 that they <88 <11658 with my <61 <61 <1246 <16
to be wars and <2147 in the <177

9:14 For, in the thirteenth year of my <3721 in the land of <665 away
on the south of the land of <2781 when my <49 were watering and
<5045 <525 <4068 and tilling <4 <14567 a <1392 host of
<674 came upon them and <61 to slay <927 and to take off <20
<25 and the corn of <7 <106

9:15 Yea, and it came to pass that they fled, all that were not
overtaken, even into the city of <76 and did call upon me for
protection.

9:16 And it came to pass that I did arm them with bows, and with
arrows, with <1395 and with cimeters, and with clubs, and with
slings, and with all <328 of <14584 <535 we <237 invent, and I and
my <119 did go <2158 <681 the <108 to <14724

9:17 Yea, in the <9822 of the Lord did we go <20 to <11920 <22
the <13768 for I and my <34 did cry mightily to the Lord that he
<766 <1635 us out of the <2588 of our <2808 for we were <6506
to a <3964 of the deliverance of our <602

9:18 And God did hear our <24866 and did <3432 our prayers; and we did
go <65 in his might; yea, we did go <8 <71 the <2572 and
in one day and a <16375 we did slay <1731 thousand and forty-three; we
did slay them even <796 we had <10695 them out of our <278

9:19 And I, <3394 with mine own <12562 did help to bury <227 <33753
And <1332 to our <1096 <16169 and lamentation, two <4000 and
seventy-nine of our <710 were slain.

<995 <995 10

10:1 And it came to pass that we <705 <281 to <11794 the <5830
and we <9 <9 to <488 the land in <677 And I <1826 that
<364 <371 be <218 of war made of <1729 <1729 that <1823 I <414
have <13 for my <190 <128 the time the <223 <24 come
up <42 to war <12 my <3527

10:2 And I set <3176 <2762 <4095 the <499 that the <25 <37
not come upon us <27 unawares and <1023 us; and thus I did guard my
<49 and my <363 and keep them from <8992 into the <234 of our
<14158

10:3 And it came to pass that we did <927 the land of our <2941
for many <3988 yea, for the <585 of <14311 and two <4028

10:4 And I did <1617 that the men <101 till the <705 and <15787 all
<351 of <2796 and all <5 of <18884 of <135 kind.

10:5 And I did <30 that the women <30 spin, and toil, and <32795
and work all <27 of fine linen, yea, and cloth of <31 <166 that
we <129 <25693 our nakedness; and thus we did <721 in the land—thus
we did have <4086 <4085 in the land for the <93 of <93 and two
<94

10:6 And it came to pass that king <600 <25006 and his son <237 to
<570 in his <4300 And he <9 to stir his <170 up in <8790
<211 my <611 <611 they <14 to <19809 for war, and to come
up to <439 <17 my <228

10:7 But I had sent my spies out <231 <231 the land of Shemlon, that
I <104 discover <345 preparations, that I <6 <225 <31 <591
that they <7 not come upon my <63 and <244 <2189

10:8 And it came to pass that they came up upon the <3430 of the land
of <653 with <43 <640 hosts, men armed with <571 and with
<571 and with <572 and with <572 and with stones, and with
slings; and they had <27 <3344 shaved that they were <6441 and they
were girded with a leathern <16091 <96 <17 loins.

10:9 And it came to pass that I <388 that the <233 and <1476 of
my <93 <239 be hid in the <1268 and I also <19 that all
my old men that <624 bear <17287 and also all my <8815 men that were
able to bear <13 <33 <3469 <829 <3437 to go to <176
<146 the <615 and I did <1198 them in <74 ranks, <274 man
<2589 to his age.

10:10 And it came to pass that we did go up to <35 <34 the
<35 and I, even I, in my old age, did go up to <17 <17
the <3636 And it came to pass that we did go up in the <693 of
the Lord to <707

10:11 Now, the <468 knew <4370 <2588 the <1631 nor the
<22 of the <7 <284 they depended upon <88 own <5845
Yet they were a <998 <2374 as to the <21 of men.

10:12 They were a <16310 and <16310 and a blood-thirsty <20
<6232 in the tradition of <36 <1397 <786 is this—Believing
that they were <660 out of the land of <11953 <2932 of the
<3404 of <22 <22 and that they were wronged in the
<1365 by <12 <3728 and they were also <12 <9620 crossing
the sea;

10:13 And <2251 that they were <15 <15 in the land of <27
<1626 <1626 <1121 they had crossed the sea, and all this <58
that <15677 was more <8954 in <7214 the <4644 of the
Lord—therefore he was <11673 of the <135 for the Lord <3940 his
<28513 and <17671 <382 and he took the lead of <50 <1487 in the
<13546

10:14 And his <735 were wroth with him <54 they <8276 not
the dealings of the <9359 they were also <16 with him upon the <30524
<20 they <8301 <40 <5481 <235 the <11776

10:15 And <110 they were <23 with him when they had arrived in the
<10188 <699 <28 they said that he had <4947 the ruling of the
<364 out of <40 <1167 and they <10738 to kill him.

10:16 And <43 they were <43 with him <34 he <14550 into the
<184 as the Lord had <1436 him, and took the <2249 <225
were <11659 on the <2478 of <12452 for they said that he robbed
<509

10:17 And thus they have <1842 <62 <434 that they <399 hate
<156 and that they <7 <15785 <6 and that they <6 rob and
plunder <9 and do all they <438 to <549 <1771 <324 they
have an <5163 <16628 <7102 the <39 of <4518

10:18 For this very <721 has king <1392 by his cunning, and lying
craftiness, and his fair promises, <3657 me, that I have <2520
this my <139 up into this <156 that they may <53 <53 yea, and
we have <3439 <2054 many <1388 in the <994

10:19 And now I, <1949 <292 <1918 told all <18 <2155 unto my
<39 <417 the <1045 I did stimulate them to go to <460
with <127 <10966 putting <3 <3110 in the <250 <4796 we did
<1331 with <119 face to face.

10:20 And it came to pass that we did <5362 them <926 out of our <1782
and we slew them with a <1047 slaughter, even so many that we did not
<1881 <192

10:21 And it came to pass that we <2775 <36 to our own <121 and
my <90 <9 <780 to tend <78 <961 and to till <5 ground.

10:22 And now I, <1879 old, did <12266 the <1067 upon one of my <12789

11:1 And now it came to pass that <3113 <15337 the <40 upon
<4626 one of his <42 <244 Noah <72 to <874 in his stead; and
he did not walk in the ways of his <8415

11:2 For <1179 he did not keep the <475 of God, but he did
walk <210 the desires of his own <17662 And he had many <1993 and
concubines. And he did <282 his <131 to <6372 sin, and do that
<368 was <26426 in the <8360 of the <448 Yea, and they did <19
<25690 and all <1017 of wickedness.

11:3 And he laid a tax of one fifth part of all they possessed, a <7
part of <172 gold and of <4 <7016 and a <12 part of <7 ziff,
and of <5 <2865 and of <4 <2872 and <3 iron; and a <19
part of <8 fatlings; and also a <9 part of all <9 grain.

11:4 And all this did he take to <10259 <5223 and his <117 and his
concubines; and also his <15936 and <27 <11 and <3 <10
thus he had <6040 the <12166 of the <12166

<2193 and <6 new ones in <36 stead, such as were <27065 up
in the <26925 of <12 <5848

11:6 Yea, and thus they were supported in <13 laziness, and in <4
idolatry, and in <5 <26267 by the taxes <188 king Noah had put
upon his <1116 thus did the <208 <11026 <4631 to <108
<3918

11:7 Yea, and they also <16228 idolatrous, <602 they were <497
by the vain and <19400 <2556 of the king and priests; for they did
<4427 <12 <472 unto <401

11:8 And it came to pass that king Noah <33084 many elegant and spacious
buildings; and he ornamented them with fine work of <16264 and of all
<256 of <16278 <2807 of <7250 and of <234 and of iron, and of
<649 and of <237 and of copper;

11:9 And he also <49 him a <48 palace, and a <25839 in the <34392
<21310 all of <130 was of fine wood and was <62 with gold and

fine work <2664 the <2119 of the <11846 of fine <93 and of <305
and of brass.

11:11 And the seats <59 were set apart for the high <276 <8
were <5830 all the <3951 seats, he did ornament with pure gold; and he

11:12 And it came to pass that he <37 a <11928 near the temple; yea, a
very high <14920 even so high that he <776 <3675 upon the top <3247
and overlook the land of <1312 and also the land of <1365 <95
was possessed by the <1177 and he <28 even look over all the
land <1388 about.

11:13 And it came to pass that he <108 many <3400 to be <71 in
the land <4408 and he <13 a <696 <80 to be <14 on the hill
<1379 of the land <65 <59 had been a resort for the <848 of
<1067 at the time they fled out of the <737 and thus he did do with
the <7530 <29 he <25122 by the taxation of his <144

11:14 And it came to pass that he <27729 his <8108 upon his <27288 and
he <11400 his time in riotous <30662 with his <494 and his <494
and so did also his <480 <11769 <199 time with harlots.

11:15 And it came to pass that he <21922 vineyards <137 <1429 in the
<81 and he <113 wine-presses, and made wine in abundance; and
<718 he <438 a wine-bibber, and also his <83

11:16 And it came to pass that the <1319 <737 to come in upon his
<1281 upon <14463 numbers, and to slay them in <71 fields, and <270
they were tending <8 flocks.

11:17 And king Noah sent <1829 <73 <73 the land to keep them off;
but he did not send a <15762 <12493 and the <55 came upon
them and <25115 <324 and drove many of <42 <2299 out of the <104
thus the <21 <76 to <1010 <18 and to exercise <17 <1061
upon <518

11:18 And it came to pass that king Noah sent his <14053 <1217 <25
and they were <1367 <12722 or they <50 them back for a <15481
<900 they <942 <15637 in <42 spoil.

11:19 And now, <588 of this <283 victory they were <658 up in the
<658 of <22 <19951 they did boast in <6 own <21427 <16122
that <6 <29202 <344 <372 <60 <14041 of the <353 and
thus they did <11754 and did <27148 in <4378 and the <2912 of the
<4516 of <28 <1420 and this <58 of the <4496 of <9
king and priests.

11:20 And it came to pass that <2048 was a man <3007 them <9027 name
was Abinadi; and he went <2171 <11 <123 and <153 to <20726
<3223 <5611 thus <9223 the <1411 and thus hath he <1289 me,
saying, Go <23159 and say unto this <246 thus <19 the Lord—Wo be
unto this <9 for I have seen <71 <4568 and <3
<12019 and <4 <36784 and <3425 they <7694 I will <16222
them in mine anger.

11:21 And <16 they <16 and turn to the Lord <27 God, <1017 I
will <2304 them into the <2069 of <12 enemies; yea, and they <3377
be <1265 into bondage; and they <8 be <27633 by the hand of
<21 <2089

11:22 And it <16 come to pass that they <6 know that I am the Lord
<22 God, and am a jealous God, <7557 the <1612 of my <381

11:23 And it <27 come to pass that <87 this <854 <88 and turn
unto the Lord <34 God, they <18 be <74 into <74 and none
<8 <95 <176 <24 it be the Lord the <28157 God.

11:24 Yea, and it <18 come to pass that when they <7 cry unto me I
will be slow to hear <47 cries; yea, and I will <3382 them that they
be <3077 by <14 <117

11:25 And <54 they <77 in sackcloth and ashes, and cry <2472
to the Lord <21 God, I will not hear <6 <10451 <3393 will I
<82 them out of <10 <3112 and thus <237 the <256 and
thus hath he <257 me.

11:26 Now it came to pass that when Abinadi had <7172 <1422 <761 unto
them they were <1583 with him, and <1599 to take away his <31160 but
the Lord <9300 him out of <53 <14586

11:27 Now when king Noah had <1721 of the <38 <660 <44 had
<45 unto the <301 he was also wroth; and he <4699 Who is Abinadi,
that I and my <197 <829 be <10551 of him, or who is the <95 that
<166 <2850 upon my <17 such <462 affliction?

11:28 I <7328 you to <15 <52 <24134 that I may slay him, for
he has said <105 <1055 that he <885 stir up my <33 to <34425 one
with <8473 and to <2344 <2833 <414 my <1118 <664 I
will slay him.

11:29 Now the eyes of the <29 were blinded; <18 they <1780
<124 <1781 <504 the <114 of <98 and they <147 from that
time <17144 to take him. And king Noah <23 his <770 <22 the
word of the <106 and he did not <240 of his evil doings.

<1472 <1472 12

12:1 And it came to pass that <1421 the <2358 of two <1648 that <119
came <91 them in disguise, that they knew him not, and <512 to
<7548 <14 <343 <514 Thus has the Lord <252 me,
saying—Abinadi, go and <14 unto this my <199 for they have
<81 <103 <103 <81 my <5118 they have <31648 not of <10
evil doings; <662 I will <503 them in my <29495 yea, in my
fierce <164 will I <13 them in <23 <437 and abominations.

12:2 Yea, wo be unto this generation! And the Lord said unto me:
Stretch <598 thy hand and <69 <81 Thus <338 the <137 it
<243 come to pass that this generation, <651 of <43 iniquities,
<12 be <454 into <3105 and <6 be <406 on the cheek; yea,
and <9 be <755 by men, and <6 be <3609 and the vultures of the
air, and the dogs, yea, and the wild <4453 <18 devour <44 <26098

12:3 And it <10 come to pass that the life of king Noah <10 be
valued even as a garment in a hot furnace; for he <14 know that I am
the <1591

12:4 And it <14 come to pass that I will <20165 this my <286 with
sore <13540 yea, with <3577 and with pestilence; and I will
<1641 that they <28 howl all the day long.

12:5 Yea, and I will <17 that they <17 have <28146 lashed upon
<97 backs; and they <10 be <127 <1256 like a dumb ass.

12:6 And it <14 come to pass that I will send <188 hail <268 <268
and it <15 <78 <1951 and they <5 also be <171 with the east
wind; and insects <11 pester <51 land <4531 and <153 <5 <1630

12:7 And they <15 be <25 with a <456 pestilence—and all this
will I do <220 of <23 <263 and <263

12:8 And it <25 come to pass that <621 they <381 I will <33346
<1008 them from off the face of the <9328 yet they <23 leave a
<4847 behind <89 and I will <13914 them for <1391 <32742 <556
<17 <2962 the <1046 yea, even this will I do that I may <2680
the <5779 of this <189 to <25 nations. And many <517 did
<414 <316 <374 this <778

12:9 And it came to pass that they were <30751 with him; and they took
him and <16614 him bound <179 the <3682 and said unto the king:
<946 we have <334 a man <15 thee who has <5488 evil
<2093 thy <433 and <367 that God will <115 <1115

12:10 And he also prophesieth evil <19 thy <7354 and <19 that
thy life <107 be as a <312 in a furnace of <21594

12:11 And <2299 he <22 that thou <8316 be as a stalk, even as a dry
stalk of the field, <143 is run over by the <4137 and trodden <7831
foot.

12:12 And <36 he <36 thou <35 be as the blossoms of a thistle,
which, when it is <35226 ripe, if the wind bloweth, it is <306 <287
upon the face of the <2224 And he pretendeth the Lord hath <752 it.
And he <43 all this <99 come upon thee <245 thou <21604 and this
<268 of thine iniquities.

12:13 And now, O <168 what <289 evil hast thou <20538 or what <7
sins have thy <222 committed, that we <779 be condemned of God or
<784 of this man?

12:14 And now, O <36 <1075 we are <8668 and thou, O <8 hast
not sinned; <608 this man has lied <183 you, and he has
<211 in vain.

12:15 And <31 we are strong, we <94 not come into <567 or be
<2507 <16867 by our <1112 yea, and thou hast prospered in the <2249
and thou <162 also prosper.

12:16 <265 here is the man, we <967 him into thy <2530 thou
<11406 do with him as <37083 thee <24452

12:17 And it came to pass that king Noah <1627 that <338 <122 be
cast into prison; and he <737 that the <1549 <12 <2902
<2903 <2903 that he <875 hold a council with them what he
<16 do with him.

12:18 And it came to pass that they said unto the <349 <37066 him
<13479 that we may question him; and the king <51 that he <34
be <363 <361 <346

12:19 And they <814 to <22 him, that they <61 <30251 him, that
<3392 they <7 have <4869 to <13208 him; but he <2740 them
boldly, and <18309 all <519 questions, yea, to <4 astonishment;
for he did withstand them in all <10 <14 and did <21085 them
in all <9 <13670

12:20 And it came to pass that one of them said unto him: What meaneth
the <959 <374 are <13677 and <4 have been <2651 by our <2883
<813

12:21 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
<5696 good tidings; that publisheth <17792 that <7 good
<11655 of <16590 that <10 <20368 that <358 unto <37947 Thy
God reigneth;

12:22 Thy watchmen <274 lift up the voice; with the <7028 <199
<10 they sing; for they <5 see eye to eye when the Lord <8
<1105 <2524 <35478

12:23 Break <423 into joy; sing <29 ye waste places of <12249
for the Lord hath comforted his <543 he hath <31293 <12

12:24 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
<33676 and all the ends of the <27146 <59 see the <7916 of our
God?

12:25 And now <304 said unto <7165 Are you <2078 and pretend to
<7762 this <59 and to <5608 the <9683 of <16758 and yet
<4718 to know of me what <1193 <676 <34843

12:26 I say unto you, wo be unto you for perverting the ways of the
<36914 For if ye <40 <27 <27 ye have not <210 <827
<459 ye have perverted the ways of the <930

12:27 Ye have not applied your <1098 to <15404 <21 ye
have not been wise. <4653 what <84 ye this <34864

12:28 And they <1319 We <12 the law of <11349

12:29 And <187 he said unto <118 If ye <17 the law of <11319 why do
ye not keep it? Why do ye set your <58 upon riches? Why do ye <2590
<2590 and <1991 your <3227 with harlots, yea, and <966 this
<590 to <16 sin, that the Lord has <11 to send me to <815
<816 this <165 yea, even a <616 evil <8 this <88

12:30 Know ye not that I <2228 the truth? Yea, ye know that I <8 the
<20756 and you <5244 to <12845 <450 God.

12:31 And it <235 come to pass that ye <6 be <962 for your
<1172 for ye have said that ye <116 the law of <133 And what
know ye <639 the law of Moses? Doth <267 come by the law of
<9 What say ye?

12:32 And they <481 and said that <21 did come by the law of
<41

12:33 But now <292 said unto <174 I know if ye keep the
<2795 of God ye <80 be <11467 yea, if ye keep the <12
<468 the Lord <1567 unto <194 in the mount of Sinai, <471

12:34 I am the Lord thy God, who hath <579 thee out of the land of
<6860 out of the <22484 of <4416

12:35 Thou <707 have no <1013 God <153 me.

12:36 Thou <12 not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness
of any <9266 in <8295 above, or <334 <76 are in the <412 beneath.

12:37 Now <112 said unto <1088 Have ye done all this? I say unto
you, Nay, ye have not. And have ye <363 this <266 that they <671
do all <377 things? I say unto you, Nay, ye have not.

<1523 <1523 13

13:1 And now when the king had <1692 <27 <6477 he said unto his
priests: Away with this fellow, and slay him; for what have we to do
with him, for he is mad.

13:2 And they <7687 <559 and attempted to lay <679 <1975 on him; but
he <711 <102 and said unto <218

13:3 <37677 me not, for God <216 <1289 you if ye lay your <28 upon
me, for I have not <218 the message <148 the Lord sent me to
deliver; <1853 have I told you that <14 ye <21193 that I <130
tell; <477 God will not <1908 that I <47 be <5064 at this
<15715

13:4 But I must <31040 the <271 <801 God has <834 me;
and <1048 I have told you the <10233 ye are <1228 with me. And <1119
<15 I have <1084 the word of God ye have <1037 me that I am mad.

13:5 Now it came to pass <1697 <231 had <25 <177 <795 that the
<216 of king Noah durst not lay <149 <121 on him, for the <9314 of
the Lord was upon him; and his face shone with <11041 luster, even
as Moses’ did <2441 in the <354 of <354 <6 <5470 with the
<614

13:6 And he <6409 with <5609 and authority from God; and he continued
his <244 <379

13:7 Ye see that ye have not <22 to slay me, <1845 I <16663 my
message. Yea, and I <27481 that it cuts you to your <597 <130 I
tell you the <145 <496 your <1199

13:8 Yea, and my <117 fill you with wonder and amazement, and with
<2263

13:9 But I <49 my message; and then it matters not <26384 I go, if
it so be that I am <17399

13:10 But this much I tell you, what you do with me, <174 <6379 <240
be as a type and a shadow of <428 <266 are to <12666

13:11 And now I read unto you the <9339 of the <253 of God,
for I <114 that they are not <6551 in your <2489 I <10
that ye have studied and <437 <28905 the most part of your <7110

13:12 And now, ye <5277 that I said unto you: Thou <74 not make
unto thee any <512 <512 or any <512 of <77 <77 are in
<513 <513 or <7 are in the <512 beneath, or <7 are in the
<32421 <1438 the <8506

13:13 And <6115 Thou <555 not bow down thyself unto <425 nor <6709
<875 for I the Lord thy God am a <2370 God, <2370 the <1670
of the <4475 upon the <8784 unto the <12403 and fourth <34753
of them that hate me;

13:14 And showing <8891 unto <2599 of them that love me and keep my
<8836

13:15 Thou <67 not take the name of the Lord thy God in <7578 for the
Lord will not hold him <10026 that taketh his name in <1402

13:16 Remember the <19661 day, to keep it holy.

13:17 Six days <45 thou labor, and do all thy <38224

13:18 But the seventh day, the <29 of the Lord thy God, thou <24
not do any <4529 <1471 nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant,
nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy <9147 that is <3193
thy gates;

13:19 For in six days the Lord made <204 and <8686 and the sea, and
all that in them is; <17654 the Lord <13061 the <67 day, and
hallowed it.

13:20 Honor thy <5646 and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon
the land <238 the Lord thy God <34315 <11953

13:21 Thou <98 not kill.

13:22 Thou <8 not <1009 adultery. Thou <5 not steal.

13:23 Thou <8 not bear <16773 <17526 <1004 thy neighbor.

13:24 Thou <13 not <10256 thy neighbor’s house, thou <7 not <7
thy <8 <15252 nor his <134 nor his <133 nor his
ox, nor his ass, nor <28829 that is thy neighbor’s.

13:25 And it came to pass that <431 <605 had made an end of <608
<15762 that he said unto <740 Have ye <394 this <615 that they
<702 <8885 to do all <21 <371 for to keep <5 commandments?

13:26 I say unto you, Nay; for if ye had, the Lord <5071 not have
<1599 me to come <801 and to <1126 evil <556 this <1942

13:27 And now ye have said that <1038 <12664 by the law of <1036 I
say unto you that it is <10254 that ye <71 keep the law of <1016
as yet; but I say unto you, that the time <466 come when it <4 no
more be <29 to keep the law of <44

13:28 And <12284 I say unto you, that <62 doth not come by the
law alone; and were it not for the atonement, <243 God <7028 <42
make for the sins and <452 of his <1228 that they must
unavoidably <19120 <7993 the law of <52

13:29 And now I say unto you that it was <72 that <3006 <101 be
a law <6351 to the <3352 of <18100 yea, even a very <31017 law; for
they were a <12708 <51 quick to do <39418 and slow to
<589 the Lord <819 God;

13:30 <5483 <43 was a law <41 <547 yea, a law of performances
and of ordinances, a law <100 they were to <234 strictly from day
to day, to keep them in <5273 of God and <43 duty <4274 him.

13:31 But <1896 I say unto you, that all <256 <261 were types of
<5 to <712

13:32 And now, did they <1489 the law? I say unto you, Nay, they
did not all <13 the law; and this <824 of the <20332 of
<57 <717 for they <4494 not that <100 <3200 not any man be
<11650 <2044 it were <6405 the <17551 of God.

13:33 For <76 did not <262 <301 unto them <302 the
<7677 of the <19856 and that God <180 redeem his <1431 Yea, and
even all the <12837 who have <2010 ever <11753 the <11763
began—have they not <999 more or less <36 <113 <1207

13:34 Have they not said that God <258 <40 come down <2428 the
<218 of men, and take upon him the form of man, and go <376 in
<6489 <959 upon the face of the <36298

13:35 Yea, and have they not said also that he <43 <1769 to pass the
<28653 of the <13353 and that he, <4069 <14 be oppressed and
afflicted?

<1273 <1273 14

14:1 Yea, even doth not Isaiah say: Who hath <10440 our report, and
to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?

14:2 For he <359 grow up <1392 him as a <28003 plant, and as a root
out of dry <26125 he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we <27
see him <210 is no beauty that we <81 <1769 him.

14:3 He is <28647 and <28470 of men; a man of sorrows, and
acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was
despised, and we <38561 him not.

14:4 Surely he has borne our griefs, and <2461 our sorrows; yet we
did <33380 him stricken, <1626 of God, and <7658

14:5 But he was <31538 for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
iniquities; the chastisement of our <5307 was upon him; and with his
stripes we are healed.

14:6 All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have <38648 <5081 one to
his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the <520 of us all.

14:7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he <12280 not his
<35588 he is <1606 as a lamb to the <4579 and as a sheep <200
her shearers is dumb so he <26 not his mouth.

14:8 He was <2338 from <9189 and from <19701 and who <202 <13295
his generation? For he was cut off out of the land of the living; for
the <21853 of my <749 was he stricken.

14:9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his
<7988 <468 he had done no <10667 <1488 was any deceit in his
<75

14:10 Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to <248
when thou <863 make his soul an <18702 for sin he <91 see his
<18857 he <6 prolong his <7478 and the pleasure of the Lord <10
<5527 in his <29182

14:11 He <11 see the travail of his <9940 and <8 be satisfied; by
his <6744 <7 my <10544 <25015 <38269 many; for he <8
bear <559 <1381

14:12 <659 will I divide him a portion with the <28843 and he
<22 <11 the spoil with the strong; <123 he hath <11528 out his
soul unto <133 and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he
bore the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

<468 <468 15

15:1 And now <957 said unto <947 I <913 that ye <413 <648
that God <557 <64 come down <557 the <556 of men, and <9
<607 his <920

15:2 And <76 he <14372 in <8220 he <16 be <7254 the Son of
God, and <4938 subjected the <14 to the will of the <14600 <4831
the <8309 and the Son—

15:3 The <13 <38 he was conceived by the <597 of God; and the
Son, <13 of the <22270 thus becoming the <30 and <29

15:4 And they are one God, yea, the very <41586 <16 of <1200 and
of <1390

15:5 And thus the <70 <33 <16020 to the <10928 or the Son to
the <63 <76 one God, suffereth temptation, and yieldeth not to
the <7 but <10 <135 to be mocked, and scourged, and
cast out, and disowned by his <135

15:6 And <1126 all <1558 <3 <14027 many <695 <41218 <159 the
<160 of men, he <144 be led, yea, even as <655 <23587 as a <433
<434 the shearer is dumb, so he <433 not his <358

15:7 Yea, even so he <31 be led, crucified, and <6787 the <100
<101 <101 even unto <21616 the will of the Son <99 swallowed
up in the will of the <21355

15:8 And thus God breaketh the <9647 of <27 <207 gained the
<4103 over <295 giving the Son <188 to make <284 for the
<93 of <39397

15:9 Having ascended into <10413 <28 the bowels of mercy; <55
<7780 with compassion <976 the <23 of men; <12333 betwixt
them and justice; <21 <27488 the <55 of <55 <531 upon <164
<383 <1649 and <3 <645 <15 <2560 <1037 and
satisfied the <14638 of justice.

15:10 And now I say unto you, who <126 <553 his <552 <2880
I say unto you, that when his soul has been made an <484 for sin he
<23 see his <36469 And now what say ye? And who <11 be his seed?

15:11 <28163 I say unto you, that <7612 has <2127 the <1833 of the
<14907 yea, all the holy <974 who have <974 <962 the
<998 of the Lord—I say unto you, that all <7099 who have <23203
unto <106 <1915 and <888 that the Lord <425 <406 his <1173
and have <28468 <3740 to that day for a <11665 of <23 <12545 I
say unto you, that <1010 are his <575 or they are heirs of the <5192
of God.

15:12 For <19 are they <4240 sins he has borne; <8 are they for
whom he has <6086 to <60 them from <48 transgressions. And now,
are they not his <126

15:13 Yea, and are not the <117 <803 one that has <316 his
<12539 to <4273 that has not <8881 into <17350 I mean all
the holy <135 ever <1106 the <1106 began? I say unto you that they
are his <185

15:14 And <76 are they who have published <15464 who have <816
good <2882 of <13506 who have <12 <2883 and said unto Zion:
Thy God reigneth!

15:15 And O how <2925 upon the <2925 were <102 feet!

15:16 And <2193 how <14 upon the <14 are the feet of <196
that are <15769 publishing peace!

15:17 And <22 how <22 upon the <22 are the feet of <22
who <264 <33093 publish <78 yea, from this time <37303 and
forever!

15:18 And <1255 I say unto you, this is not all. For O how <40
upon the <41 are the feet of him that <2994 good tidings, that
is the <41643 of <46 yea, even the <3840 who has <374 his
<4036 yea, him who has <10338 <1523 unto his <9

15:19 For were it not for the <1325 <1422 he hath made for his
<292 <8 was <7682 from the <13063 of the <13137 I say unto
you, were it not for <574 all <24044 must have <28662

15:20 But <100 the <450 of <32926 <122 be broken, and the Son
<14660 and hath <505 over the <14408 <2408 he <98 to pass
the <1275 of the <6661

15:21 And <1201 <1672 a <24844 even a <5981 resurrection; yea,
even a <21 of <169 that have <24224 and who are, and who <53
be, even <6719 the <17 of Christ—for so <10 he be <10995

15:22 And now, the <15 of all the <325 and all <37 that
have <419 in <251 <424 or all <10 that have kept the
<2215 of God, <37 come <1386 in the <69 <69
<94 they are the <7 resurrection.

15:23 They are <42224 to <10569 with God who has <193 <2147 thus
they have <5852 life <1505 <11043 who has <594 the <144 of
<10137

15:24 And <353 are <61 who have part in the <46 <53 and
<12 are they that have died <733 <9182 came, in <85 <18367
not <617 <234 <22150 unto <3373 And thus the Lord <169
<4892 the <36834 of <28731 and they have a part in the <41
<168 or have <71 <3732 <678 <80 by the <2480

15:25 And <11000 <682 also have <16 <24927

15:26 But <232 and fear, and <2976 <64 God, for ye <2983 to
tremble; for the Lord redeemeth none such that <33701 <2017 him and
die in <82 <12993 yea, even all <107 that have perished in <10 sins
ever <490 the <490 began, that have wilfully rebelled <28 God,
that have <8078 the <186 of God, and <617 not keep <162 <129
are they that have no part in the <102 <189

15:27 <1130 <72 ye not to tremble? For <137 <284 to none
such; for the Lord hath <117 none <7 yea, <1248 can the Lord
<602 <8 for he <12113 deny himself; for he <5 deny <13951
when it has its claim.

15:28 And now I say unto you that the time <264 come that the
<55 of the Lord <9 be <197 to <623 <14227 <14227
<14227 and <981

15:29 Yea, <458 thy <3445 <19 lift up <131 <3445 with the <3445
<3417 <10 they <3445 for they <5 see eye to eye, when the Lord
<9 <1676 <3258 <41344

15:30 <3445 <323 into joy, sing <16051 ye <3445 <3445 of
<3434 for the Lord hath <3445 his <477 he hath <121
<11063

15:31 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
nations; and all the ends of the <2522 <59 see the <109 of our
God.

<1255 <1255 16

16:1 And now, it came to pass that <1089 <1261 had <1824 <213 <873
he <27572 <84 his hand and <3365 The time <41 come when all
<5 see the <46 of the <6148 when <152 <152 <152
<152 and <1485 <15 see eye to eye and <6 <24233 <312 God
that his <11126 are just.

16:2 And then <16 the <18137 be cast out, and they <8 have <3356
to howl, and weep, and wail, and gnash <183 teeth; and this <1258
they <298 not <9677 unto the <191 of the <66 <2829 the Lord
<355 them not.

16:3 For they are <14060 and devilish, and the <39107 has <605 over
<328 yea, even that old serpent that did beguile our <327 parents,
<665 was the <66 of <58 <30403 <7 was the <7 of all <658
<1183 carnal, sensual, <39 <14987 evil from <842 subjecting
<3901 to the <20297

16:4 Thus all <22 were lost; and <443 they <87 have been
endlessly lost were it not that God <238 his <150 from <51 lost
and <924 state.

16:5 But <2189 that he that persists in his own <98 <14805 and
goes on in the ways of sin and <7055 <443 God, <10244 in his
<34 <14376 and the <116 hath all <117 over him. <3599 he is as
<14970 <711 was no <787 <11424 <540 an <13357 to God; and also is
the <27 an <10 to God.

16:6 And now if <599 had not come into the <800 <3049 of <2200
to come as <42 they had <15012 <8628 <46 <2168 have been no
<20394

16:7 And if <32 had not risen from the <2057 or have <670 the
<671 of <815 that the <1755 <1570 have no victory, and that <10
<8 have no sting, <43 <43 have been no <533

16:8 But <11 is a <643 <251 the <30 hath no <29
and the sting of <32 is <1384 up in <9886

16:9 He is the <25857 and the life of the <15261 yea, a <9 that is
endless, that can <12013 be darkened; yea, and also a life <255 is
<14 that <57 can be no more <759

16:10 Even this <14028 <345 put on <22827 and this corruption
<8 put on incorruption, and <5 be <1120 to <5507 <385 the bar
of God, to be <3275 of him <7067 to <255 <8633 <14637 they be
good or <6 they be evil—

16:11 If they be <308 to the <890 of <14612 life and
happiness; and if they be <1896 to the <14 of <14
damnation, <237 <3403 up to the <13623 who hath <1702 <1431
<101 is damnation—

16:12 <1482 gone <63 to <63 own <301 wills and desires;
<836 <128 <1733 upon the Lord <3293 the arms of <3002 were <18542
<1493 <409 for the arms of <10 were <10 <9 <44 and
they <368 not; they <60 <21453 of <41 <2081 and yet they
<12 not <8272 from <29 and they were <3427 to <4722 and yet
they <15 not repent.

16:13 And now, <768 ye not to <849 and <20 of your <1398 and
<390 that only in and <958 <294 ye can be saved?

16:14 <368 if ye <3823 the law of <22330 also <6 that it is a
<3257 of <861 <344 <128 are to come—

16:15 Teach them that <389 <819 <42 <42 the <749 who is
the very <1798 <1663 <6655

<664 <664 17

17:1 And now it came to pass that when <664 had <11998 <664
sayings, that the king <114 that the <4426 <352 take him and
<542 that he <8 be put to <287

17:2 But <298 was one <1783 them <1485 name was Alma, he also <164 a
<11102 of <6925 And he was a <7376 man, and he <1136 the <718
<103 <61 had <16412 for he knew <1587 the <1679 <10
<11 has testified <521 <185 <397 he <4430 to <32554 with
the king that he <186 not be <3610 with <5328 but <3650 that he
<4437 <211 in <7851

17:3 But the king was more wroth, and <2943 that Alma <96 be cast
out from <89 <253 and sent his <26461 <794 him that they <34
slay him.

17:4 But he fled from <381 them and hid <1762 that they <9661 him
not. And he <116 concealed for many days did <20393 all the <109 <98
<98 had <26670

17:5 And it came to pass that the king <71 that his <6060 <72
surround <22 and take him; and they <4934 him and cast him into
<11553

17:6 And <82 <8049 <2251 <367 counseled with his <4334 he <35
that he <35 <972 be <466 <83 him.

17:7 And he said unto him: <146 we have <90 an accusation <170
<9467 and thou art worthy of <228

17:8 For thou hast said that God <115 <41 come down <145 the
<1219 of men; and now, for this <260 thou <2336 be put to <593
<15394 thou wilt recall all the <125 <125 thou hast <958 evil
<232 me and my <1085

17:9 Now <117 said unto him: I say unto you, I will not <31 the
<31 <31 I have <31 unto you <31 this <1055 for they are
<16353 and that ye may know of <463 <11343 I have <7179 <18188 that
I have <794 into your <5721

17:10 Yea, and I will <271 even <1476 <1985 and I will not <54 my
<1454 and they <621 <618 as a <9817 <140 you. And if ye slay
me ye will shed innocent <6125 and this <20 also <21 as a
<22 <22 you at the last day.

17:11 And now king Noah was <1400 to release him, for he feared his
<41949 for he <6 that the <1053 of God <352 come upon him.

17:12 But the <438 <6217 up <109 voices <48 him, and <379 to
<4795 him, <3878 He has reviled the <21615 <1327 the king was
<40207 up in <5588 <23 him, and he <663 him up that he <354
be <8273

17:13 And it came to pass that they took him and <307 him, and
scourged his skin with faggots, yea, even unto <264

17:14 And now when the <15247 <69 to scorch him, he <13343 unto <410
<73

17:15 <2122 even as ye have done unto me, so <150 it come to pass
that thy seed <9 <282 that many <4 <198 the <32515 that I do
<14210 even the <8 of <292 by <28870 and this <1164 they <13387
in the <1228 of the Lord <138 God.

17:16 And it will come to pass that ye <42 be <6185 with all
<6840 of diseases <33 of your <2610

17:17 Yea, and ye <20 be <2894 on <1265 <11351 and <7 be <5243
and <21645 to and fro, even as a wild <9444 is <13 by wild and
ferocious <23338

17:18 And in that day ye <31 be hunted, and ye <5 be <2285 by the
hand of your <8572 and then ye <13 <111 as I <3 the <113
of <114 by <5368

17:19 Thus God executeth vengeance upon <747 that <5409 his <403
O God, <15292 my <34504

17:20 And now, when <411 had said <720 <347 he fell, <513
<381 <40 by <154 yea, <7 been put to <8 <125 he <301
not deny the <1628 of God, <15 <38231 the <4129 of his <432
by his <242

<778 <778 18

18:1 And now, it came to pass that <738 who had fled from the <655
of king <7437 <5919 of his sins and <4682 and went <374
privately <531 the <469 and <276 to <858 the <52 of Abinadi—

18:2 Yea, <485 that <493 was to <1199 and also <8 the
<1013 of the <1188 and the <864 of the <34 <19 was
to be <614 to pass <874 the <12887 and sufferings, and <112 of
<1882 and his <30 and ascension into heaven.

18:3 And as many as <128 hear his word he did teach. And he <3744
them privately, that it <397 not come to the <2895 of the <424
And many did <314 his <5198

18:4 And it came to pass that as many as did <17 him did go <1574
to a <8222 <87 was <1076 <20873 <178 <14957 its name from the
<5455 <777 in the borders of the land <15 been infested, by <23617
or at seasons, by wild <300

18:5 Now, <928 was in Mormon a fountain of pure <37723 and Alma
resorted thither, <14 <39 near the <4182 a thicket of <6878 <28361
<9481 he did hide <724 in the daytime from the searches of the <105

18:6 And it came to pass that as many as <955 him went thither to
hear his <120

18:7 And it came to pass <818 many days <59 were a goodly <7775
<11790 <1803 at the <120 of <118 to hear the <241 of Alma.
Yea, all were <17 <17 that <47 on his <23372 to hear him.
And he did <264 <536 and did <24233 unto them <40824 and
<27085 and <13578 on the <2039

18:8 And it came to pass that he said unto <3020 <558 here are the
<8131 of <144 (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are
<9283 to come into the fold of God, and to be <204 his <296 and
are <13792 to bear one another’s burdens, that they may be <38634

18:9 Yea, and are <18 to <25637 with <455 that <11474 yea, and
comfort <7 that <764 in need of comfort, and to <7 as <11713
of God at all <235 and in all <7486 and in all <1922 that ye may be
in, even <829 <829 that ye may be <1685 of God, and be <3163
with <47 of the <1751 <1536 that ye may have <2165 life—

18:10 Now I say unto you, if this be the <3564 of your <13478 what
have you <765 <270 <38196 in the name of the <1278 as a <4189
<1028 him that ye have <11761 into a <13205 with him, that ye will
<4457 him and keep his <15579 that he may pour out his <4749
more <34783 upon you?

18:11 And now when the <1777 had <2834 <577 <577 they clapped <713
<4777 for joy, and exclaimed: This is the <79 of our <7733

18:12 And now it came to pass that Alma took Helam, he <89 one of the
<28701 and went and <4969 <425 in the <379 and cried, <813 O
<101 pour out thy <73 upon thy <31357 that he may do this work
with holiness of <7970

18:13 And when he had said <80 <80 the <27 of the Lord was upon

not they the ones who have stolen the <149 of the Lamanites?

20:19 And now, <268 and tell the king of <90 <90 that he may
tell his <46 that they may be pacified <1752 us; for <14650 they
are <4722 preparing to come <171 us; and <11 also <680 are but

into the <2135 of the land <1285 <10820

21:3 Now they <1115 not slay <99 <348 of the oath <319 <96 king
had made unto Limhi; but they <360 <8364 them on <13 cheeks, and
<10597 <2792 over <861 and <49 to put heavy <9707 upon <15
backs, and <878 them as they <27 a dumb ass—

21:4 Yea, all this was done that the word of the Lord <1339 be
fulfilled.

21:5 And now the <14400 of the <15723 were <6806 and <478 was

complaints; <709 he <1662 unto them that they <450 do
<2792 to <15 desires.

21:7 And they <1104 <83 <1244 <3414 and put on <15
armor, and went <353 <48 the <89 to <149 them out of <14
<281

21:8 And it came to pass that the <20 did beat <208 and <10753

daughter <10 for <61 <513 and the brothers for <6
<16550

21:10 Now <41 were a <41 many widows in the <1555 and they did cry
<10469 from day to day, for a <18 fear of the <86 had come
upon <78

21:11 And it came to pass that <49 <1551 <12930 did stir up the
<2633 of the <83 of <391 to <349 <140 the <477 and
they went <364 to battle, but they were <4439 back <165 suffering
much loss.

21:12 Yea, they went <20 even the <8264 <18628 and <4377 in the
like manner; and <2001 that were not <1838 <435 <19 to the city
of <5078

21:13 And they did <19112 <213 even to the <46990 <5650

and to be <70 to and fro, and burdened, <252 to the <3098 of

21:14 And they did <44 <30 even in the <19155 of humility;
and they did cry <160 to God; yea, even all the day long did they
cry unto <36 God that he <416 <372 them out of <9 afflictions.

21:15 And now the Lord was slow to hear <14 cry <357 of <4
<7478 <37608 the Lord did hear <8 cries, and <364 to
soften the <2158 of the <209 that they <11 to ease <17

that had been <4882

21:18 Now the <311 of <49 kept <461 in a body as much as it was
<29150 and secured <30 <101 and <3 flocks;

21:19 And the king <801 did not <12200 his person <775 the <11638
of the <13765 <5135 he took his <1941 with him, <1806 that he <80
by some <13639 fall into the <2520 of the <856

21:20 And he <1237 that his <73 <116 <3194 the land <718 <23634
that by some <28 they <34 take <354 <974 that fled into the
<974 who had <1174 the <970 of the <1823 and that had
<38 such a <171 <25949 to come upon <449

21:21 For they were <622 to take them that they <44 punish <735
for they had come into the land of <1738 by <41145 and <1813 off
<129 <132 and many of <5 <2586 <16355 <206 they laid wait
for <47

21:22 And it came to pass that <228 was no more disturbance <26508
the <311 and the <112 of <579 even <4149 the time that <14487
and his <12626 came into the <637

21:23 And the king <1558 been <176 the gates of the city with his
<16959 <1801 <29 and his <24324 and supposing them to be
<143 of Noah <78 he <129 that they <166 be <16978 and
<16978 and cast into <5423 And had they been the <23 of Noah he
<431 have <25 that they <25 be put to <4889

21:24 But when he <1692 that they were not, but that they were his
<11385 and had come from the land of <14271 he was <4090 with
<1798 <192 joy.

21:25 Now king <309 had sent, previous to the <3358 of <15331 a <2114
<335 of men to <1451 for the land of <17214 but they <878 not
find it, and they were lost in the <2010

21:26 <14243 they did find a land <981 had been peopled; yea, a
land <8 was <15216 with dry bones; yea, a land <9 had been
<15211 and <6 had been <2753 and <3566 <177 supposed it to
be the land of <99 <657 to the land of <1091 <16 <12785
in the <1051 of the land not many days <1183 the <99 of Ammon.

21:27 And they <1718 a <10611 with <850 even a <5 of the <250
<2827 <15297 they had found; and it was <12767 on <12766 of ore.

21:28 And now <145 was <718 <160 with joy in learning from the
<4129 of <247 that king <1185 had a gift from God, <17080 he <145
<15202 such engravings; yea, and <18 also did rejoice.

21:29 Yet <9 and his <302 were <42 with <13677 <522 so
many of <355 <11 had been <2563

21:30 And also that king Noah and his <270 had <265 the <94 to
<8861 so many sins and <2899 <844 God; and they also did <4768
for the <2767 of <11614 and also for the departure of Alma and the
<32 that went with him, who had formed a <3951 of God <4502 the
<9924 and <3977 of God, and <4179 on the <1554 <206 had been <4254
by Abinadi.

21:31 Yea, they did <56 for <93 departure, for they knew not
<9329 they had <3189 Now they <355 have gladly joined with <191 for
they <825 had <4594 into a <4594 with God to <4595 him and
keep his <9151

21:32 And now <6922 the <232 of <331 king <196 had also <29
into a <30 with God, and also many of his <1504 to <36 him and
keep his <36

21:33 And it came to pass that king <35 and many of his <131 were
<571 to be baptized; but <526 was none in the land that had
<1314 from God. And <217 declined <28428 this thing, considering
<691 an <20083 servant.

21:34 <1897 they did not at that time form <112 into a
<45913 <2258 upon the <4692 of the <3722 Now they were <56 to
<17826 even as Alma and his <472 who had fled into the <420

21:35 They were <22 to be <4531 as a <4904 and a <4754
that they were <5013 to <120 God with all <191 <8725 <940
they did <8218 the <11968 and an <26542 of <13 <42759 <1630 be
<8832 hereafter.

21:36 And now all the study of <110 and his <159 and king <142 and
his <7 was to <948 <101 out of the <781 of the <662
and from <956

<380 <1565 22

22:1 And now it came to pass that <43 and king <40 <956 to consult
with the <184 how they <614 <44 <44 out of <11772 and
even they did <2102 that all the <18 <16 <2718 <16
<25166 and this they did that they <776 have the <6863 of the
<19 <1805 the matter.

22:2 And it came to pass that they <448 find no way to <53
<38 out of <1171 <1947 it were to take <138 <3616 and
<979 and <6 <1030 and <3 <1031 and <3 <29811 and
<2864 into the <2643 for the <122 <2112 so <38211 it was
<37689 for the <63 of <109 to <13140 with <362 thinking to
<53 <52 out of <1917 by the sword.

22:3 Now it came to pass that <2155 went <1453 and <4312 <595 the
<1815 and said unto him: Now O <7 thou hast <23085 <7907 unto
my <442 many <5227 when we have been contending with our <277 the

22:4 And now O <29 if thou hast not <776 me to be an <23648
<5080 or if thou hast <43 listened to my <42 in any degree,
and they have been of <23826 to <5063 even so I <5150 that thou
wouldst <39825 to my <24 at this <1371 and I will be thy <8483 and
<119 this <131 out of <262

22:5 And the king <1595 unto him that he <217 <17656 And <122 said
unto him:

the city. The <1049 or the <1109 of the <6 by <14380 are
drunken; <929 let us send a <17340 <1567 all this <66
that they <281 <1174 <223 <12398 and <228 that they may <1628

22:7 And I will go <1419 to thy <11885 and pay the last <3100 of
wine to the <58 and they will be <58 and we will pass
<88 the <2920 pass on the left of <56 camp when they are <48681

22:8 Thus we will <291 with our <309 and our <309 our <308
and our herds into the <303 and we will <18132 around the land
of <14985

22:9 And it came to pass that the king <266 unto the <199 of
<3460

22:10 And king <324 <776 that his <133 <412 <131 <74 <130

sent more <48765 as a <25973 unto <1202 and they did <19315 freely of
the wine <758 king <44 did send unto <1187

22:11 And it came to pass that the <56 of king <19 did <116 by

22:13 And <2122 <51 many days in the <86 they <1058 in the
land of <65 and <851 Mosiah’s <638 and <2970 his subjects.

22:14 And it came to pass that <634 <2834 them with joy; and he
also <8 <50 <28613 and also the <13827 <73 had been <452
by the <147 of <2269

22:15 And now it came to pass when the <558 had <21 that the
<21 of <167 had <4560 out of the land by <1396 that they sent
an army into the <90 to <4205 <218

22:16 And <105 they had <116 them two <6730 they <135 no <17657
<43855 <75 tracks; <409 they were lost in the <813

<97 <731 23

23:1 Now <5322 <1190 been <7094 of the Lord that the <3216 of king
Noah <990 come upon <170 and <18 made it <7876 to his <145
<45 they <2079 <443 <51 <364 and took of <5 <30402
and <97 into the <85 <626 the <37 of king Noah.

23:2 And the Lord did strengthen <42 that the <123 of king Noah
<92 not <4309 them to <3256 <314

23:3 And they fled <29340 <15562 <14114 into the <98

23:4 And they came to a <1775 yea, even a very <4896 and pleasant
<9 a land of pure <5540

23:5 And they <15590 <82 <753 and <842 to till the <3105 and
<7 to <15455 <13419 yea, they were industrious, and did <5157
exceedingly.

23:6 And the <85 were <967 that Alma <436 be <36 <698 for
he was <27925 by his <2571

23:7 But he said unto <2608 <3037 it is not <9838 that we <28
have a <4630 for thus <11388 the <22050 Ye <974 not <9433 one <8869
<13357 <5399 or one man <11 not <25017 <1076 <9 <45782
<182 I say unto you it is not <40 that ye <40 have a
<3853

23:8 <1469 if it were <22494 that ye <169 <19285 have just
men to be your <29876 it <233 be well for you to have a <31

23:9 But <2957 the <7164 of king Noah and his <5584 and I
<6894 was caught in a snare, and did many <2765 <372 were <13831
in the <13832 of the <2848 <10 <582 me sore repentance;

23:10 <73 <336 much <31775 the Lord did hear my <2041
and did <15153 my <12714 and has made me an instrument in his <1076
in <17744 so many of you to a <5075 of his truth.

23:11 <42 in this I do not <38894 for I am <1223 to <21219
of myself.

23:12 And now I say unto you, ye have been <9752 by king <3738 and
have been in <983 to him and his <7139 and have been <1557 into
<131 by <435 <188 ye were <3361 with the <7726 of <13747

23:13 And now as ye have been <6904 by the <1432 of God out of
<3074 bonds; yea, even out of the <106 of king Noah and his <413
and also from the bonds of <10077 even so I <956 that ye <233
<4596 fast in this liberty <10965 ye have been made <19902 and that
ye <2029 no man to be a king over you.

23:14 And also <15 no one to be your teacher nor your minister,
<1148 he be a man of God, <24410 in his ways and <14569 his
<1427

23:15 Thus did Alma <5511 his <83 that <2158 man <72 love his
<20477 as <9913 that <1424 <9 be no <5046 <959 <466

23:16 And now, Alma was <394 high priest, he <689 the <8764 of
<9 <5891

23:17 And it came to pass that none <666 <1453 to <5808 or to
<58 <82 it were by him from God. <1448 he <13990 all
<33 <1657 and all <4 teachers; and none were <12 <22
they were just men.

23:18 <25 they did <2129 over <21 <95 and did <33911 them
with <341 <5913 to <21367

23:19 And it came to pass that they <510 to <2325 <1930 in the
<12404 and they <6017 the land Helam.

23:20 And it came to pass that they did <15913 and <26
<27 in the land of Helam; and they <13582 a <2228 <386 they

23:21 Nevertheless the Lord <22720 fit to chasten his <3140 yea, he
trieth <89 patience and <3 <30470

23:22 Nevertheless—whosoever <21060 his <231 in him the same <519 be
<7243 up at the last day. Yea, and thus it was with this <574

23:23 For <3350 I will show unto you that they were <361 into
<1408 and none <522 <1245 them but the Lord <57 God, yea, even
the God of <39243 and Isaac and of <45104

23:24 And it came to pass that he did <31 <732 and he did show
<1382 his <9520 <381 unto <11 and <2092 were <42 rejoicings.

23:25 For <70 it came to pass that <7936 they were in the land of
<6403 yea, in the city of <6 <15 <15863 the land <1045 <2351
<3462 an army of the <913 was in the <2034 of the <2243

23:26 Now it came to pass that the <1946 of Alma fled from <64
<13731 and <845 <1479 <846 in the city of <208 and they
were much frightened <1975 of the appearance of the <1445

23:27 But Alma went <105 and <1487 <367 <104 and exhorted them that
they <379 not be frightened, but that they <7 <660 the Lord
<55 God and he <682 <140 <392

23:28 <326 they hushed <14 fears, and <304 to cry unto the Lord
that he <22 <2677 the <2677 of the <1332 that they <9 <5053

23:29 And it came to pass the the Lord did <31 the <31 of the
<95 And Alma and his <129 went <94 and <582
<125 up into <35 <12425 and the <161 took possession of
the land of <329

23:30 Now the <976 of the <68 <347 had <3424 <726 the

23:33 And it came to pass that <33 did <3468 with the <1384 and
he also sent <125 <119 <157 who were the <2618 of the

did not <22 <201 <277 of <24 wives.

23:35 And <19 and his <183 did join the <50 and they were
traveling in the <148 in <2455 of the land of <2645 when they
<2570 the land of <371 <142 was <14272 by Alma and his

23:36 And it came to pass that the <74 <15195 unto Alma and his
<74 that if they <276 show them the way <36 led to the land of
<52 that they <15 <6778 unto them <88 <21658 and <3 liberty.

23:37 But <236 Alma had <44837 them the way that led to the land of
<31 the <56 <31 not keep <27 promise; but they set <1726
<454 <1499 the land of <93 over Alma and his <89

23:38 And the <3214 of them went to the land of <26878 and a part
of them <2519 to the land of <32 and also <580 with them the
<4670 and the <4984 of the <53 who had been left in the <497

23:39 And the king of the <79 had <1835 unto <190 that he
<229 be a king and a <17011 over his <761 who were in the land of
<504 <2182 he <20 have no <591 to do <11262 <24720 to
the will of the king of the <416

<1417 <1417 24

24:1 And it came to pass that <58 did gain favor in the eyes of the
king of the <320 <3945 the king of the <81 <80
unto him and his <271 that they <63 be <20299 <28129 over
his <81 yea, even over the <431 who were in the land of <5852
and in the land of <14487 and in the land of <384

24:2 For the <49 had <1665 <484 of all <1071 lands;
<63 the king of the <14 had <53 <1262 over all <14
lands.

24:3 And now the name of the king of the <22 was <15365 <977
<466 <267 the name of his father; and <1142 he was <11 king
Laman. And he was king over a <4154 <816

24:4 And he <54 <107 of the <116 of <144 in <1045 land
<330 was <366 by his <877 and thus the <17309 of <303 <641

24:8 And now it came to pass that <123 <51 to <3942 <1175
over Alma and his <520 and <11 to <42190 him, and <2460 that
his <423 <110 <9 <38 <798

24:9 For <31 knew <1775 that he had been one of the <4517 <1397
and that it was he that <7704 the <153 of <4373 and was <3613

<10487 to king <291 yet he exercised <77 over <661 and put
tasks upon <6 and put task-masters over <905

24:10 And it came to pass that so <1044 were <84 <3999 that
they <101 to cry <3638 to God.

24:11 And <93 <3504 them that they <107 stop <23 <14312 and

24:12 And Alma and his <304 did not <3585 <38 <8428 to the Lord
<6 God, but did pour out <6 <939 to him; and he did know the
<21076 of <12 <7589

24:13 And it came to pass that the <2630 of the Lord came to them in
<22 <13886 <6309 Lift up your <16320 and be of good <7768
for I know of the <2907 <405 ye have made unto me; and I will

God, do <14138 my <73 in <107 <3821

24:15 And now it came to pass that the <72 <72 were laid upon
Alma and his <470 were made <7915 yea, the Lord did <2037
them that they <1342 bear up <39 <26 with ease, and they did
<24125 cheerfully and with <1410 to all the will of the <2966

24:16 And it came to pass that so <286 was <33 <3146 and <3
<26 that the <196 of the Lord came unto them <4033 <193 Be of
good <189 for on the <19930 I will <173 you out of <173

24:17 And he said unto Alma: Thou <8869 go <379 this <470 and I
will go with thee and <28 this <132 out of <29

24:18 Now it came to pass that Alma and his <17 in the night-time

the <16 were they gathering the <17 <7277

24:19 And in the morning the Lord <1953 a deep sleep to come upon the

24:20 And Alma and his <64 <2236 into the <2428 and when
they had <18751 all day they <2172 <30 <6913 in a valley, and
they <756 the valley <526 <1137 he led <15 way in the

<2722 and all <5 <626 that <34 <13280 <1669 <6 <483 in
the <26181 of <7 God.

24:23 And now the Lord said unto <236 Haste thee and get thou and this
<147 out of this <2321 for the <755 have <17292 and do <2474
<25311 <631 get thee out of this <17 and I will stop the
<21 in this <134 that they come no further in pursuit of this
<911

24:24 And it came to pass that they <200 out of the <186 and
took <83 <2402 into the <178

24:25 And <962 they had been in the <1311 <17688 days they
<2635 in the land of <3769 and king <1104 did also <5993 them
with joy.

<11 <1115 25

25:1 And now king <10 <288 that all the <117 <646 be <326
<308

25:2 Now <2017 were not so many of the <168 of <3749 or so many of
<1469 who were <47538 of <11 as <22 were of the <37 of
<2703 who was a <9508 of Mulek, and <22 who came with him
into the <107

25:3 And <29 were not so many of the <32 of <1028 and of the
<7 of <18705 as <18 were of the <1188 yea, they were not
half so <30890

25:4 And now all the <25 of <32 were <27557 <426 and also
all the <11 of <74 and they were <115 <1782 in two
bodies.

25:5 And it came to pass that <139 did <50835 and <142 to be <5
the <2773 of <16311 to his <1112 yea, he read the <10 of the
<46 of <16486 from the time they left the land of <91 <4111
they <1388 again.

25:6 And he also read the <3510 of Alma and his <976 and all
<248 <775 from the time they left the land of <34 <34
the time they <36 <36

25:7 And now, when <84 had made an end of reading the <2859 his
<71 who <6093 in the land were struck with <13109 and amazement.

25:8 For they knew not what to think; for when they <38419 <208 that
had been <456 out of <2421 they were <3896 with <2140
<676 joy.

25:9 And <666 when they <6042 of <90 <736 who had been <4680
by the <381 they were <28 with <41438 and even shed many tears
of sorrow.

25:10 And <33 when they <33 of the <19769 <22563 of God,
and his <1472 in delivering Alma and his <46 out of the <2441 of
the <46 and of <527 they did <973 <62 <490 and give
<515 to God.

25:11 And <47 when they <47 upon the <647 who were <22
<180 of <4 sinful and polluted <24500 they were <83 with
pain and <7276 for the <33967 of <17 <7527

25:12 And it came to pass that <144 who were the <386 of <1079
and his <41 who had <1460 to wife the <1829 of the <56
were displeased with the conduct of <40 <14205 and they <1689 no
<2997 be <678 by the <21360 of <14 <14 <546 they took
upon <1988 the name of <422 that they <1333 be <21 the
<57 of <360 and be <8767 <1279 <68 who were <13 <6485

25:13 And now all the <252 of <280 were <19 with the
<5272 and this <701 the <6492 had been <6619 upon none but
<34 who were <476 of <4891

25:14 And now it came to pass that when <302 had made an end of
<10426 and <305 to the <888 he <22618 that Alma <536 also
<687 to the <618

25:15 And Alma did <11 unto <756 when they were <452 <439
in <30765 bodies, and he went from one body to <2911 <33410 unto
the <94 <8344 and <980 on the <998

25:16 And he did exhort the <16 of <3191 and his <186 all <96
that had been <342 out of <265 that they <72 <2228 that
it was the Lord that did <800 <1323

25:17 And it came to pass that <676 Alma had <1523 the <45 many
<3341 and had made an end of <119 to <95 that king <58 was
<3044 that he <201 be <4091 and all his <27 were <11
that they <12 be <4025 <21145

25:18 <10248 Alma did go <2099 into the <8697 and did <8645 <2831
yea, he did <6 them <64 the <1518 he did his <371 in the
<8048 of <8058 yea, and as many as he did <22 did <23568 to the
<4281 of God; and this <234 of <286 belief on the <1477 of <9193

25:19 And it came to pass that king <226 <1844 unto Alma that he
<84 <6826 <50349 <25281 all the land of <790 and gave
him <442 to <8609 <2211 and <1749 over <1744 <2755

25:20 Now this was done <57 <704 were so many <125 that they
<940 not all be governed by one teacher; <1710 <9 they all hear
the word of God in one assembly;

25:21 <2420 they did <8402 <372 <264 in different
<264 <1837 <357 <53315 <57 <110 <3352 <105 <65 and
<4 <28593 and <10 <8692 <271 the word <3773 as it was
<247 to him by the <4518 of <123

25:22 And thus, <13082 <81 <39 many <113 they were all
one <4264 yea, even the <47 of God; for <17 was <6206 <36152
in all the <22 <1070 it were <318 and <318 in God.

25:23 And now <23 were seven <18 in the land of <20224 And
it came to pass that <1574 were <258 to take upon them the name
of <8831 or of God, they did join the <32 of God;

25:24 And they were <122 the <164 of God. And the Lord did pour out
his <4349 upon <317 and they were <26795 and <14955 in the <2163

<232 <993 26

26:1 Now it came to pass that <86 were many of the <21631 <30463
that <199 not <12427 the <272 of king <30021 <142 <8485
<550 at the time he <13953 unto his <870 and they did not <9619
the <17711 of <192 <18420

26:2 They did not <14 what had been said <1958 the
<9699 of the <6519 <250 did they <15 <11 the
<4539 of <10872

26:3 And now <283 of <39 <42752 they <71 not <71 the
word of God; and <12 <1696 were hardened.

26:4 And they <658 not be <434 <44 <5 they join the
<326 And they were a <28754 <154 as to <29 <19558 and remained
so ever after, even in <10 <10787 and <750 state; for they <31
not call upon the Lord <14 God.

26:5 And now in the <17293 of <167 they were not half so <2138 as
the <49 of God; but <93 of the <30351 <696 the <464
they <3825 more <1078

26:6 For it came to pass that they did deceive many with <53
<17037 <9222 who were in the <320 and did <1977 them to <4798
many <11622 <760 it <38 <3529 that <611 who <22071 sin,
that were in the <24 <610 be <32208 by the <124

26:7 And it came to pass that they were <2444 <1596 the <1995 and
<393 up unto the <413 by the <3194 and the <6 <17
them <19 <1496 who was the high priest.

26:8 Now king <125 had <4591 Alma the <1991 over the <54

26:9 And it came to pass that Alma did not know <239 <606 but
<306 were many <1799 <4893 <8 yea, the <150 <2941 and
<10744 of <125 <3457 in abundance.

<54389 Now <23 had not any such <6572 <7608 <70 in the church;
<128 Alma was troubled in his <27128 and he <1203 that they
<126 be <93 <21 the <3634

<54339 And he said unto the <6623 <3727 here are many whom we have
<22 <22 <4420 who are accused of <65 <5282 yea, and they
have been <971 in <23846 <10279 And they do not <10984 of <18
<5672 <65 we have <31 them <32 <32 that thou
<15364 <24297 them <565 to <18 <43987

<54366 But king <150 said unto <1549 <63 I <18 them not;
<33 I <813 them into thy <1102 to be judged.

<54352 And now the <15060 of Alma was <5123 troubled; and he went and
<20579 of the Lord what he <119 do <173 this matter, for he
<10547 that he <11 do wrong in the <3730 of God.

<54346 And it came to pass that <798 he had <1712 out his <27766 soul
to God, the <1900 of the Lord came to him, <1899

<54343 Blessed art <14080 <262 and <8835 are they who were <856 in
the <826 of Mormon. Thou art <14 <378 of thy <14502 <645
in the <541 <42051 of my <4577 <5088

<54274 And <20 are they <22 of <149 <22 <22 in the
<22 <22 <2029 thou hast <5113 unto <954

<54222 And <24 art thou <24 thou hast <29328 a <710 <426
this <573 and they <3413 be established, and they <5 be my
<1061

<54197 Yea, <30 is this <308 who are <4959 to bear my <23461 for
in my name <26 they be <23510 and they are <36236

<54182 And <56 thou hast <184 of me <179 the transgressor,
thou art <35338

<54173 Thou art my <38188 and I <2215 with thee that thou <2027
have <9732 <8514 and thou <7 <5016 me and go <998 in my <24708 and
<11 <4508 <865 my sheep.

<54137 And he that will hear my <195 <75 be my sheep; and him <6
ye <1733 into the <495 and him will I also <47701

<54148 For <3214 this is my <399 <809 is <205 <26 be
<4 unto <33552 And whomsoever ye <32 <10 <691 in my
<128 and him will I <4544 forgive.

<54117 For it is I that <14378 upon me the sins of the <11570 for it is
I that hath <21419 <478 and it is I that granteth unto him that
believeth unto the end a <3274 at my <23695 <13335

<54141 For <81 in my name are they <183 and if they know me they
<77 come <16989 and <4 have a <31 <27811 at my <32 <32

<54120 And it <15 come to pass that when the <9838 trump <9 <29337
then <4 they that <11516 knew me come <180 and <9 <2363 <461
me.

<54110 And then <11 they know that I am the Lord <319 God, that I am
<6 <9204 but they <764 not be redeemed.

<54106 And then I will <12033 unto them that I <52 knew <129 and
they <41 <4677 into <23475 fire <9969 for the <11839 and his
<36388

<54090 <1113 I say unto you, that he that will not hear my <24259
the same <33 ye not <207 into my <239 for him I will not
<10 at the last day.

<54087 <38 I say unto you, Go; and <245 transgresseth <676
me, him <35 ye <557 <574 to the sins <419 he has committed;
and if he <94 his sins <136 thee and me, and <25120 in the
<25615 of his <21424 him <32 ye forgive, and I will <25619 him
<1350

<54096 Yea, and as <9621 as my <420 <642 will I <18 them <153
trespasses <65 me.

<54059 And ye <37 also <15 one <2906 your trespasses; for verily
I say unto you, he that forgiveth not his <14492 <29 when he
says that he repents, the same hath <681 <4416 <8686 condemnation.

<54077 Now I say unto you, Go; and <121 will not <65 of his sins
the same <56 not be <1624 <521 my <520 and this <9 be
<34392 from this time <10016

<54029 And it came to pass when Alma had <7414 <3165 <570 he <33404 them
down that he <1392 have <1182 and that he <6 <169 the <121 of
that <570 <175 to the <10925 of God.

26:34 And it came to pass that Alma went and <11915 <970 that had been
<800 in <4279 <28 to the word of the <1612

26:35 And <103 <10921 of <163 sins and did <210 <60 them
he did <6019 <103 the <61 of the <489

26:36 And <45 that <336 not <22 <27 sins and <133 of <5
<50 the same were not <132 <29 the <29 of the <295
and <16 <1811 were <24030 out.

26:37 And it came to pass that Alma did regulate all the <18236 of the
<56 and they <2961 <827 to have <7132 and to <4157 <2016
in the <19 of the <45 <4329 circumspectly <296 God,
receiving <13752 and baptizing many.

26:38 And now all <174 <4227 did Alma and his <20750 laborers do who
were over the <32 <32 in all <35740 <30831 the word of
God in all <1698 <6758 all <1643 of <2148 <1335
<45061 by all <124 who did not <1635 to the <197 of God.

26:39 And they did <45637 <116 <990 and they were also
admonished, <1534 one by the word of God, <194 to his <11973 or to
the sins <402 he had <16452 <51 <3067 of God to pray <6319
ceasing, and to give <2056 in all <18162

<993 <1435 27

27:1 And now it came to pass that the persecutions <39 were inflicted
on the <80 by the unbelievers <1233 so <2170 that the <9 <168
to murmur, and complain to <86 <34620 <809 the <7775 and
they did <11 to <1606 And Alma laid the case <174 <18 <3206
<28559 And <62 consulted with his <8910

27:2 And it came to pass that king <16 sent a <5455
<1740 the land <3746 <3746 that <1182 <1028 not any unbeliever
<3282 any of <163 who <31530 to the <72 of God.

27:3 And <22 was a <14709 <5453 <33 all the <1592 that
<11 <33 be no <111 <298 <334 that <8 <8 be an
equality <9 all men;

27:4 That they <14 let no <17831 nor haughtiness disturb <95 <16318
that <195 man <13 <4918 his <4584 as <4584 <31666 with
<15 own <1146 for <4 <10215

27:5 Yea, and all <9 <1341 and <1825 <26 <4999 with <7
own <21 for <5 support, in all cases save it were in sickness, or
in much want; and <6036 <312 <286 they did <45667 in the <10181 of
God.

27:6 And <95 <194 to be much <362 <366 in the <4541 and the <406
<13 to be very <5817 and <6 to scatter abroad upon the face of
the <15191 yea, on the <18225 and on the <50703 on the east and on the
<50720 building <2125 cities and villages in all quarters of the <1721

27:7 And the Lord did <3183 them and <423 <167 and they <272 a
<28 and wealthy <1113

27:8 Now the sons of <235 were <487 <180 the unbelievers; and
also one of the sons of Alma was <14 <14 <36 he <352 <1797
<1229 <1257 his <3754 <9252 he <44 a very <12872 and an
<20442 man. And he was a man of many <1582 and did <2223 much
flattery to the <668 <1351 he led many of the <137 to do <40
the <453 of his <1409

27:9 And he <48 a <364 hinderment to the prosperity of the <296
of God; stealing away the <1738 of the <42 <28100 much dissension
<84 the <7 <14002 a chance for the <9855 of God to <3633 his
<2076 over <1270

<54197 And now it came to pass that <3371 he was <35629 <360 to <4238
the <53 of God, for he did go <12 secretly with the sons of <152
<35812 to <20 the <560 and to lead <52400 the <103 of the
<5141 <4039 to the <736 of God, or even the king—

27:11 And as I said unto you, as they were going about rebelling
against God, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto them; and he
descended as it were in a cloud; and he spake as it were with a voice
of thunder, which caused the earth to shake upon <7 they stood;

27:12 And so great was their astonishment, that they fell to the earth,
and understood not the words <25 he <44 unto them.

27:13 Nevertheless he cried again, saying: Alma, arise and stand forth,
for why persecutest thou the church of God? For the Lord hath said:
This is my church, and I will establish it; and nothing shall overthrow
it, save it is the transgression of my people.

27:14 And <50 the <125 <33 Behold, the Lord hath heard the
prayers of his people, and also the <7 of his servant, <70 who
is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that
thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore, for
this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of
God, that the <52 of his servants might be answered according to
<156 faith.

27:15 And now <213 can ye dispute the <31 of God? For <9 doth
not my <200 <192 the earth? And can ye not also behold me before you?
And I am sent from God.

27:16 Now I say unto thee: Go, and remember the captivity of thy
fathers in the land of Helam, and in the land of Nephi; and <19
how <233 things he has done for <278 for they were in bondage, and he
has delivered <230 And now I say unto thee, <157 go thy way, and seek
to destroy the <226 no more, that <113 <124 may be answered, and
this even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off.

27:17 And now it came to pass that these were the last <288 <288 the
<227 <290 unto <53 and he departed.

27:18 And now Alma and those that were with him fell again to the
<323 for <101 was <65 astonishment; for with <4 own eyes they
had beheld an <41 of the Lord; and his <174 was as <374 <54
shook the earth; and they knew that there was <309 save the <201 of
God that could <197 the <393 and cause it to tremble as though it
would part asunder.

27:19 And now the astonishment of Alma was so <71 that he became
dumb, that he <36 not open his mouth; yea, and he <13 weak, even
that he <14 not move his hands; therefore he was taken by <115 that
were with him, and carried helpless, even until he was laid <260 his
father.

27:20 And they rehearsed unto his father all that had happened unto
<232 and his <10 rejoiced, for he knew that it was the <111 of
God.

27:21 And he <508 that a multitude should be gathered together that
they <352 witness what the Lord had done for his son, and also for
<81 that were with him.

27:22 And he <36 that the priests <36 assemble themselves
together; and they began to fast, and to pray to the Lord <209 God
that he <164 open the mouth of <249 that he <58 speak, and also
that his limbs <8 receive <23 strength—that the eyes of the people
<10 be opened to see and know of the goodness and glory of God.

27:23 And it came to pass after they had fasted and <499 for the
space of two days and two nights, the <51 of Alma received <52
strength, and he stood up and <92 to speak unto them, bidding them to
be of good comfort:

27:24 For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed
of the <314 <477 I am born of the Spirit.

27:25 And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men
and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and <606 must be born
again; yea, born of God, changed from <86 carnal and fallen state, to
a state of righteousness, being <61 of God, becoming his sons and
daughters;

27:26 And thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they
can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.

27:27 I say unto you, <22 this be the case, they must be cast off;
and this I know, because I was like to be cast off.

27:28 Nevertheless, <189 wading through much tribulations, repenting
nigh unto death, the Lord in mercy hath seen fit to snatch me out of an
everlasting burning, and I am born of God.

27:29 My soul hath been <110 from the gall of bitterness and bonds
of iniquity. I was in the darkest abyss; but now I <186 the marvelous
light of God. My soul was racked with eternal torment; but I am
snatched, and my soul is pained no more.

27:30 I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that <531 had been spoken of
by our fathers; but now that they may foresee that he will come, and
that he remembereth every creature of his creating, he will make
himself manifest unto all.

27:31 Yea, <18 knee <872 bow, and <5 tongue confess <488 him.
Yea, even at the last day, when all men <18 <919 to be judged of
him, then <9 they <24 that he is God; then <8 they confess,
who live without God in the world, that the judgment of an <168
punishment is just upon <519 and they <25 quake, and tremble, and
shrink beneath the glance of his all-searching eye.

27:32 And now it came to pass that Alma <387 from this time forward to
teach the <330 and <512 who were with Alma at the time the <691
<1082 unto <407 traveling round <1098 <253 all the land,
publishing to all the <478 the <824 <170 they had <976 and seen,
and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, <354 greatly
persecuted by <50 who were unbelievers, <9 smitten by many of
<840

27:33 But notwithstanding all <353 they did impart much consolation to
the <1054 confirming <399 faith, and exhorting them with
long-suffering and much travail to keep the commandments of God.

27:34 And four of them were the sons of Mosiah; and <31 names were
Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni; <852 were the <13 of the
sons of Mosiah.

27:35 And they traveled throughout all the lands of Zarahemla, and
among all the <123 who were under the reign of king Mosiah, zealously
striving to repair all the injuries <137 they had done to the <95
confessing all <66 <550 and <157 all the <154 <17 they had
<153 and explaining the prophecies and the scriptures to all who
desired to hear <142

27:36 And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in bringing
many to the <1130 of the truth, yea, to the <7 of <56
Redeemer.

27:37 And how blessed are they! For they did publish peace; they did
<5 good tidings of good; and they did declare unto the <114 that
the Lord reigneth.

Mosiah Chapter 28

28:1 Now it came to pass that <523 the sons of <17 had done all
<173 things, they took a small number with them and returned to <74
father, the king, and <113 of him that he <793 grant unto them that
they might, with <32 whom they had selected, go up to the land of
Nephi that they <791 preach the <162 <162 they had heard, and that
they <12 <283 the word of God to <54 brethren, the Lamanites—

28:2 That perhaps they <18 bring them to the <146 of the Lord
<21 God, and <1278 them of the iniquity of <9 <524 and that
<26 they <26 cure them of <11 hatred towards the Nephites, that
they <12 also be <1322 to rejoice in the Lord <17 God, that they
<14 <716 friendly to one another, and that <1094 <929 be no more
contentions in all the land <97 the Lord <27 God had given <247

28:3 Now they were desirous that salvation <28 be declared to <558
creature, for they <1072 not bear that any human soul <16 perish;
yea, even the very thoughts that any soul <11 endure endless torment
did <1141 them to quake and tremble.

28:4 And thus did the Spirit of the Lord work upon <500 for they were
the very vilest of sinners. And the Lord saw fit in his infinite <756
to spare <575 nevertheless they suffered much anguish of soul <794
of <101 iniquities, suffering much and fearing that they <67 be
cast off forever.

28:5 And it came to pass that they did plead with <28 <1131 many
days that they <158 go up to the land of Nephi.

28:6 And king <306 went and inquired of the Lord if he <50 let his
sons go up <465 the Lamanites to <273 the word.

28:7 And the Lord said unto Mosiah: Let them go up, for many <671
believe on <64 words, and they <8 have <810 life; and I will
deliver thy sons out of the <442 of the Lamanites.

28:8 And it came to pass that <75 granted that they <93 go and do
<1554 to <43 request.

28:9 And they took <9 journey into the wilderness to go up to <84
the word <92 the Lamanites; and I <66 give an account of <23
proceedings hereafter.

28:10 Now king <53 had no one to confer the <1007 upon, for <302
was not any of his sons who <425 accept of the kingdom.

28:11 Therefore he took the records <314 were engraven on the plates
of brass, and also the <7 of Nephi, and all the <430 <19 he had
kept and preserved <103 to the <692 of God, <503 having
translated and <1294 to be written the <43 <24 were on the
<36 of gold <8 had been found by the <550 of Limhi, <9 were
<1600 to him by the hand of Limhi;

28:12 And this he did <292 of the <1463 anxiety of his people; for
they were <390 beyond measure to know <1769 <803 <41 who
had been destroyed.

28:13 And now he <76 them by the means of <20 two stones <60
were fastened into the two rims of a bow.

28:14 Now <566 <119 were prepared from the beginning, and were
handed down from generation to generation, for the <1809 of
interpreting languages;

28:15 And they have been kept and <144 by the hand of the Lord,
that he <331 discover to <474 <1055 who <6 possess the land
the iniquities and abominations of his <110

28:16 And whosoever has <68 <68 is called seer, <177 the manner
of old times.

28:17 Now <12 <255 had finished translating <22 records, <1839
it gave an <278 of the <138 who were destroyed, from the time that
they were destroyed back to the building of the <172 tower, at the
time the Lord confounded the language of the <31 and they were
scattered abroad upon the face of all the <1734 yea, and even from
that time back <1628 the creation of Adam.

28:18 Now this <67 did <565 the <37 of <84 to mourn
exceedingly, yea, they were filled with sorrow; <537 it gave
them much knowledge, in the <206 they did rejoice.

28:19 And this <36 <385 be <299 hereafter; for <114 it is
expedient that all <45 <165 know the <148 <28 are <17 in
this account.

28:20 And now, as I said unto you, that <152 king <69 had done
<153 <841 he took the <336 of <378 and all the <37 <37 he
had kept, and conferred them upon <1627 who was the son of Alma; yea,
all the <184 and also the interpreters, and <20 them upon
him, and commanded him that he <77 keep and preserve <674 and also
keep a record of the <1198 handing them down from one <297 to
<777 even as they had been <309 down from the time that Lehi left
Jerusalem.

<93 <952 29

29:1 Now when <9 had done this he sent out <1102 all the <1223
<542 all the <52 desiring to know <539 will <402 who <73
be <7 king.

29:2 And it came to pass that the <1948 of the <170 came, <2278 We
are <434 that Aaron thy son <30 be our king and our ruler.

29:3 Now <15 had gone up to the land of <536 <1905 the king
<842 not <585 the <585 upon him; neither <577 <22 take upon
him the kingdom; <9 were any of the sons of <101 willing to take
upon them the <596

29:4 <596 king <15 sent <2053 <107 the <402 yea, even a
<247 word sent he <11 the <2323 And <232 were the <2097 that
were written, <98

29:5 <2328 O ye my <136 or my <1026 for I esteem you as such,
I desire that ye <113 consider the <344 <256 ye are <443 to
consider—for ye are <131 to have a <156

29:6 Now I <1163 unto you that he to whom the <116 doth rightly
belong has declined, and will not take upon him the <103

29:7 And now if <720 <55 be another appointed in his stead, <1639
I fear <12 <147 rise <1031 <106 you. And who knoweth but what
my son, to whom the <51 doth belong, <31 turn to be angry and
draw away a part of this <223 <370 him, <98 <36 <101 wars and
<39 <39 you, <9 <9 be the <11 of shedding much blood
and perverting the way of the <595 yea, and <2294 the souls of many
<170

29:8 Now I say unto you let us be wise and <150 <184 <416 for
we have no right to <31 my son, <236 <79 we have any <10 to
<11 <116 if he <11 be <120 in his stead.

29:9 And if my son <14 turn <240 to his pride and vain <451 he
<89 recall the <6 <94 he had said, and claim his <43 to the
kingdom, <12 <17 <104 him and also this <125 to commit much sin.

29:10 And now let us be wise and look <1647 to <91 <91 and do
that <32 will make for the peace of this <121

29:11 <314 I will be your king the remainder of my days;
nevertheless, let us appoint judges, to judge this <58 <900 to
our law; and we will newly arrange the affairs of this <312 for we
will <25 wise men to be <29 that will <30 this <30
<31 to the <931 of God.

29:12 Now it is better that a man <141 be <1807 of God than of man,
for the judgments of God are always just, but the <8 of man are
not <10 just.

29:13 Therefore, if it were possible that you <457 have just men to be
your kings, who <161 <2752 the laws of God, and <76 this <76
<76 to his commandments, yea, if ye <28 have men for your kings
who <26 do even as my <1234 Benjamin did for this people—I say unto
you, if this <25 <67 be the case then it <24 be <728 that
ye <104 <13 have <36 to rule over you.

29:14 And even I myself have labored with all the <2402 and faculties
<211 I have possessed, to <1868 you the <151 of God, and to
<94 <221 <635 the <634 that <414 <46 be no wars nor
contentions, no stealing, nor plundering, nor murdering, nor any <928
of iniquity;

29:15 And <946 has committed iniquity, him have I punished
<124 to the crime <58 he has committed, <8 to the law
<9 has been <1481 to us by our fathers.

29:16 Now I say unto you, that <1110 all men are not just it is not
<125 that ye <78 have a king or <126 to rule over you.

29:17 For <875 how much <1588 doth one wicked king <363 to be
<65 yea, and what <979 destruction!

29:18 Yea, <2796 king Noah, his wickedness and his abominations, and
also the <8 and <1061 of his <357 Behold what <27
destruction did come upon <1487 and also <80 of <768 <1081
they were <1620 into bondage.

29:19 And were it not for the interposition of <20 all-wise Creator,
and this <28 of <8 sincere repentance, they must unavoidably
remain in bondage <1020 now.

29:20 But <99 he did <1425 them <24 they did humble
<2577 <2174 him; and <9 they <3091 mightily unto him he did
<20 them out of bondage; and thus doth the Lord work with his <253
in all cases <605 the children of men, extending the arm of <1591
<1721 them that put <73 trust in him.

29:21 And <65 now I say unto you, ye cannot dethrone an iniquitous
king save it be <2136 much contention, and the <642 of much
blood.

29:22 For <31 he has his friends in <267 and he keepeth his
guards <2165 him; and he teareth up the laws of <1317 who have reigned
in righteousness <114 him; and he trampleth <2050 his feet the
<340 of God;

29:23 And he enacteth laws, and sendeth them forth <109 his <528
yea, laws <729 the <335 of his own wickedness; and <332 doth
not obey his laws he causeth to be destroyed; and <13 doth rebel
<3332 him he will send his armies <7 them to war, and if he can
he will <700 <250 and thus an unrighteous king doth pervert the
ways of all righteousness.

29:24 And now <831 I say unto you, it is not <345 that such
<294 <347 come upon you.

29:25 <552 choose you by the <1046 of this <97 <616 that
ye may be <596 <408 to the laws <407 have been <407 you by our
fathers, <9 are correct, and <4 were <12 them by the hand of
the Lord.

29:26 Now it is not common that the <50 of the <584 desireth
anything contrary to that <32 is right; but it is <19 for the
lesser part of the <21 to <998 that <18 is not <19 <1093
this <1310 ye observe and make it your law—to do your business by the
<49 of the <407

29:27 And if the time comes that the <15 of the <43 doth <123
<265 then is the time that the <697 of God will come upon
you; yea, then is the time he will visit you with <448 <447
even as he has hitherto visited this land.

29:28 And now if ye have <162 and they do not <704 you <162 to
the law <100 has been given, ye can <521 that they may be <179 of a
higher judge.

29:29 If your <8 judges do not <34 righteous judgments, ye <124
<27 that a <2233 <2233 of your lower <17 <233 be <3071
together, and they <18 <23 your <29 <65 <59 to the
<122 of the <137

29:30 And I command you to do <926 <966 in the fear of the <2940 and
I <15 you to do <15 <941 and that ye have no king; that if
<11 <160 <971 sins and <571 they <56 be <3479 upon
<478 own heads.

29:31 For <322 I say unto you, the sins of many <28 have been
<1834 by the <31 of <26 kings; <234 <3 <6 are
<36 upon the heads of <9 kings.

29:32 And now I <259 that this inequality <119 be no more in this
<787 especially <444 this my <1315 but I <19 that this land be a
land of liberty, and <1745 man may enjoy his rights and privileges
alike, so long as the Lord sees fit that we may live and <2984 the
<44 yea, even as long as any of our posterity remains upon the face
of the <251

29:33 And many more <164 did king <1387 write unto <1552 unfolding
unto them all the trials and troubles of a <227 <2442 yea, all the
travails of soul for <117 <441 and also all the murmurings of the
<148 to <12 <184 and he explained it all unto <2332

29:34 And he told them that <197 <59 ought not to be; but that the
burden <145 come upon all the <45 that <126 man <2137 bear his
part.

29:35 And he also unfolded unto them all the disadvantages they <979
under, by <2045 an <560 king to rule over <569

29:36 Yea, all his <213 and <848 and all the wars, and
<972 and bloodshed, and the <975 and the <976 and
the committing of whoredoms, and all <645 of <28 <382 <735
be enumerated—telling them that <94 <94 <94 not to be, that they
were expressly repugnant to the <692 of God.

29:37 And now it came to pass, <684 king <178 had sent <32 <32
<699 <255 the <152 they were convinced of the truth of his words.

29:38 <1276 they relinquished <167 desires for a <192 and <3555
exceedingly anxious that <142 man <151 have an equal chance
<1084 all the land; yea, and <14 man expressed a willingness to
answer for his own sins.

29:39 <668 it came to pass that they assembled <907
<3521 in bodies <35 the <288 to cast in <60 voices
<1749 who <52 be <7 <459 to <464 them <462 to the
law <139 had been <672 <180 and they were <77 rejoiced
<942 of the liberty <15 had been <2364 unto <256

29:40 And they did wax strong in love <925 <2942 yea, they did
<1665 him more than any other man; for they did not look upon him as a
tyrant who was seeking for gain, yea, for that lucre <50 doth corrupt
the soul; for he had not exacted riches of <356 <1533 had he
delighted in the <945 of blood; but he had established <1236 in the
<118 and he had <83 unto his <198 that they <119 be <2307
from all <255 of <1033 <499 they did <81 him, yea,
<2074 <2293 measure.

29:41 And it came to pass that they did <1454 <619 to rule over
<66 or to <154 them <154 to the law; and this they did
<181 all the <453

29:42 And it came to pass that Alma was <1614 to be the first chief
judge, he <3146 also the high priest, his <1397 <373 <2035 the
office upon him, and <8 <196 him the charge <217 all the
<1531 of the church.

29:43 And now it came to pass that Alma did walk in the ways of the
<1722 and he did keep his <1462 and he did <94 <508
judgments; and <1384 was continual <156 <1114 the <91

29:44 And thus commenced the <3124 of the <125 <107 all the
land of <3145 <368 all the <171 who were <1889 the Nephites;
and Alma was the <108 and <109 <794

29:45 And now it came to pass that his <113 died, <121 eighty and
two years old, <113 lived to fulfil the <434 of God.

29:46 And it came to pass that <432 died also, in the thirty and
third year of his reign, <38 sixty and three <37 old; making in the
whole, five hundred and nine <11 from the time Lehi left <2160

29:47 And thus ended the <111 of the <1429 over the <103 of <4199
and thus <14 the days of <2249 who was the founder of <404 <185




 THE BOOK OF ALMA

THE SON OF ALMA

The <2346 of <35 who was the son of Alma the first, and <145 <193
over the <60 of <2151 and also the high priest over the Church. An
<30 of the <82 of the <466 and the wars and <1972 <191
the <926 And also an <19 of a war between the Nephites and the
Lamanites, <332 to the <2308 of <63 the <202 and <57 <202

Alma <2288 1

1:1 Now it came to pass that in the <22 year of the <60 of the
<254 over the <83 of <83 from this time forward, king <200
<220 gone the way of all the <2519 <8 warred a good warfare,
walking uprightly <1367 God, leaving none to <38 in his stead;
<2501 he had <468 <1361 and they were acknowledged by the
<917 <454 they were obliged to abide by the laws <514 he had
made.

1:2 And it came to pass that in the <86 year of the <48 of Alma in
the judgment-seat, <361 was a man <1596 <65 him to be judged, a
man who was large, and was noted for his much strength.

1:3 And he had gone <1474 <176 the <851 <3622 to them that
<68 he termed to be the word of God, bearing down <1415 the church;
declaring unto the <144 that <719 <223 and teacher <801 to <3266
popular; and they <7 not to labor with <289 hands, but that they
<11 to be supported by the <229

1:4 And he also testified unto the <41 that all mankind <603 be
saved at the last day, and that they need not fear nor <3776 but
that they <936 lift up <50 <1109 and rejoice; for the Lord had
created all men, and had also <3963 all men; and, in the end, all
men <48 have <3133 life.

1:5 And it came to pass that he did <1927 <875 <875 so much that
many did <3164 on his <3164 even so many that they <3820 to support
him and give him money.

1:6 And he <15 to be lifted up in the <2237 of his heart, and to wear
very costly apparel, yea, and even <21 to <1974 a <4612 <938
the <723 of his preaching.

1:7 And it came to pass as he was going, to <3172 to <1683 who
believed on his word, he met a man who belonged to the <39 of God,
yea, even one of <146 teachers; and he <55 to contend with him
sharply, that he <162 lead away the <190 of the <239 but the man
withstood him, admonishing him with the <2557 of God.

1:8 Now the name of the man was Gideon; and it was he who was an
instrument in the <3297 of God in delivering the <46 of Limhi out of
<1931

1:9 Now, <943 Gideon <52 him with the <50 of God he was
wroth with Gideon, and drew his sword and <91 to smite him. Now
<25 <639 stricken with many years, <416 he was not able to
withstand his blows, <10 he was slain by the sword.

1:10 And the man who slew him was <4626 by the <75 of the <3865
and was <413 <413 <540 to be <1539 <549 to the crimes <387
he had committed.

1:11 And it came to pass that he <4468 <26 Alma and pleaded for
<4182 with much boldness.

1:12 But Alma said unto him: <2707 this is the <478 time that
priestcraft has been introduced <443 this <389 And <1935 thou art
not only guilty of priestcraft, but hast endeavored to enforce it by
the sword; and were <29 to be enforced <29 this <96 it
<2305 prove <239 entire destruction.

1:13 And thou hast shed the <2629 of a <891 man, yea, a man who
has done much good <33 this <577 and were we to <3634 thee his
<25 <40 come upon us for vengeance.

1:14 <1246 thou art condemned to die, <142 to the law <142
has been <981 us by <4043 our last <1429 and it has been
<627 by this <49 <200 this <85 must <625 by the
law.

1:15 And it came to pass that they took him; and his name was Nehor;
and they <4829 him upon the top of the hill Manti, and <629 he was
caused, or rather did acknowledge, <771 the heavens and the <712
that what he had taught to the <61 was <1903 to the word of God;
and <33 he <3750 an ignominious death.

1:16 <4535 this did not put an end to the spreading of
<184 <1042 the <1349 for <27 were many who loved the vain
<528 of the <4376 and they went <1408 <670 false doctrines; and
this they did for the sake of <1248 and honor.

1:17 <52 they durst not lie, if it were known, for fear of
the law, for liars were punished; <154 they pretended to <500
<184 to <240 belief; and now the law <2560 have no <2276 on any
man for his belief.

1:18 And they <48 not steal, for fear of the law, for such were
<44 <1315 <14 they rob, nor murder, for he that murdered was
<2512 unto <134

1:19 But it came to pass that <2187 did not <3004 to the <554 of
God <455 to persecute <576 that did <13 to the <13 of God, and
had <430 upon them the name of Christ.

1:20 Yea, they did <27 <1315 and afflict them with all <629 of
<682 and this <517 of <115 humility; <4 they were not proud
in <9 own eyes, and <11 they did <4152 the word of God, one
with <3309 <4571 money and <3 price.

1:21 Now <212 was a strict law <369 the <256 of the <80 that
<13 <764 not any man, belonging to the <509 <5546 and <74
<102 that did not <103 to the <12 and that <23 <23 be no
persecution <37 themselves.

1:22 <225 <13 were many <10 them who <134 to be proud,
and <6 to <686 warmly with <92 adversaries, even unto blows;
yea, they <426 <607 one <3030 with <13 fists.

1:23 Now this was in the second year of the <1002 of <578 and it was a
<2098 of much affliction to the <717 yea, it was the <11 of much
trial with the <1233

1:24 For the hearts of many were hardened, and <54 <4535 were blotted
out, that they were remembered no more <93 the <140 of God. And
also many withdrew <1691 from <12 <1646

1:25 Now this was a <2228 <51 to <144 that did <4776 fast in the
faith; <3031 they were steadfast and immovable in keeping the
<1381 of God, and they bore with patience the <157 <531
was heaped upon <46

1:26 And when the <5235 left <81 <1042 to <236 the word of God
unto the <1092 the <80 also left <16 labors to hear the word of
God. And when the <1082 had imparted unto them the word of God they
all <4475 <3189 diligently unto <28 labors; and the <1583 not
esteeming <717 above his hearers, for the preacher was no <3074
than the hearer, <394 was the <1121 any <10 than the learner;
and thus they were all equal, and they did all labor, <1142 man
<456 to his <1186

1:27 And they did <98 of <59 substance, <18 man <17 to
that <126 he had, to the poor, and the needy, and the sick, and the
afflicted; and they did not wear <1031 <1031 yet they were neat and
comely.

1:28 And thus they did <1041 the <1666 of the <260 and thus
they <312 to have <1636 <1636 <5855 <4838 all <64
persecutions.

1:29 And now, <412 of the steadiness of the <386 they <25 to be
<1902 rich, <1373 abundance of all <612 whatsoever they <869
in need—an <10 of flocks and herds, and fatlings of <104 kind,
and also <13 of grain, and of gold, and of silver, and of
precious <2382 and <15 of silk and fine-twined linen, and all
<495 of good homely cloth.

1:30 And thus, in <83 prosperous circumstances, they did not send
away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or
that were <153 or that had not been nourished; and they did not set
<38 <376 upon riches; <664 they were liberal to all, both old
and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the
<134 or in the <501 <131 no respect to persons as to <372 who
<134 in need.

1:31 And thus they did prosper and <1393 far more wealthy than <21
who did not <538 to <68 <451

1:32 For <14 who did not <13 to <13 <54 did indulge
<433 in sorceries, and in idolatry or idleness, and in babblings,
and in envyings and strife; wearing <260 apparel; <1135 <1307 up in
the <1308 of <33 own eyes; persecuting, lying, thieving, robbing,
<2279 <2278 and <3260 and all <178 of <2923
<455 the law was put in force upon all <66 who did
transgress it, inasmuch as it was possible.

1:33 And it came to pass that by thus exercising the law upon <719
<249 man <4651 <354 to that <353 he had done, they <2262
more still, and <801 not <2619 any <3209 if it were known;
<6126 <650 was much <325 <546 the <478 of <4894 <3168 the
fifth year of the <621 of the judges.

Alma <1735 2

2:1 And it came to pass in the commencement of the <28 year of <126
<29 <46 <348 to be a contention <48 the <1066 for a certain
man, <151 <1990 Amlici, he <4 a very cunning man, yea, a wise man
as to the wisdom of the <980 he <18 <1457 the order of the man that
slew <1319 by the sword, who was executed <123 to the law—

2:2 Now this Amlici had, by his cunning, drawn away much <111 <35
him; even so much that they <79 to be very powerful; and they <7
to endeavor to <474 <30 to be king over the <1268

2:3 Now this was alarming to the <39 of the <324 and also to all
<221 who had not been <56 away <54 the persuasions of Amlici; for
they knew that <83 to <141 law that such <479 must be
<1839 by the <2865 of the <53

2:4 <2446 if it were <3666 that <70 <872 gain the <18 of
the <691 he, <137 a <3466 man, <848 deprive them of <43 <2764
and <2765 of the <565 for it was his intent to <3194 the
<359 of God.

2:5 And it came to pass that the <102 <2495 <371 <2494
<2205 all the <2376 <294 man <87 to his mind, <447 it
were for or <1828 <218 in separate bodies, <448 much <6371 and
wonderful <2035 one with another.

2:6 And thus they did <6022 <43 <43 to cast in <81
<2533 <2315 the matter; and they were laid <1474 the <301

2:7 And it came to pass that the <119 of the <77 came <58
<59 that he was not made king over the <150

2:8 Now this did <942 much joy in the <557 of <198 who were <29
him; but <161 did stir up <11 who were in his favor to anger
<17 <10 who were not in his favor.

2:9 And it came to pass that they <3086 <100 <3086 and did
consecrate <39 to be <104 <4221

2:10 Now when <11 was made king over them he <4472 them that
they <222 take up arms <53 <25 brethren; and this he did that
he <1761 subject them to him.

2:11 Now the <122 of <39 were distinguished by the name of <127
<249 <408 Amlicites; and the <4029 were <6 <5295 or the
<23 of God.

2:12 <1528 the <9 of the <2223 were aware of the <258 of
the Amlicites, and <696 they did prepare to meet <2712 yea, they
did arm <112 with swords, and with cimeters, and with bows, and
with arrows, and with stones, and with slings, and with all <606 of
weapons of war, of <277 kind.

2:13 And thus they were <4883 to meet the Amlicites at the time of
<127 coming. And <521 were <2602 captains, and <3248 <3
and <2293 <4 <309 to <16 numbers.

2:14 And it came to pass that <133 did arm his men with all <62 of
<62 of war of <62 kind; and he also <42 rulers and leaders
over his <401 to lead them to war <188 <45 brethren.

2:15 And it came to pass that the <80 came upon the hill Amnihu,
<666 was east of the river Sidon, <7 ran by the land of <2594
and <94 they <530 to make war with the Nephites.

2:16 Now <1278 <208 the <102 <2452 and the governor of the <196 of
<2372 <186 he went up with his <77 yea, with his <122
and <24 <4 yea, at the head of his armies, <87 the
<76 to battle.

2:17 And they <60 to slay the <13 upon the hill east of Sidon.
And the <10 did <1375 with the <250 with <1276 <6373
insomuch that many of the <10 did fall <437 the Amlicites.

2:18 <6991 the Lord did strengthen the hand of the <295
that they slew the <40 with <35 slaughter, that they <60 to
flee <32 <1283

2:19 And it came to pass that the <48 did pursue the <27 all
that day, and did slay them with much <35 <69 that <157
were <2029 of the <20 twelve thousand five <2681 <2702 and two
souls; and <17 were <16 of the <40 six <16 five <16
<2710 and two souls.

2:20 And it came to pass that when Alma <1705 <61 the <41 no
longer he <3467 that his <188 <442 pitch <251 tents in the valley
of <2122 the <5 <210 <412 <716 that <798 who was <56 by
the hand of Nehor with the <2005 and in this <21 the <68 did
<36 <36 <36 for the night.

2:21 And Alma sent spies to follow the remnant of the <430 that
he <489 know of <26 plans and <3 plots, whereby he <10 guard
<1381 <238 <979 that he <8 <4992 his <83 from <72
<5325

2:22 Now <582 whom he had sent out to watch the camp of the <113
were <94 Zeram, and Amnor, and <1959 and Limher; <2421 were they
who went out with <56 men to <27 the camp of the <248

2:23 And it came to pass that on the morrow they <1465 into the camp
of the <119 in <250 haste, <73 <6210 astonished, and struck
with much fear, <4889

2:24 <2182 we followed the camp of the <121 and to our <27
<7309 in the land of Minon, <1496 the land of <410 in the
course of the land of <389 we saw a numerous host of the <5604
and <2209 the <112 have joined <584

2:25 And they are upon our brethren in that <2019 and they are fleeing
<325 them with <118 flocks, and <3 wives, and <3 children,
<3299 our city; and except we make haste they obtain possession of
our city, and our <4024 and our <25 and our <4256 be slain.

2:26 And it came to pass that the <205 of <1155 took <44 tents, and
departed out of the <267 of <285 <52 <12 <40 <527 was the
city of Zarahemla.

2:27 And <103 as they were crossing the <547 <547 the <5811
and the <152 <174 as <126 almost, as it were, as the sands
of the sea, came upon them to <982 <436

2:28 <1880 the <204 <27 strengthened by the hand of the
<3216 <957 <6888 <4378 to him that he <1025 <4378 them out of
the <2526 of <80 enemies, <570 the Lord did hear <7 cries,
and did <503 <320 and the <73 and the <186 did fall
<168 <57

2:29 And it came to pass that Alma fought with <703 with the <1203
face to face; and they did <567 mightily, one with <1017

2:30 And it came to pass that <646 <90 a man of God, <5 exercised
with much <6476 cried, <294 O <96 have <4440 and <2396 my life,
that I may be an <2623 in thy <97 to save and <402 this
<1011

2:31 Now when Alma had said <380 <2617 he contended <1817 with <1199
and he was strengthened, <565 that he slew <90 with the <2593

2:32 And he also <24 with the king of the <317 but the king
of the <136 fled back from <133 Alma and sent his <4462 to
<115 with Alma.

2:33 But <108 with his guards, <37 with the <18 of the king
of the <34 <1435 he slew and drove them back.

2:34 And thus he cleared the ground, or <2427 the bank, <286 was on
the west of the <276 <276 throwing the <3708 of the <37 who
had been <592 into the waters of <16 that thereby his <333 <542
have room to cross and <81 with the <25 and the <232 on
the west side of the <43 <784

2:35 And it came to pass that when they had all crossed the <18 Sidon
that the <34 and the <34 <760 to flee <133 <277
<1869 they were so <346 that they <694 not be numbered.

2:36 And they fled <21 the <338 <394 the <6102 <108 was
west and north, away <3663 the borders of the <479 and the <19
did <728 them with <330 <6495 and did slay <318

2:37 Yea, they were met on <1003 hand, and <127 and driven, <171 they
were <5815 on the west, and on the <48 <12 they had reached
the wilderness, <61 was <655 Hermounts; and it was that part of the
<74 <13 was infested by wild and ravenous beasts.

2:38 And it came to pass that many died in the <23 of <77
wounds, and were devoured by <712 beasts and also the vultures of the
air; and <18 bones have been found, and have been <2194 up on the
earth.

Alma <1683 3

3:1 And it came to pass that the <132 who were not <112 by the
<1126 of war, <843 <491 buried <56 who had been slain—now the
<4432 of the <20 were not numbered, <2057 of the greatness of
<65 number—after they had <6002 burying <6 dead they all
<745 to <7 lands, and to <4 houses, and <3 <631 and
<4 children.

3:2 Now many women and <641 had been <47 with the <496 and also
many of <22 <2083 and <3 herds; and also many of <6 fields of
grain were <6044 for they were trodden down by the hosts of men.

3:3 And now as many of the <297 and the <297 who had been
<53 upon the bank of the <316 <316 were cast into the <368 of
Sidon; and <4471 <53 <173 are in the depths of the sea, and they
are many.

3:4 And the <43 were <1423 from the <1116 for they
had marked <1378 with red in <35 foreheads <168 the <1302 of
the <503 <3556 they had not shorn <14 <3385 like unto
the <6482

3:5 Now the <12 of the <91 were shorn; and they were <2156
save it were skin <292 was girded <3511 <32 loins, and also <4
armor, <11 was <11 <11 <407 and <9 <1434 and <3 <1433
and <4 <1434 and <3 <1434 and so forth.

3:6 And the skins of the <53 were dark, <1405 to the mark
<38 was set upon <26 <852 <6 was a curse upon them <252
of <11 <8189 and <3 rebellion <1059 <3 <5847 who
consisted of <938 Jacob, and Joseph, and Sam, who were just and holy
men.

3:7 And <24 <931 sought to <814 <84 <780 they were
cursed; and the Lord God set a mark upon <14 yea, upon Laman and
Lemuel, and also the sons of Ishmael, and Ishmaelitish women.

3:8 And this was done that <44 seed <584 be <197 from the
seed of <10 <78 that <598 the Lord God <15 <739 his
<1403 that they <7 not mix and <3529 in incorrect traditions
<116 <863 <3202 <26 <3201

3:9 And it came to pass that <2913 did mingle his seed with that of
the <155 did <6989 the same <143 upon his seed.

3:10 <1945 <24 <3086 <1203 to be led away by the
<24 was <525 <5184 that head, and <1331 was a mark set upon
him.

3:11 And it came to pass that <35 <74 not <82 in the
tradition of the <3921 but <3544 <463 <6624 <89 were
<3385 out of the land of Jerusalem, and also in the <22 of
<103 <224 <19 were <5100 who <26 in the <2735 of
God and kept <179 were <72 the <348 or the <744 of <225
from that time forth—

3:12 And it is they who have kept the <60 <41 are true of <47
<167 and also of the <32 of the <356

3:13 Now we will return <909 to the <1081 for they also had a
mark set upon <1202 yea, they set the mark upon themselves, yea, even a
mark of red upon <48 foreheads.

3:14 Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for <956 are the <958 <70
he said to Nephi: <1290 the <178 have I cursed, and I will set a
mark on them that they and <42 seed may be separated from thee and
thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever, <1242 they repent of
<22 <2383 and turn to me that I may have <1047 upon <788

3:15 And again: I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with
thy <320 that they may be cursed also.

3:16 And <27 I will set a mark upon him that fighteth <422 thee
and thy <292

3:17 And <2762 I say he that departeth from thee <5072 no more be
<221 thy seed; and I will bless <8459 and whomsoever <15 be <12
thy <106 <103 and forever; and <149 were the promises of the
Lord unto <1320 and to his <52

3:18 Now the <612 knew not that they were fulfilling the <174 of
God when they <965 to mark <618 in <138 foreheads; <609
they had come out in open <516 <94 God; <487 it was
<5454 that the <393 <1660 fall upon <150

3:19 Now I <359 that ye <13 see that they <349 upon <42
the curse; and even so doth <952 man that is <152 <429 upon <417
his own condemnation.

3:20 Now it came to pass that not many days <687 the battle <260 was
<1299 in the land of <1529 by the <263 and the <318
that <440 was <3230 army of the <12 came in upon the <347 of
<380 in the same place where the <3760 army met the <1626

3:21 And it came to pass that <36 was an army sent to drive them out
of <140 <4609

3:22 Now Alma <93 <1335 afflicted with a wound did not go up to
<85 at this time <153 the <774

3:23 But he sent up a <1136 army <14 <397 and they went up and
slew many of the <509 and <1257 the <2234 of them out of the
<1132 of <63 <63

3:24 And then they <960 <444 and <220 to <2592 <2728 in the
<2469 <74 troubled no more for a time with <28 enemies.

3:25 Now all <278 <2565 were <2773 yea, all <6 wars and
<2472 were <4712 and <4589 in the <2729 year of the <2728 of
the <2457

3:26 And in one year were thousands and tens of <4 of <6486 sent
to the <4245 <2719 that they <701 reap <60 rewards <823 to
<5 works, <2538 they were good or <5 they were bad, to reap
<25 happiness or <3 misery, <22 to the spirit <243 they
listed to obey, <22 it be a good <12 or a bad one.

3:27 For <292 man receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to <26 and
this <39 to the <368 of the <30 of prophecy; <350 let it
be <14 to the truth. And thus endeth the <120 year of the <120
of the <120

Alma <1195 4

4:1 Now it came to pass in the sixth year of the <26 of the <4611
over the <309 of <308 <287 were no <170 nor wars in the
land of Zarahemla;

4:2 But the <21 were afflicted, yea, <1919 <289 for the loss
of <149 <551 and also for the loss of <8 <1166 and <3249 and
also for the loss of <11 <1168 of <3249 <149 were <1164 <822
foot and <7209 by the <718

4:3 And so <1942 were <23 afflictions that <150 soul had <2650 to
mourn; and they <790 that it was the <5795 of God sent upon
them <1024 of <26 <651 and <3 abominations; <155 they
were awakened to a remembrance of <11 duty.

4:4 And they <320 to <320 the <2808 more fully; yea, and many
were baptized in the <1207 of <1214 and were <1976 to the <19 of
God; yea, they were <18 by the hand of <1654 who had been
consecrated the high <3548 over the <147 of the <2938 by the hand
of his <5009 <1682

4:5 And it came to pass in the seventh year of the <202 of the <202
<197 were <1175 <4991 <2288 five <2288 <340 that united
<584 to the <69 of God and were baptized. And thus <261 the
<34 year of the <34 of the <34 over the <67 of <4990 and
<40 was <3491 <438 in all that time.

4:6 And it came to pass in the eighth year of the <34 of the <4942
that the <35 of the <59 <152 to wax <3844 <180 of <166
exceeding riches, and <5 fine silks, and <4 <3468 <3468
and <16 of <7 many <257 and <257 and <6 gold and <3
<3496 and all <1335 of <3497 <3497 <259 they had obtained by
<15 industry; and in all <493 <499 were they <3345 up in the
<3345 of <16 <3986 for they <66 to wear very <3363 apparel.

4:7 Now this was the <274 of much <3877 to <202 yea, and to many
of the <97 whom Alma had <209 to be teachers, and priests,
and elders over the <3074 yea, many of them were sorely grieved for
the <292 <80 they saw had begun to be <3275 <66 <1970

4:8 For they saw and <9246 with <342 sorrow that the <51 of the
<149 <83 to be <97 up in the <96 of <30 <96 and to set
<6 <3004 upon <4250 and upon the vain <120 of the <576 that
they <30 to be scornful, one <1814 <4095 and they <9 to
<4066 <1195 that did not <1209 <516 to <35 own will and
pleasure.

4:9 And <3647 in this <228 year of the <228 of the <228 <255
<35 to be <86 <495 <101 the <86 of the <125 yea,
<15 were envyings, and strife, and malice, and persecutions, and
pride, even to exceed the <96 of <62 who did not <3576 to the
<114 of God.

4:10 And thus <705 the <60 year of the <60 of the judges; and the
<165 of the <25 was a <64 stumbling-block to <39 who did
not <40 to the <68 and thus the <18 <83 to fail in its
progress.

4:11 And it came to pass in the <3487 of the ninth year, Alma
saw the <49 of the <439 and he saw also that the example of
the <42 <42 to lead <58 who were unbelievers on from one piece
of <6809 to <178 thus <8571 on the <6327 of the <242

4:12 Yea, he saw <89 <6148 <153 the <1318 some lifting
<450 up with <191 <144 despising others, turning <5 backs
upon the needy and the naked and <54 who were <3827 and <5 who
were <3829 and <6 who were sick and afflicted.

4:13 Now this was a <51 <351 for lamentations <53 the <53
while others were abasing <1340 succoring <28 who <3800 in need
of <56 succor, such as imparting <5 substance to the poor and the
<4030 feeding the <59 and <3694 all <435 of afflictions, for
Christ’s sake, who <1132 come <284 to the <811 of <811

4:14 Looking <7276 to that day, thus retaining a remission of <45
sins; <968 <7859 with <77 joy <489 of the resurrection of the
dead, <36 to the will and <4562 and deliverance of Jesus Christ
from the bands of <4532

4:15 And now it came to pass that <460 <2014 seen the <748 of
the <6897 followers of God, and the persecutions <440 were <2065
upon them by the <1061 of his <135 and seeing all <74
inequality, <230 to be very sorrowful; <1268 the <8502 of the
Lord did not fail him.

4:16 And he selected a wise man who was <172 the <503 of the <275
and gave him <94 <100 to the <3488 of the <52 that he <1024
have <13 to enact laws <16 to the laws <77 had been <6565
and to put them in <3906 <15 to the <318 and the <5028 of
the <287

4:17 Now this man’s name was Nephihah, and he was <3261 <3171
judge; and he sat in the judgment-seat to <3204 and to govern the
<31

4:18 Now Alma did not <8804 unto him the <5915 of <200 high <815
over the <99 but he retained the <13 of high <12 unto
himself; but he <6022 the <45 unto Nephihah.

4:19 And this he did that he <1278 <114 go <4838 <137 his <122
or <5 the <520 of <1024 that he <15 <4809 the word of God unto
<1732 to stir them up in <931 of <196 duty, and that he <21
pull down, by the word of God, all the <535 and craftiness and all the
<567 <158 were <49 his <54 <227 no way that he <29
reclaim them save it were in <5564 down in pure testimony <1327
<1483

4:20 And thus in the <505 of the <505 year of the <559 of the
<882 over the <93 of <93 Alma <123 up the <124 to
<185 and confined <117 wholly to the high priesthood of the
holy <3981 of God, to the <54 of the <5419 <227 to the
<395 of revelation and prophecy.

Alma <1186 5

5:1 Now it came to pass that Alma <323 to <2854 the word of God unto
the <112 <1485 in the land of <1520 and from thence <3858
all the <1408

5:2 And <880 are the <1264 <140 he <10083 to the <97 in the <596
<10 was <3955 in the city of <35 <78 to his own
record, <2825

5:3 I, <420 <420 been <871 by my <9087 <7 to be a high
<260 over the <38 of God, he <19 <357 and <10300 from God
to do <63 <956 <3005 I say unto you that he <102 to <1155 a
<27 in the land <67 was in the <1502 of <1055 yea, the land
<11 was <1759 the land of Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his
<2203 in the <1177 of Mormon.

5:4 And <52 I say unto you, they were <208 out of the <2907 of
the <123 of king <7492 by the <1884 and <85 of God.

5:5 And <31 <1694 that, they were <1733 into <7446 by the <30
of the <1681 in the wilderness; yea, I say unto you, they were in
captivity, and <1582 the Lord did <209 them out of <30 by the
<49 of his word; and we were <43 into this <1595 and here we
<132 to <132 the <131 of God <221 this land <1931

5:6 And now <73 I say unto you, my <1399 you that <863 to
this <455 have you sufficiently <456 in <402 the
<10415 of your fathers? Yea, and have you <14 <14 in
<15 his <119 and <9528 <1007 them? And moreover,
have ye <16 <16 in <15 that he has <150
<436 <1275 from hell?

5:7 <2080 he <9963 <11 hearts; yea, he <1387 them out of a
deep sleep, and they awoke unto God. <20 they were in the midst of
darkness; <4509 <27 <38 were illuminated by the <9849 of
the <9725 <133 yea, they were encircled <1333 by the <733 of
<9920 and the chains of hell, and an <20 <908 did await
<460

5:8 And now I ask of you, my <134 were they destroyed? <61 I
say unto you, Nay, they were not.

5:9 And <203 I ask, were the <52 of death broken, and the <52 of
hell <303 <67 them about, were they loosed? I say unto you, Yea,
they were loosed, and <98 <98 did expand, and they did sing
redeeming love. And I say unto you that they are saved.

5:10 And now I ask of you on what conditions are they saved? Yea, what
grounds had they to hope for salvation? What is the <961 of <51
<692 loosed from the <84 of <135 yea, and also the <85 of <199

5:11 <118 I can tell you—did not my <1517 Alma <1227 in the <492
<102 were <225 by the <10330 of Abinadi? And was he not a holy
prophet? Did he not <10267 the <23 of God, and my <33 Alma <33
<266

5:12 And <511 to his <10809 <1232 was a mighty change wrought in
his heart. <7888 I say unto you that this is all true.

5:13 And <341 he preached the word unto your <2483 and a <32
<33 was also <35 in <116 hearts, and they humbled <1128
and put <9 <7815 in the true and living God. And <35 they were
faithful <3106 the end; <1705 they were <177

5:14 And now <18 I ask of you, my <515 of the <390 have ye
spiritually been born of God? Have ye <10397 his image in your
countenances? Have ye experienced this <74 <73 in your hearts?

5:15 Do ye exercise <122 in the redemption of him who <6261 you? Do
you look <1110 with an eye of <3475 and view this mortal body raised
in immortality, and this corruption <7 in incorruption, to <5350
<3259 God to be <6008 <167 to the deeds <207 have been done in
the <31 body?

5:16 I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the
<1042 of the <3529 saying unto you, in that day: Come unto me ye
blessed, for <133 your works have been the <4 of <7915
upon the face of the <10965

5:17 Or do ye <48 to <48 that ye can lie unto the Lord in
that day, and say—Lord, our <34 have been <5996 <4 upon the
face of the earth—and that he will save you?

5:18 Or otherwise, can ye <42 <41 <619 <121 the
tribunal of God with your <411 <1251 with guilt and remorse, <776 a
<563 of all your guilt, yea, a perfect <8 of all your
wickedness, yea, a <8 that ye have set at defiance the
<2764 of God?

5:19 I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure
heart and clean hands? I say unto you, can you look up, <64 the
<260 of God <9497 upon your <262

5:20 I say unto you, can ye think of <451 <6542 when you have yielded
<109 to <5197 subjects to the devil?

5:21 I say unto you, ye will know at that day that ye <7422 be saved;
for <414 can no man be <39 <2718 his garments are washed white;
yea, his <7 must be purified <368 they are cleansed from all
stain, <6024 the <6163 of him of whom it has been <10481 by our
<423 who <1446 come to redeem his <867 from <413 <7381

5:22 And now I ask of you, my <653 how will any of you feel, if ye
<2691 <332 <210 the bar of God, <137 your <67 stained with
<57 and all <1500 of filthiness? <560 what will <983 <1806
testify <1163 you?

5:23 <509 will they not <11 that ye are murderers, yea, and also
that ye are <6318 of all <35 of wickedness?

5:24 <39 my <70 do ye suppose that such an one can have a
<2603 to sit down in the <8975 of God, with Abraham, with Isaac, and
with <3227 and also all the holy prophets, whose <87 are <149
and are spotless, pure and white?

5:25 I say unto you, Nay; <182 ye make our Creator a liar from the
<9606 or <64 that he is a liar from the <10 ye <215
<12 that such can have <72 in the <69 of heaven; but they
<153 be cast out for they are the <3528 of the <17 of the
devil.

5:26 And now <451 I say unto you, my <121 if ye have
<566 a <565 of <6735 and if ye have felt to sing the song of
<805 love, I <2816 ask, can ye feel so now?

5:27 Have ye walked, <5887 <321 blameless <220 God? Could ye
say, if ye were <1161 to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye
have been <1001 humble? That your <152 have been <153
and made white <302 the <245 of Christ, who will come to <292 his
<293 from <293 sins?

5:28 <218 are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye
are not <4895 to meet God. <266 ye must <4950 quickly; for the
<142 of heaven is soon at <3857 and such an one hath not <2648
<6922

5:29 <50 I say, is <403 one <1490 you who is not <58 of envy?
I say unto you that such an one is not prepared; and I <149 that he
<388 <58 quickly, for the hour is close at <55 and he <9276
not when the time <223 come; for such an one is not <9953 guiltless.

5:30 And <1035 I say unto you, is <67 one <67 you that doth make a
mock of his brother, or that heapeth upon him persecutions?

5:31 Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time is at
hand that he must <3223 or he <306 be saved!

5:32 Yea, even wo unto all ye workers of <8939 repent, <1 for
the Lord God hath <503 it!

5:33 <147 he <8635 an invitation unto all men, for the arms of
<1253 are extended <1253 <1682 and he saith: Repent, and I will
<11337 you.

5:34 Yea, he <14 Come unto me and ye <137 partake of the fruit of
the tree of <10257 yea, ye <13 eat and drink of the bread and the
<1451 of life freely;

5:35 Yea, come unto me and <3138 <1763 <783 of <11242 and ye
<31 not be hewn down and cast into the fire—

5:36 For <397 the time is at hand that <3550 bringeth <31 not
good fruit, or <8 doeth not the <40 of <40 the same
have <1161 to wail and mourn.

5:37 O ye <153 of <153 ye that are puffed up in the vain <597
of the <2404 ye that have professed to have known the ways of
<904 <2009 have gone astray, as sheep <636 no
shepherd, <4253 a shepherd hath <420 <1527 you and is still
calling <7 you, but ye will not hearken unto his voice!

5:38 <200 I say unto you, that the good <32 doth call you; yea,
and in his own name he doth call you, <1016 is the name of Christ; and
if ye will not <43 unto the <1004 of the good <69 to the name
by <25 ye are called, <153 ye are not the <88 of the good
shepherd.

5:39 And now if ye are not the <17 of the good <36 of what fold
are ye? <85 I say unto you, that the devil is your <17 and ye
are of his fold; and now, who can deny this? <24 I say unto you,
<201 denieth this is a liar and a child of the <631

5:40 For I say unto you that <6255 is good cometh from God, and
<8 is evil <8 from the <25

5:41 <3836 if a man <253 <253 good <245 he hearkeneth unto
the <131 of the good <78 and he doth <5079 him; but <65
<22 <22 evil <3203 the same becometh a <67 of the devil, for
he <32 unto his voice, and doth <26 him.

5:42 And <30 <296 this must <388 his <3188 of him; <6048
for his <7 he <3198 <1452 as to <282 pertaining unto
<313 <1015 dead unto all good works.

5:43 And now, my <739 I <568 that ye <567 hear me, for I <1438
in the energy of my <8229 for <214 I have <475 unto you plainly
that ye <506 err, or have <11 <1278 to the <1123 of
God.

5:44 For I am <317 to <40 <312 this manner, <20 to the holy
<2068 of God, <261 is in <2413 Jesus; yea, I am <5718 to <991
and <959 unto this <730 the <98 <19 have been <51 by our
<12200 <5853 the <11 <11 are to come.

5:45 And this is not all. Do ye not <889 that I know of <1011 <23
myself? <255 I <44 unto you that I do know that <14 <14
whereof I have <49 are <1523 And how do ye <32 that I know of
<796 surety?

5:46 <35 I say unto you they are made <449 unto me by the Holy
<2457 of God. <18 I have <11896 and <5008 many days that I <2250
know <56 <56 of myself. And now I do know of <9643 that they are
true; for the Lord God hath made them <11612 unto me by his Holy
Spirit; and this is the <2214 of <2214 <129 is in me.

5:47 And <1911 I say unto you that it has thus been revealed unto
me, that the <1672 <26 have been <117 by our <165 are true, even
so <205 to the <44 of prophecy <18 is in me, <4 is also by
the manifestation of the <111 of God.

5:48 I say unto you, that I know of <100 that <397 I <660 say
unto you, <213 that <35 is to <11729 is <111 and I say unto
you, that I know that <2669 <256 <25 <16 yea, the Son, the Only
Begotten of the Father, full of grace, and mercy, and <3531 And
<324 it is he that <447 to take away the sins of the <652 yea,
the sins of <3434 man who steadfastly believeth on his name.

5:49 And now I say unto you that this is the <325 <334 <82 I am
<586 yea, to <2512 unto my beloved <397 yea, and <38 one
that dwelleth in the <4897 yea, to <17 unto all, both old and <6674
both bond and free; yea, I say unto you the aged, and also the middle
<6 and the rising generation; yea, to cry unto them that they must
<928 and be born again.

5:50 Yea, thus saith the Spirit: <888 all ye ends of the <7500 for
the <1086 of <1086 is soon at hand; yea, the Son of God <136 in
his glory, in his <4971 majesty, power, and dominion. Yea, my <102
<103 I say unto you, that the <229 <921 <1131 the <12249 of
the King of all the <12486 and also the King of <51 <204 very soon
shine <595 <1053 all the <1294 of men.

5:51 And also the <38 <87 unto me, yea, crieth unto me with a
<1854 <604 <2474 Go <29 and say unto this people—Repent, for
<1373 ye <122 ye can in <12153 <9169 the <105 of heaven.

5:52 And <1114 I say unto you, the <46 <84 <423 the ax is laid
at the root of the tree; <1944 <206 tree that <674 not <51
good <1017 <89 be hewn down and cast into the fire, yea, a fire <241
<600 be consumed, even an unquenchable fire. <43 and remember,
the Holy One hath <394 it.

5:53 And now my <155 <154 I say unto you, can ye <7950
<480 sayings; yea, can ye lay aside <7 <2551 and trample the Holy
One <3769 your feet; yea, can ye be <990 up in the <2777 of your
<2349 yea, will ye <961 persist in the <6870 of <3508 apparel and
setting your <3419 upon the vain <529 of the <360 upon your
riches?

5:54 Yea, will ye <30 in supposing that ye are <7223 one than
another; yea, will ye <14 in the <7321 of your <94 who
<3073 <2112 and do walk <371 the holy <375 of God, wherewith
they have been <1896 into this <2090 <1048 been sanctified by the
Holy Spirit, and they do <1153 <172 <868 <158 are meet for
repentance—

5:55 Yea, and will you <57 in <3282 your <3282 upon the <7250 and
the <3221 and in withholding your <3233 from <2234

5:56 And finally, all ye that will <29 in your <1929 I say
unto you that <168 are they who <227 be hewn down and cast into the
fire <284 they speedily repent.

5:57 And now I say unto you, all you that are <10757 to <916 the
<953 of the good <953 come ye out from the wicked, and be ye
separate, and touch not <748 unclean things; and <555 <5 <7540
<60 be <7542 out, that the <8 of the <6765 <10 not be
numbered <385 the <11 of the righteous, that the word of God may be
<4683 <147 <341 The <16 of the <27 <27 not be mingled
with the <11 of my <6970

5:58 For the <10 of the <2112 <21 be <10902 in the book of
<5701 and unto them will I <3151 an inheritance at my <10667 hand. And
now, my <237 what have ye to say <1885 <1131 I say unto you, if
ye <950 <10 it, it matters not, for the word of God must be
fulfilled.

5:59 For what <1260 is <1546 <107 you <255 many <1201 doth not
<6107 over <1464 that the wolves enter not and devour his flock? And
<148 if a wolf <12 his flock doth he not <4483 him out? Yea, and
at the last, if he can, he will <5108 him.

5:60 And now I say unto you that the good <64 doth call <332 you;
and if you will <1307 unto his <223 he will <319 you into his fold,
and ye are his sheep; and he commandeth you that ye suffer no <5542
wolf to <74 <101 you, that ye may not be <6247

5:61 And now I, <3043 do <9862 you in the <11425 of him who hath
<1082 me, that ye <10050 to do the <914 <229 I have <520 unto
you.

5:62 I <173 by way of <35 unto you that <2895 to the <3758 and
unto <3619 who do not <11 to the <2931 I <24 by way of
invitation, <645 Come and be <4204 unto <10451 that ye also
may be partakers of the <605 of the tree of <1823

Alma <3216 6

6:1 And now it came to pass that <154 Alma had made an end of speaking
unto the <1175 of the <486 <96 was <3187 in the city of
<3188 he ordained <7830 and elders, by laying on his <3061
<1018 to the <521 of God, to preside and <254 over the <7492

6:2 And it came to pass that <1337 did not <111 to the <111 who
<12984 of <412 sins were <107 unto <107 and were <2628
into the <34

6:3 And it also came to pass that <35 did <34 to the <34
that did not <775 of <36 <3572 and <599 <599 <2050
God—I mean <168 who were <4082 up in the <674 of <18 hearts—the
same were rejected, and <7 <417 were <471 out, that <6 <6
were not <467 <259 <29 of the righteous.

6:4 And thus they <3136 to <3136 the <120 of the <63 in the
city of <6299

6:5 Now I <1414 that ye <1414 understand that the word of God was
<7693 unto all, that none were deprived of the privilege of
assembling <90 <7213 to hear the word of God.

6:6 <6766 the <920 of God were <307 that they <43
gather <24 <24 oft, and join in fasting and <917 prayer
in behalf of the welfare of the <2603 of <100 who knew not God.

6:7 And now it came to pass that when Alma had made <667 regulations
he <6415 from <477 yea, from the <112 <259 was in the city of
<258 and went over upon the east of the <5757 <6118 into the
<6439 of <6731 <517 <515 been a city built, <30 was <1500 the
city of <14 <8 was in the <21 that was <13 <9 <1576
<4 <324 the man who was <5802 by the hand of <6752 with the <6266

6:8 And Alma went and <192 to <11466 the word of God unto the <82
<45 was <342 in the <46 of <44 <330 to the
<1391 of the <9984 of the word <19 had been <457 by his
<2577 and <20 to the <1368 of <1368 <15 was in him,
<11 to the <3645 of <1323 <2304 the Son of God, who <188
come to <2309 his <403 from <280 <12781 and the holy <263 by <32
he was called. And thus it is written. Amen.

Alma <451 7

7:1 <1177 my <1035 <704 <3765 that I have been permitted to
come unto you, <1096 I attempt to address you in my language; yea,
by my own mouth, <26 that it is the <3684 time that I have <105
unto you by the <572 of my <20 I <196 been <3757 <3760 to the
<9420 <8 had much <10634 that I <6270 not come unto you.

7:2 And even I <12 not have come now at this time were it not that
the <3802 hath been <8882 to <4294 to <3823 in my <9514 and
the Lord in much <2228 hath <9977 that I <149 come unto you.

7:3 And <762 I have come <67 <4181 hopes and much <10444 that I
<22 find that ye had <3187 <2527 <476 God, and that ye had
continued in the supplicating of his <1505 that I <23 find that ye
were <2549 <23 him, that I <11 find that ye were not in the
awful dilemma that our <3191 were in at <463

7:4 But <12936 be the name of God, that he hath <107 me to <13441 yea,
hath <7 unto me the <8270 <86 joy of knowing that they are
<306 <1323 in the way of his <10928

7:5 And I trust, <284 to the <1334 of God <263 is in me, that I
<975 also have joy over you; <2224 I do not <128 that my joy
over you <97 come by the <2278 of so much <4286 and <4696
<36 I have had for the <102 at <449 for <166 my joy
<1494 over them <415 <13518 <2647 much <4777 and sorrow.

7:6 But <19 I <3350 that ye are not in a <13613 of so much unbelief
as were your <7648 I <18 that ye are not <659 up in the <659
of your <1333 yea, I <16 that ye have not set your <1327 upon
<4747 and the vain <1330 of the world; yea, I <20 that you do not
worship idols, but that ye do <6 the true and <3415 God, and that
ye look <3345 for the <4451 of your <419 with an <3681
<3351 <120 is to <1992

7:7 For <100 I say unto you <558 be many <58 to <2646 and
<13 <9 is one thing <27 is of more importance than they
all—for <14 the time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth
and <155 <750 his <4322

7:8 <1505 I do not say that he will come <16 us at the time of his
dwelling in his <3394 tabernacle; for <44 the <241 hath not said
unto me that this <223 be the case. Now as to this <73 I do not
know; but this much I do <304 that the Lord God hath <3955 to do all
<104 <95 are <286 to his <12893

7:9 But <53 the <53 hath said this much unto me, <1023 Cry
unto this <4195 saying—Repent ye, and <2796 the way of the <3450
and walk in his paths, <41 are straight; for <34 the <1676 of
<1731 is at <2812 and the Son of God <132 upon the face of the
<6645

7:10 And <27 he <345 be born of Mary, at Jerusalem <40 is the
land of our forefathers, she <733 a virgin, a <5137 and chosen
vessel, who <26 be overshadowed and conceive by the <113 of the Holy
Ghost, and <1219 <1538 a son, yea, even the Son of God.

7:11 And he <30 go <14633 <4745 pains and <382 and
temptations of <1741 <7816 and this that the word <2174 be fulfilled
<71 <1813 he will take upon him the <26 and the sicknesses of his
<237

7:12 And he will take upon him <2405 that he may loose the <3865 of
<3950 <36 bind his <1448 and he will take upon him <746
infirmities, that his bowels may be <3531 with <2076 <207 to the
flesh, that he may know <9 to the flesh how to succor his <776
<10 to <32 infirmities.

7:13 Now the <225 <2995 all <1551 <507 the Son of God
suffereth <21 to the <31 that he <107 take upon him the sins
of his <239 that he <12 blot out <40 transgressions <23 to
the <169 of his deliverance; and now <210 this is the <851
<100 is in me.

7:14 Now I say unto you that ye must <2970 and be born <14140 for the
<74 <160 if ye are not born <617 ye <1898 <1953 the <277 of
<3304 <833 come and be <1224 unto <1224 that ye may be
<3529 from your <471 that ye may have <3840 on the Lamb of God, who
taketh away the sins of the <1852 who is <1098 to save and to cleanse
from all unrighteousness.

7:15 Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay <1927 <250 sin,
<106 easily doth beset you, <5 doth bind you down to destruction,
yea, come and go <279 and show unto your God that ye are <12590 to
<1284 of your sins and <1510 into a covenant with him to keep his
<10689 and <14470 it unto him this day by <15035 into the <3040
of baptism.

7:16 And <1330 <2702 <13898 and <11791 the <2634 of God from
thenceforth, the same will <11983 that I say unto him, yea, he will
<10 that I have said unto him, he <362 have <3301 <1733
<225 to the <214 of the Holy <1932 <106 testifieth in me.

7:17 And now my <1034 <1034 do you <4145 <1222 things? <588
I say unto you, yea, I know that ye <14 <6124 and the way that I
know that ye <11 them is by the <2481 of the <241 <49
is in me. And now <5133 your <215 is <11024 <2470 <4567 yea,
<4 the <573 <19 I have spoken, <884 is my joy.

7:18 For as I said unto you from the <3584 that I had much <859
that ye were not in the <810 of <949 like your <94 even so I
have <3359 that my <11184 have been gratified.

7:19 For I perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness; I
<11 that ye are in the path <75 leads to the <328 of God;
yea, I <17 that ye are <10802 his <28 straight.

7:20 I <13 that it has been made <2723 unto you, by the <182
of his <4893 that he <368 walk in crooked paths; <9394 doth he vary
from that <53 he hath said; <11 hath he a shadow of <2116 from
the <1942 to the left, or from that <21 is <9 to that <5 is
wrong; <2965 his <7942 is one <242 round.

7:21 And he doth not dwell in unholy temples; <45 can filthiness or
<11886 <29 is <2069 be <1647 into the <111 of God;
<439 I say unto you the time <282 <2658 yea, and it <5 be at
the last day, that he who is filthy <12 <12235 in his filthiness.

7:22 And now my <287 <193 I have said <287 <237 unto you
that I <548 awaken you to a sense of your duty to God, that ye may
walk <1187 <1187 him, that ye may walk <1063 the holy <1384 of
God, <7 <90 ye have been received.

7:23 And now I <1648 that ye <892 be humble, and be submissive and
gentle; easy to be entreated; full of <9660 and long-suffering;
<790 temperate in all <643 <5 diligent in <3795 the
<426 of God at all times; asking for <2810 <91 ye <3036
in need, both spiritual and temporal; <12580 returning thanks unto God
for <18 <18 ye do receive.

7:24 And see that ye have <1054 hope, and charity, and then ye will
<30 abound in good <3158

7:25 And may the Lord <6774 you, and keep your <3836 <3983 that
ye may at last be <2406 to sit down with <4016 <4015 and <4013
and the holy prophets who have been ever since the world began, <1383
your <34 spotless even as <726 <5 are <40 in the
<240 of <955 to go no more out.

7:26 And now my <215 <215 I have <1502 <215 <1498 unto you
<531 to the <478 <186 <527 in me; and my soul doth
<1349 rejoice, <482 of the <6119 diligence and heed <18
ye have <1366 unto my <1052

7:27 And now, may the <6178 of God rest upon you, and upon your houses
and <7591 and upon your <6139 and <6139 and all that you possess,
your <7587 and your <8254 <68 to your <536 and good <3370
from this time <992 and <14055 And thus I have spoken. <1646

Alma <1646 8

8:1 And now it came to pass that Alma <6690 from the land of <1739
<296 <153 <10375 the <919 of <8253 many <231 <100 <462 be
<13285 <13 <1455 the <317 of the <2111 <66 as he
had <335 done in the land of <1407 yea, he <42 to his own
house at Zarahemla to rest <5411 from the <9938 <40 he had
performed.

8:2 And thus <6011 the <5452 year of the <1629 of the <5451 over the
<69 of <14133

8:3 And it came to pass in the <5480 of the tenth year of the
<29 of the <29 over the <28 of <5480 that Alma <1944 from
<5411 and took his <14068 over into the land of Melek, on the west of
the <1941 <1941 on the west by the <5339 of the wilderness.

8:4 And he <1902 to <11000 the <46 in the land of Melek <132 to
the holy <141 of God, by <113 he had been called; and he <26 to
<27 the <27 <5255 all the land of Melek.

8:5 And it came to pass that the <18 came to him <21 all the
<67 of the land <42 was by the <7961 side. And they were
<1023 <19 all the <3158

8:6 So that when he had <7892 his work at <80 he <128 thence,
and <14747 <6532 days’ <128 on the north of the land of Melek; and
he came to a city <53 was <2041 Ammonihah.

8:7 Now it was the custom of the <80 of <7213 to call <422 <341
and <4 cities, and <3 villages, yea, even all <5 <12404
<7 <293 the name of him who <1925 possessed <907 and thus it
was with the land of <51

8:8 And it came to pass that when Alma had come to the city of
Ammonihah he <164 to <3272 the word of God unto <5283

8:9 Now Satan had gotten <914 hold upon the <1665 of the <85 of
the city of Ammonihah; <738 they <649 not <2620 unto the <488
of <6691

8:10 <2273 Alma <12197 much in the spirit, wrestling with God
in <1167 prayer, that he <29 pour out his <509 upon the <45 who
were in the <8704 that he <16 also <2786 that he <742 <5605 them
unto repentance.

8:11 <8619 they hardened <140 <5141 <4987 unto him: <1052
we know that thou art <13925 and we know that thou art high <5693 over
the <2203 <197 thou hast <442 in many parts of the <5555
<312 to your tradition; and we are not of thy <455 and we do
not <1077 in such foolish traditions.

8:12 And now we know that <593 we are not of thy <48 we know that
thou hast no <1374 over us; and thou hast <5307 up the
<2089 unto Nephihah; <158 thou art not the <6076 <6067
over us.

8:13 Now when the <137 had said <1222 and <11217 all his <10708
and reviled him, and spit upon him, and <9109 that he <840 be cast
out of <137 <8811 he <335 <461 and took his <333 <4353 the
city <125 was <322 Aaron.

8:14 And it came to pass that <6377 he was journeying thither, <854
weighed down with sorrow, <1969 <1969 much tribulation and <14715
of soul, <118 of the <2615 of the <80 who were in the city
of Ammonihah, it came to pass <39 Alma was thus <36 down with
<37 <8202 an <15280 of the Lord <15282 unto him, <1771

8:15 Blessed art thou, <217 <1069 lift up thy head and <764
for thou hast <320 <2062 to <11566 for thou hast been <5368 in
<934 the <933 of God from the time <110 thou receivedst thy
<395 message from him. <264 I am he that <188 it unto you.

8:16 And <1571 I am sent to <2887 thee that thou <7862 to the city
of <100 and <394 <1552 unto the <114 of the <328 yea, <9
unto <400 Yea, say unto <2581 <3241 they <1466 the Lord God will
<3031 <14

8:17 For <49 they do study at this time that they may <17 the
<12389 of thy <1654 (for thus <1608 the Lord) <94 is <11153 to
the statutes, and <12912 and <110 <11 he has <884 unto
his <1775

8:18 Now it came to pass that <519 Alma had <1196 his <122 from
the <178 of the Lord he <791 <3320 to the land of <521
And he entered the city by <7654 way, yea, by the way <52 is on the
south of the city of <24

8:19 And as he <28 the city he was an hungered, and he said to a
man: Will ye give to an <2880 servant of God something to eat?

8:20 And the man said unto him: I am a Nephite, and I know that thou
art a holy prophet of God, for thou art the man whom an <102 said in a
vision: Thou shalt <1151 <4370 go with me into my <898 and I
will <10749 unto thee of my food; and I know that thou wilt be a
blessing unto me and my house.

8:21 And it came to pass that the man <161 him into his house; and
the man was <405 Amulek; and he <1164 <1025 <4727 and meat and set
<972 <625

8:22 And it came to pass that Alma ate <20 and was filled; and he
<2488 Amulek and his house, and he gave <1256 unto God.

8:23 And <223 he had eaten and was <1976 he said unto Amulek: I am
<3256 and am the high <605 over the <556 of God <845 the
<6360

8:24 And <308 I have been <87 to <337 the word of God <2277 all
this <307 <620 to the <2805 of <2826 and <6828 and I
was in this land and they <691 not <4484 me, but they cast me out
and I was <6076 to set my back <545 this land <1155

8:25 But <60 I have been <3021 that I <576 turn <408 and
prophesy unto this <60 yea, and to <4376 <3495 them <1722
<587 iniquities.

8:26 And now, Amulek, <549 thou hast fed me and <11353 me in, thou
art blessed; for I was an <309 for I had <4357 many days.

8:27 And Alma tarried many days with <176 <199 he <866 to <126
unto the <404

8:28 And it came to pass that the <484 did wax more gross in <70
<71

8:29 And the word came to <186 <586 Go; and also say unto my
<360 <84 go <256 and <108 unto this <108 <2368
ye, for thus <478 the <2367 <515 ye <515 I will <13451 this <51
in mine anger; yea, and I will not turn my fierce <10322 away.

8:30 And Alma went <2020 and also <48 <214 the <44 to <3055
the <930 of God unto <1004 and they were <268 with the Holy Ghost.

8:31 And they had <812 <525 unto <579 <9366 that they <2912 not
be <2939 in dungeons; <1726 was it <10553 that any man <14
slay <40 <2245 they did not <5984 <128 <31 <5674 they
were bound in <2316 and cast into prison. Now, this was done that the
Lord <956 show <127 his <24 in <623

8:32 And it came to pass that they went <17 and <194 to <194 and
to <150 unto the <106 <318 to the <318 and <32 <563
the Lord had <92 <37

Alma <1441 9

9:1 And <8408 I, <194 <1416 been <299 of God that I <301 take
<244 and go <52 and <50 <308 unto this <47 or the <184
who were in the city of <733 it came to pass as I <74 to <24
unto <148 they <7 to <9396 with me, <243

9:2 Who art thou? Suppose ye that we <1841 <1011 the <1953 of one
man, although he <64 <33 unto us that the <16803 <7 pass away?

9:3 Now they <17181 not the <219 <112 they spake; for they knew
not that the <24 <24 pass <252

9:4 And they said also: We will not <54 thy <28 if thou shouldst
<154 that this <886 city <26 be <7994 in one day.

9:5 Now they knew not that God <232 do such <16399 <1617 for they
were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked <383

9:6 And they <17190 Who is God, that <5392 no more <6837 than one
man <314 this <161 to <314 unto them the <3349 of such <63 and
<45 <2242

9:7 And they <7406 <188 to lay <283 <3707 on me; but <510 they did
not. And I <16 with boldness to <38 unto <180 yea, I did boldly
<510 unto <8 <182

9:8 <968 O ye <4078 and perverse <15411 how have ye forgotten
the <8888 of your <15937 yea, how soon ye have <12 the
<898 of God.

9:9 Do ye not <2358 that our <6955 Lehi, was <717 out of
<2772 by the hand of God? Do ye not <19 that they were all led
by him <1124 the wilderness?

9:10 And have ye <51 so soon how many times he <1043 our
<4843 out of the <118 of <121 <9920 and <15479 them from
<1164 <9370 even by the <14 of <14 own brethren?

9:11 Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless <4640 and his
<2723 and his <6825 <674 us, we <239 <14384 have
been cut off from the face of the <278 long <614 this period of
<5847 and <16069 been consigned to a <2358 of <15982 misery and woe.

9:12 <167 now I say unto you that he <4074 you to repent; and
<586 ye <2686 ye can in <4626 <2673 the <1994 of God. But
<222 this is not all—he has <435 you to <21 or he will
utterly <1105 you from off the face of the <4712 yea, he will <622
you in his anger, and in his <617 <617 he will not turn <369

9:13 <75 do ye not <192 the <366 <394 he <7202 unto <214
<1490 that: Inasmuch as ye <435 keep my <2632 ye <5
<11498 in the land? And <492 it is said <20 <20 as ye will not
keep my <260 ye <22 be cut off from the presence of the <14252

9:14 Now I <867 that ye <175 <4682 that <11447 as the
<7108 have not kept the <33 of God, they have been cut off
from the <36 of the <36 Now we see that the word of the Lord has
been verified in this thing, and the <38 have been cut off from
his presence, from the beginning of <261 <2901 in the <971

9:15 <1660 I say unto you, that it <93 be more tolerable for
them in the day of <16752 than for you, if ye <2412 in your <2864
yea, and even more <23 for them in this life than for you, <234
ye <4576

9:16 For <3330 are many <9038 <179 are <5875 to the <8842
for it is <942 of the <9421 of <79 <361 that <1555 them
to <53 in <9 <296 of ignorance; <1600 the Lord will be
merciful unto them and prolong <15 existence in the <103

9:17 And at some <332 of time they will be <444 to <607 in his
<2612 and to know of the incorrectness of the <59 of <35
<488 and many of them will be saved, for the Lord will be <55
unto all who call on his <5169

9:18 But <336 I say unto you that if ye <4724 in your <1592
that your days <167 not be prolonged in the <1756 for the <205
<11 be sent upon you; and if ye <969 not they <11 come in a time
when you know not, and ye <12 be <14423 with utter destruction; and
it <9 be <855 to the <364 <364 of the <267

9:19 For he will not <4503 you that ye <22 live in your <16381
to <409 his <699 I say unto you, Nay; he <325 <10255 <22 that
the <78 <929 <17 all his <853 who are <1235 the <5 of
<2210 if it were <979 that they <746 fall into sins and
transgressions, <1292 <898 had so much <7303 and so much <16606
<924 unto them of the Lord <176 God;

9:20 Yea, <24 <24 been such a highly favored <48 of the <14432
yea, <13 <13 been <10 <10726 <3119 <13956 nation, kindred,
tongue, or <3326 <13 <13 had all <2373 made <2847 unto <725
<129 to <45 desires, and <3 <2603 and prayers, of that <304
has been, and <5 is, and <3 is to <3653

9:21 Having been <167 by the <2020 of God; <44 conversed with
angels, and <6 been <2549 unto by the <4683 of the <76 and
<12 the <1036 of prophecy, and the <5 of revelation, and also
many gifts, the gift of <4556 with tongues, and the gift of
preaching, and the gift of the Holy <3502 and the gift of translation;

9:22 Yea, and <108 <46 been <742 of God out of the land of
<9711 by the hand of the <66 <18 been <6841 from famine, and
from sickness, and all <6731 of diseases of <150 <3519 and they
<20 waxed <3102 in battle, that they <230 not be <14933 <11
been <387 out of <7647 time <58 <728 and <11 been kept and
<793 <1199 now; and they have been prospered <7 they are rich
in all <51 of things—

9:23 And now <1934 I say unto you, that if this <973 who have
<1611 so many blessings from the hand of the <1336 <625 <12072
<1815 to the <271 and <269 <200 they do have, I say unto you
that if this be the <17528 that if they <27 fall into transgression,
it <336 be far more <562 for the <337 than for <1225

9:24 For <449 the <555 of the Lord are <557 to the
<9376 but they are not unto you if ye transgress; for has not the
Lord <14424 promised and firmly decreed, that if ye will <15077
<1535 him that ye <410 <814 be <1131 from off the face of the
<7227

9:25 And now for this cause, that ye may not be <951 the Lord has
sent his <1798 to <835 many of his <144 <13695 unto them that
they must go <1105 and cry <10918 unto this <15 <1082 Repent
ye, for the <893 of <2887 is nigh at <5624

9:26 And not many days hence the Son of God <81 come in his glory;
and his <5613 <9 be the <4 of the Only <5802 of the <5802
full of <4298 equity, and <17215 full of patience, <1009 and
long-suffering, quick to hear the cries of his <452 and to <14487
<423 prayers.

9:27 And <176 he <3906 to <4519 <4689 who will be <2617 unto
<3641 <1106 <2878 on his <648

9:28 <1912 <3957 ye the way of the <255 for the time is at hand
that all men <84 reap a reward of <52 <1290 <482 to that
<267 they have been—if they have been <5268 they <20 reap the
<17073 of <21 souls, <21 to the <1485 and <8593 of
<4602 <6465 and if they have been evil they <25 reap the damnation
of <25 <25 <25 to the <25 and captivation of the <6366

9:29 Now <107 this is the <499 of the angel, crying unto the
<654

9:30 And now, my <3072 <3072 for ye are my <5 and ye <13898
to be beloved, and ye <7 to <3994 <232 <5532 <97 are meet for
<141 <4607 that your <2625 have been grossly <2555 <300
the word of God, and <15 that ye are a lost and a <17962 <59

9:31 Now it came to pass that when I, <1584 had <585 <3134 <2470
<90 the <211 were <13686 with me <922 I said unto them that
they were a <1452 and a <1452 <40

9:32 And also <21 I said unto them that they were a lost and a
<61 <40 they were <16221 with me, and <10455 to lay <158 <1305
upon me, that they <547 cast me into <1719

9:33 But it came to pass that the Lord did not <801 them that they
<478 take me at that time and cast me into <30

9:34 And it came to pass that <1683 went and <1480 <1837 and <1655 to
<1630 unto them <8212 And now the <1225 of <18 are not all <3132
<1801 a part of his <13 are <5539 in this book.

interpreted the writing <52 was upon the wall of the temple, <8

<217 of his <12088

10:4 And <279 I am also a man of no <3016 reputation <1700 all <483
who know me; yea, and <19 I have many kindreds and friends, and I
have also acquired much <4639 by the hand of my industry.

10:5 <2916 <800 all <2803 I never have <966 much of the ways
of the <506 and his mysteries and <1740 power. I said I <20 had
<21 much of <204 <3631 but <59 I mistake, for I have seen much
of his <27 and his <28 power; yea, even in the preservation
of the lives of this <363

10:6 <66 I did harden my <7490 for I was <1109 many <1675
and I <793 not hear; <1304 I knew <2278 <57 <6107 yet I
<12 not <4596 <12 I went on <19169 <459 God, in the
<1240 of my <38 even <894 the fourth day of this <9730
month, <229 is in the <3376 year of the <3375 of the <9998

10:7 As I was <2885 to see a very near <1115 <913 an <769 of
the Lord <2848 unto me and <1904 <2207 <2780 to thine own <2482
for thou <2579 feed a <2599 of the <1012 yea, a holy man, who is a
<4569 man of God; for he has <2348 many days <487 of the sins of
this <799 and he is an <2367 and thou <40 <2446 him into thy
<2617 and feed him, and he <654 <3750 thee and thy <2586 and the
<2612 of the Lord <13 rest upon thee and thy <2617

10:8 And it came to pass that I obeyed the <661 of the <661 and
<2774 <1807 my <23 And as I was <4302 thither I <4135 the man
whom the <127 said unto me: Thou <73 <73 into thy house—and
<140 it was this same man who has been <1179 unto you <211
the <1262 of God.

10:9 And the <35 said unto me he is a holy man; wherefore I know he
is a holy man <136 it was said by an <24 of God.

10:10 And <2257 I know that the <46 <6907 he hath <14619 are
<6734 for <70 I say unto you, that as the Lord liveth, even so has
he sent his <39 to make <288 <30 <6861 unto me; and this he
has done <3097 this Alma hath dwelt at my <133

10:11 For <366 he hath <2726 mine <242 he hath <5 me, and
my <18739 and my <3804 and my <8529 and my kinsfolk; yea, even all
my kindred hath he <8318 and the <206 of the Lord hath rested
upon us <870 to the <616 <327 he spake.

10:12 And now, when <625 had <786 <84 <15 the <627 <677 to
be <12199 <820 <1722 was more than one <4518 who <126 of
the <104 <134 they were accused, and also of the <9 <44 were
to <4203 <53 to the <1394 of <5558 <11 was in <1207

10:13 <444 <41 were some <548 them who thought to question
<1478 that by <795 <13222 devices they <792 catch them in <8
<859 that they <9 find <64 <439 <20 that they <7
<8998 them to <17 <3794 that they <9 be <8489 <60 to the
law, and that they <11 be <5684 or cast into prison, <15 to the
<16647 <74 they <1600 make appear or <43 <43 <79

10:14 Now it was <624 men who <869 to <1637 <57 who were
lawyers, who were hired or <9499 by the <147 to administer the
law at <68 <541 of trials, or at the <15866 of the <9537 of the
<21 <2163 the <503

10:15 Now <180 lawyers were learned in all the arts and <124 of the
<1619 and this was to enable them that they <98 be skilful in <49
profession.

10:16 And it came to pass that they <216 to <163 <525 that
<11360 they <26 make him <11955 his <159 or contradict the <236
<123 he <941 speak.

10:17 Now they knew not that <255 <135 know of <50 designs. But it
came to pass as they <46 to <46 him, he perceived <16
thoughts, and he said unto them: O ye <2415 and <2415 <2415
ye <107 and hypocrites, for ye are <6171 the foundation of the
devil; for ye are <10 traps and snares to <240 the holy ones of
God.

10:18 Ye are <18 <12608 to <16494 the ways of the <6557 and to
<1169 down the wrath of God upon your heads, even to the <1897
<9096 of this <750

10:19 Yea, well did <15261 say, who was our last <15869 when he was
<3057 to <286 up the <17208 <1632 no one to <17515 it <18099
causing that this <216 <147 be governed by <120 own voices—yea,
well did he say that if the time <16 come that the <616 of this
<25 <9 <16425 <16424 that is, if the time <8 come that
this <14 <6 fall into <1605 they <799 be ripe for
<11547

10:20 And now I say unto you that well doth the Lord <3727 of your
iniquities; well doth he cry unto this <725 by the <59 of his
angels: <1530 ye, <2406 for the <1530 of <1530 is at <6651

10:21 Yea, well doth he cry, by the <27 of his angels <2358 I will
come down <450 my <42 with equity and justice in my hands.

10:22 Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the <19737 of
the <205 who are now in the <2124 that ye <112 even now be
<1935 with <205 <2102 yet it <11 not be by flood, as were
the <138 in the days of <9527 but it <17 be by <1869 and by
pestilence, and the <6152

10:23 But it is by the <61 of the <1517 that ye are spared; now
<3745 if ye will cast out the <14 from <107 you then will
not the Lord stay his <1668 but in his <2166 <2166 he will come out
<509 you; then ye <864 be <19031 by <65 and by <64 and
by the <12970 and the time is soon at hand <2377 ye <2376

10:24 And now it came to pass that the <107 were more <1412 with
<454 and they <17040 out, <1297 This man doth revile <55 our
laws <452 are <17395 and our wise <409 whom we have selected.

10:25 But <455 stretched <1543 his <5601 and <33 the mightier unto
<580 <37 O ye <440 and <440 <440 why hath <4183 got
such <2915 hold upon your <9179 Why will ye yield <6063 unto him
that he may have <1633 over you, to blind your <10620 that ye will not
<6490 the <526 <73 are <5133 <656 to <377 truth?

10:26 For <836 have I <762 <93 your law? Ye do not
understand; ye say that I have <794 <14 your law; but I have not,
but I have <12 in <13652 of your law, to your <11465

10:27 And now <44 I say unto you, that the <531 of the
<483 of this <163 is <2610 to be laid by the
unrighteousness of your <149 and your <675

10:28 And now it came to pass that when <155 had <59 <685 <103
the <35 <157 out <78 him, <155 Now we know that this man is
a <8090 of the <8090 for he hath lied unto us; for he hath <33
<27 our law. And now he says that he has not <13 <12 it.

10:29 And <1036 he has <4173 <11 our <782 and our <78

10:30 And it came to pass that the <93 put it into <174 <1767
that they <521 <2839 <85 <921 <30 him.

10:31 And <908 was one <351 them <8938 name was Zeezrom. Now he was
the foremost to accuse <114 and <1767 he <3020 one of the most expert
<25 <270 <613 much <6392 to do <7 the <645

10:32 Now the object of <55 <67 was to get gain; and they got
gain <249 to <75 employ.

Alma <1664 11

11:1 Now it was in the law of <678 that <2322 man who was a <591 of
the law, or <918 who were <906 to be <10860 <109 <1237 <8232
<45 to the time <301 they <4488 to <25 <20 who were
<2338 <903 them to be judged.

11:2 Now if a man owed <6456 and he <520 not pay that <31 he did
owe, he was complained of to the <10456 and the <41 <14237
authority, and sent <407 officers that the man <64 be <49
<50 him; and he <1034 the man <71 to the law and the
evidences <44 were <19 <191 him, and thus the man was
compelled to pay that <15 he owed, or be stripped, or be cast out
from <173 the <300 as a thief and a robber.

11:3 And the <72 <2398 for his <127 <55 to his time—a
senine of gold for a day, or a senum of <11193 <48 is <16697 to a
<17 of gold; and this is <28 to the law <16 was given.

11:4 Now <222 are the <7000 of the different pieces of <218 <14727 and
of <5 <40 <28 to <4 value. And the <19 are <2715 by
the <12244 for they did not reckon <1720 the <2499 of the Jews who
were at Jerusalem; <3739 did they <18874 <15 the <15 of the
Jews; but they altered <41 reckoning and <3 measure, <48 to
the minds and the circumstances of the <795 in <264 <579
<1655 the <1640 of the <255 they <324 been <4660 by king
<19637

11:5 Now the <39 is thus—a <120 of <94 a seon of <4 a shum
of <5 and a limnah of gold.

11:6 A <151 of <111 an amnor of <4 an ezrom of <4 and an
onti of silver.

11:7 A <22 of silver was <172 to a <51 of <42 and either for a
<113 of barley, and also for a <7 of <94 kind of grain.

11:8 Now the amount of a seon of gold was twice the value of a senine.

11:9 And a shum of gold was <16 the <16 of a seon.

11:10 And a <99 of gold was the <15 of them all.

11:11 And an <102 of <84 was as <730 as two senums.

11:12 And an <113 of <15 was as <15 as four <15

11:13 And an onti was as <13 as them all.

11:14 Now this is the <55 of the <17565 numbers of <219 reckoning—

11:15 A shiblon is half of a senum; <919 a <8 for half a
<133 of barley.

11:16 And a shiblum is a half of a shiblon.

11:17 And a leah is the half of a shiblum.

11:18 Now this is <56 number, <275 to <4 reckoning.

11:19 Now an antion of gold is <203 to <5145 shiblons.

11:20 Now, it was for the sole <19132 to get <16968 <1730 they
<418 <34 <417 <38 to <4 employ, <87 they did
stir up the <446 to riotings, and all <342 of disturbances and
<7943 that they <1400 have more <24 that they <6 get <15568
<34 to the suits <423 were <502 <520 <4103 <2011 they
did stir up the <39 <512 Alma and Amulek.

11:21 And this Zeezrom <1400 to <1400 <992 <796 Will ye <2662
me a few questions <37 I <1045 ask you? Now <20 was a man who was
<707 in the <1629 of the <811 that he <67 <1565 that <25
was <19899 <100 he said unto <4469 Will ye <42 the <39
<15 I <40 put unto you?

11:22 And <754 said unto him: Yea, if it be <100 to the <3124
of the <2190 <27 is in me; for I <31 say <20863 <9 is <2959
to the <20 of the <3301 And <81 said unto him: <3664 here are
six onties of <416 and all <553 will I give thee if thou wilt deny
the <3459 of a Supreme Being.

11:23 Now <71 <2105 O thou <921 of <10559 why tempt ye me? Knowest
thou that the <1208 yieldeth to no such temptations?

11:24 Believest thou that <871 is no God? I say unto you, Nay, thou
knowest that <13 is a God, but thou lovest that <17218 more than him.

11:25 And now thou hast lied <219 God unto me. Thou saidst unto
me—Behold <93 six onties, <121 are of <389 worth, I will give unto
thee—when thou hadst it in thy <10103 to retain them from me; and it was
only thy <6249 that I <786 deny the true and <6996 God, that thou
<21277 have <5050 to <219 me. And now <1105 for this <49 evil
thou <2112 have thy reward.

11:26 And <175 said unto him: Thou sayest <104 is a true and <40
God?

11:27 And <159 <159 Yea, <16 is a true and <16 God.

11:28 Now <34 <15 Is <15 more than one God?

11:29 And he <21192 No.

11:30 Now <21 said unto him <12804 How <161 thou <131 <4184

11:31 And he <36 An <2101 hath made them <2450 unto me.

11:32 And <30 said <28 Who is he that <281 come? Is it the Son
of God?

11:33 And he said unto him, Yea.

11:34 And <31 said <31 Shall he save his <410 in <460 <9865
And <110 <17880 and said unto him: I say unto you he <48 not, for
it is impossible for him to deny his <5979

11:35 Now <42 said unto the people: See that ye <1158 <104
<2538 for he said <136 is but one God; yet he <4665 that the Son of
God <47 <2094 but he <4 not save his people—as <21228 he had
<4340 to <5228 God.

11:36 Now <80 <30 <4016 unto him: <7618 thou hast lied, for thou
<216 that I <4050 as <30 I had <29 to <29 God <576 I
said he <47 not save his <119 in <119 <10277

11:37 And I say unto you <44 that he <5991 save them in <18 <11725
for I <9 deny his <3856 and he hath said that no <6403 <7185 can
<4170 the <1747 of <6842 <519 how can ye be <3857 <1577
ye <14 the <14 of heaven? <3199 ye <35 be <3541 in your
<63

11:38 Now <156 <105 <61 unto him: Is the Son of God the very
Eternal Father?

11:39 And <125 said unto him: Yea, he is the very <16 Father of
<1809 and of <8972 and all <1343 <419 in them are; he is the
<1467 and the end, the <5416 and the last;

11:40 And he <139 come into the <6278 to <3300 his <2133 and he
<12 take upon him the <4106 of <1267 who <3988 on his
name; and <237 are they that <19 have <6558 <6800 and <3270
<3334 to none else.

11:41 <15101 the <1644 <4053 as <202 <256 had been no
<10807 made, <144 it be the loosing of the <4827 of death; for
<464 the day <36 that all <46 rise from the dead and <6442
<539 God, and be <1278 <670 to <207 <6410

11:42 Now, <47 is a <7176 <126 is <2808 a temporal <40 and the
<10 of <9260 <38 <7195 the <52 of this <14 <7205 that all
<11 be <10850 from this <10 <11941

11:43 The <2417 and the body <16 be reunited <206 in its <10719
form; both limb and joint <13 be restored to its proper frame, even
as we now are at this time; and we <18 be <849 to <94 <93
God, <7746 even as we know now, and have a bright recollection of all
our guilt.

11:44 Now, this restoration <31 come to all, both old and <9262 both
bond and <15937 both male and <15937 both the <175 and the righteous;
and even <131 <27 not so much as a hair of <147 <13858 be lost; but
<1166 <345 <16 be <92 to its <104 <92 as it is now, or in
the body, and <17 be <91 and be arraigned <92 the bar of
<161 the Son, and God the <3613 and the Holy <7042 <183 is one
<324 God, to be <205 <205 to <58 <3550 <13003 they be
good or <6 they be evil.

11:45 Now, <243 I have <1725 unto you <2800 the <210 of the
<7632 <65 and also <10 the <12162 of the <9 body. I
say unto you that this <9 body is <219 to an immortal <24 that
is from <234 even from the <370 <39 unto <329 that they can die
no more; <74 spirits uniting with <4 <15635 <3130 to be divided;
thus the whole <21456 <6740 and immortal, that they can no more
see corruption.

11:46 Now, when <446 had <6297 <379 <1859 the <544 <1062 <266
to be <2725 and also <481 <9 to <20689 And thus <6484 the
<20 of <1078 or this is all that I have <8230

Alma <1736 12

12:1 Now <1789 <2759 that the <26 of <52 had silenced Zeezrom,
for he <12666 that <9 had caught him in his lying and deceiving to
<872 him, and <28 that he <62 to <21894 <9273 a consciousness
of his <11064 he <21706 his <11403 and <15 to <8768 unto him, and to
<8573 the <53 of <79 and to explain <536 beyond, or to
unfold the <21091 <14482 that <236 <59 had done.

12:2 Now the <26 that Alma <688 unto <119 were <21273 by the
<134 <21295 about; for the <21848 was great, and he <18 on this
wise:

12:3 Now <105 <86 that thou hast been <5521 in thy <102 and
craftiness, for thou hast not lied unto men only but thou hast lied
unto God; for <278 he knows all thy <2641 and thou seest that
thy <20887 are made <907 unto us by his <9866

12:4 And thou <19 that we know that thy plan was a very subtle plan,
as to the subtlety of the <1258 for to lie and to deceive this <103
that thou <1051 set them <1316 us, to <2288 us and to cast us
out—

12:5 Now this was a plan of <3291 adversary, and he hath <14893 his
<2251 in thee. Now I <1913 that ye <1101 <902 that what I say unto
thee I say unto all.

12:6 And <3130 I say unto you all that this was a snare of the
<47 <201 he has laid to <2737 this <1747 that he <1350 <2718
you into subjection unto him, that he <10 encircle you <2694 with his
chains, that he <10 chain you down to <8144 <7615
<466 to the <82 of his captivity.

12:7 Now when Alma had <459 <371 <2863 <242 <284 to <299
more <18411 for he was <18629 more and more of the <31 of
God; and he was also <14 that Alma and <284 had a <4325 of
him, for he was <14 that they knew the <218 and intents of
his heart; for <35 was <1899 unto them that they <84 know of <63
<330 <82 to the <708 of <12307

12:8 And <75 <75 to inquire of them diligently, that he <26
know more <537 the <949 of God. And he said unto Alma: What
does this mean <159 <76 hath <109 <19 the <556 of
the <12718 that all <631 rise from the <7 both the just and the
unjust, and are <643 to <734 <642 God to be <622 <74 to
<545 works?

12:9 And now Alma <74 to expound <92 <91 unto him, <1584 It is
<108 unto many to know the <3679 of God; <3922 they are
laid <470 a <17194 <1103 that they <65 not <6139 only <47
to the portion of his word <90 he doth <6682 unto the <8990 of
men, <18 to the heed and <7201 <16 they give unto him.

12:10 And <1089 he that will <3711 his <3673 the same <10496
the <1823 <43 of the <12100 and he that will not <18 his <18
to him is <87 the greater <19 of the <1140 <2046 it is <10 unto
him to know the <98 of God <13 he know them in full.

12:11 And they that will <41 <142 <6753 to them is <30 the
<60 <41 of the word <28 they know <1642 <193 his
mysteries; and then they are <518 captive by the <453 and led by his
will down to <2981 Now this is what is meant by the <12044 of
hell.

12:12 And <235 hath <235 <10563 <43 <767 and <2463 <779
from this mortality to a <5134 of <11861 and <12 <229 <227
the bar of God, to be <231 <166 to our <1058

12:13 Then if our <2533 have been <17272 yea, if we have <4304
our <11 <518 the <140 <5969 that it has not been <3689 in us,
then will our <54 be awful, for then we <233 be condemned.

12:14 For our <670 will condemn us, yea, all our <4360 will <7
us; we <22 not be <38 spotless; and our <400 will also <14
us; and in this <8834 <45 we <19 not dare to look up to our God;
and we <559 fain be glad if we <3317 <296 the rocks and the
mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his presence.

12:15 But this <1351 be; we must come <2483 and <372 <145 him in
his <10268 and in his <5627 and in his <10273 <10273 and dominion,
and acknowledge to our <548 shame that all his <13836 are
just; that he is just in all his <1024 and that he is <5264 unto
the <353 of men, and that he has all <509 to save <1097 man that
<10447 on his name and <10209 <71 <9601 meet for <7055

12:16 And now <771 I say unto you then <1295 a <248 even a <17525
<5 <389 is a <994 <1273 then is a time that <8189 dieth
in his <5446 as to a <1265 <21 <164 also die a <22 <22
yea, he <9 die as to <478 <10896 unto <8967

12:17 Then is the time when <362 torments <19 be as a lake of fire
and brimstone, <2790 flame ascendeth up forever and ever; and then is
the time that they <25 be chained down to an <151 <699
<312 to the <124 and <12633 of Satan, he <2474 subjected them
<13 to his will.

12:18 Then, I say unto you, they <36 be as <1439 <1261 had been no
<1439 made; for they <224 be <18503 <30 to God’s
justice; and they <10 die, <948 <22 is no more <1121

12:19 Now it came to pass that when Alma had made an end of <4018
<605 <760 the <894 <612 to be more astonished;

12:20 But <38 was one Antionah, who was a <7151 ruler <2711 <2891
came <212 and said unto him: What is this that thou hast <20734 that
man <889 rise from the dead and be <12711 from this <1245 to an
<1243 <362 that the soul can <1222 die?

12:21 What does the scripture mean, <233 <1673 that God placed
cherubim and a flaming <18397 on the east of the garden of Eden, lest
our <1272 parents <55 <8468 and <11510 of the <287 of the tree of
<1283 and live forever? And thus we see that <104 was no <5461
<19469 that they <29 live <6662

12:22 Now Alma said unto him: This is the <1432 <69 I was <936 to
explain, now we see that Adam did fall by the partaking of the
forbidden <11502 <198 to the word of God; and thus we see, that by
his fall, all <18757 <17276 a lost and <4782 <3045

12:23 And now <367 I say unto you that if it had been <82 for
Adam to have partaken of the <109 of the tree of life at that <5333
<104 <514 have been no <367 and the word <8 have been void,
<8372 God a liar, for he <2085 If thou eat thou <2170 surely die.

12:24 And we see that <1434 <20133 upon <22907 yea, the <6 <123
has been <686 of by <1301 <8 is the <417 <411 <866
<58 was a <23004 <9492 unto man in <15 he <964 <6104 <2500
this life <115 a probationary state; a time to <5115 to meet God; a
time to <8 for that <6146 <258 <28 has been <50 of by us,
<8 is <2905 the <977 of the dead.

12:25 Now, if it had not been for the plan of redemption, <23 was
laid from the <3381 of the <8792 <77 <643 have been no
<35 of the dead; but <11 was a plan of <414 laid,
<29 <427 <1181 to pass the <19 of the <1023 of <11 has
been <8075

12:26 And now <205 if it were <199 that our <310 <310 <49
have gone <384 and <204 of the tree of life they <189 have been
<521 miserable, <494 no preparatory <130 and thus the plan of
<63 <17 have been frustrated, and the word of God <9 have
been <216 taking none effect.

12:27 But <61 it was not so; but it was <3269 unto men that
they must die; and <150 <250 they must come to judgment, even that
same <6087 of <102 we have <3581 <4 is the end.

12:28 And <26 God had <38 that <507 <634 <383 come unto
man, <55 then he saw that it was <15070 that man <15 know
<942 the <21 <4363 he had <28 unto <2744

12:29 <2031 he sent <3901 to converse with <523 who <6094 men to
<1382 of his glory.

12:30 And they <559 from that time <156 to call on his <2084
<282 God <5810 with men, and made <1511 unto them the plan of
<242 <96 had been <12222 from the <242 of the <9556
and this he made <23 unto them <443 to <722 <5431 and
repentance and <6 holy <1003

12:31 Wherefore, he gave <6298 unto men, they <203 <225
transgressed the <4 <10 as to <109 <50 were temporal,
and <1796 as Gods, <2003 good from evil, placing <10191 in a
<341 to act, or <1060 <584 in a <8 to act <60 to <54
wills and pleasures, <1906 to do evil or to do good—

12:32 <146 God gave unto them <6419 <190 <64 made
<92 unto them the plan of <114 that they <181 not do <58
the penalty thereof <53 a <878 <239 <78 was an <800
<458 as to <87 <851 unto <8888 for on such the plan
of <300 <330 have no <984 for the <1071 of <4090 <9 not
be <5693 <84 to the supreme <23499 of God.

12:33 But God did call on men, in the name of his Son, (this <62 the
plan of <44 <64 was laid) <1385 If ye will <6213 and <1266
not your <1268 then will I have <10009 upon you, <5624 mine Only
<5678 Son;

12:34 <2426 <963 repenteth, and hardeneth not his <1334 he
<445 have <21518 on <27 <25 mine Only <24 Son, unto a
<9764 of his <2489 and <333 <19 <744 into my rest.

12:35 And <38 will <63 his <2818 and will do <4299 <346
I swear in my <4384 that he <28 not <29 into my <29

12:36 And now, my <5584 <330 I say unto you, that if ye will
<40 your <1262 ye <28 not <28 into the rest of the <5047
<333 your <14427 provoketh him that he <6971 down his <51
upon you as in the <290 provocation, yea, <176 to his word in the
last provocation as well as the <19795 to the <223 <3968
of your <17194 <1488 <23 to his <1317 unto the last <241
as well as the first.

12:37 And now, my <89 <997 we know <135 <5202 and they are
<11730 let us <4365 and <93 not our <195 that we provoke not the
Lord our God to pull down his <86 upon us in <32 his <294
<376 <231 he has <1485 unto us; but let us <122 into the rest
of God, <16 is <438 <81 to his <2796

Alma <2134 13

13:1 And <3983 my <77 I <604 cite your <3613 <9986 to the
time when the Lord God gave <57 <54 unto his children; and I
<22 that ye <370 <1922 that the Lord God <10818 <14859 <391
his holy order, <60 was <7 the <8591 of his Son, to <8582 <34
<375 unto the <917

13:2 And <2627 <10846 were <31 <23 the <23 of his Son, in a
<3357 that <4753 the <1123 <837 know in what <9 to look
<81 to his Son for redemption.

13:3 And this is the <18 <37 <63 they were ordained—being <2587
and <128 from the <566 of the <2697 <134 to the
foreknowledge of God, on <19989 of <506 <8928 <567 and good
works; in the <260 <12965 <411 left to <4630 good or evil; <286
they <503 <5330 good, and <18312 <8958 <3129 <6467 are
<51 with a holy calling, yea, with that holy <12481 <65 was
<61 with, and <57 to, a <797 <446 for such.

13:4 And thus they have been <32 to this holy <27 on <71 of
<72 <45 <5177 <14690 <179 reject the <3348 of God on <14 of
the hardness of <17 <370 and blindness of <5 minds, while, if it
had not been for this they <154 have had as <83 <10853 as <19
<5655

13:5 Or in fine, in the <116 <116 they were on the same standing with
<22 <10304 thus this holy <73 <130 <98 from the
<160 of the <160 for such as <77 not <344 <21 <343
<18 in and <510 the atonement of the Only <513 Son, who was
prepared—

13:6 And thus <21 <118 by this holy <150 and <250 unto the
high <14385 of the holy <256 of God, to <278 his <312
unto the <1587 of men, that they also <106 <367 into his rest—

13:7 This high <31 <44 <250 the <31 of his Son, <190 <5
was from the <91 of the <817 or in <6705 <1418 <21 <19206
<2975 of days or end of <19730 <10 <114 from eternity to all
eternity, <216 to his <272 of all <6533

13:8 Now they were <90 <53 this manner—being <100 with a holy
<101 and <11 with a holy ordinance, and <1018 upon them the
high <77 of the holy <392 <74 <20 and <16 and
high priesthood, is <68 <67 or end—

13:9 Thus they <13522 high <391 <16212 <50 the <98 of the Son,
the Only <169 of the <2771 who is <29 <29 of days or
end of <97 who is full of <6396 <6396 and <12198 And thus it is.
<9223

13:10 Now, as I said <1022 the holy <73 or this high
<70 <1190 were many who were <100 and <1269 high <66
of God; and it was on <317 of <246 <402 <402 and <6263
and <7 <12873 <1839 God, they choosing to <803 and work
<10 <6958 than to <23425

13:11 <918 they were <151 <105 this holy <59 and were
sanctified, and <33 <9419 were <10078 <13290 <285 the <13290 of
the Lamb.

13:12 Now they, <27 <206 <11868 by the Holy <6825 <446 <26
<27 made white, <12 pure and <9456 <66 God, <908 not look
upon sin save it were with abhorrence; and <108 were many, <468
<386 <4 who were made pure and <8471 into the rest of the Lord
<43 God.

13:13 And now, my <647 I <369 that ye <625 <8475 <4816
<52 God, and <1329 <1141 <1497 meet for <131 that ye may also
<330 into that <847

13:14 Yea, <26 <26 even as the <606 in the days of
Melchizedek, who was also a high <8347 <110 this same <243 <269 I
have <1261 who also took upon him the high <286 <1634

13:15 And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid tithes;
yea, even our <5678 <8 paid tithes of one-tenth part of all he
possessed.

13:16 Now <701 ordinances were <787 <58 this <12756 that <683
the <78 <424 look <678 on the Son of God, it <172 a type of his
<215 or it <9 his <5 and this that they <25 look <25 to
him for a <1009 of <160 <1992 that they <14 <133 into the rest
of the <3949

13:17 Now this <93 was a king over the land of Salem; and his
<67 had <7011 <7011 in <973 and abomination; yea, they had all
gone astray; they were full of all <748 of <19045

13:18 But <40 <264 <2765 <9174 <661 and <4165 the
<15078 of the high <157 <481 to the holy <175 of God, did
<6453 <1316 unto his <829 And <1074 they did <1646 and
<35 did <2975 <9675 in the land in his <22581 <757 he
was <347 the prince of peace, for he was the king of <92 and he
did <4517 <2554 his <24852

13:19 Now, <313 were many <278 him, and also <7 were many
afterwards, but none were greater; <1046 of him they have more
particularly made mention.

13:20 Now I need not rehearse the <18781 what I have said may suffice.
<4108 the <3043 are <45 you; if ye will wrest them it <1138
be to your own <2478

13:21 And now it came to pass that when Alma had said <258 <2393 unto
<1514 he <5210 <356 his hand unto them and <5055 with a <165
<12522 <1292 Now is the time to <1098 for the day of <3588
draweth nigh;

13:22 Yea, and the <5459 of the <4211 by the <3147 of <7337 doth
<8116 it unto all nations; yea, doth <7 it, that they may have
glad <24173 of <455 joy; yea, and he doth sound <76 glad <11
<2114 all his <2947 yea, even to them that are <17607 <23422 upon
the face of the <7928 <6152 they have come unto us.

13:23 And they are made <1474 unto us in plain terms, that we may
understand, that we <2210 err; and this <3868 of our <361 wanderers
in a strange <9635 <202 we are thus <7502 favored, for we have
<74 glad <74 <24051 unto us in all <9412 of our vineyard.

13:24 For <290 <1682 are <7156 it unto many at this time in our
<41 and this is for the <4504 of preparing the <982 of the
<870 of men to <5052 his word at the time of his coming in his
<1711

13:25 And now we only wait to hear the joyful news <72 unto us by
the <184 of <184 of his coming; for the time cometh, we know not
how soon. Would to God that it <459 be in my day; but let it be sooner
or later, in it I will <23544

13:26 And it <298 be made <166 unto just and holy men, by the <56
of <57 at the time of his coming, that the <298 of our <7906 may
be <12436 <445 to that <618 they have <2051 <822 him,
<7 was <12 to the <3070 of <6195 <8 was in <6116

13:27 And now, my <698 I wish from the inmost part of my <1583
yea, with <280 <23871 even unto pain, that ye <716 <9703 unto my
<999 and cast off your <576 and not procrastinate the day of your
repentance;

13:28 But that ye <27 <714 <714 <416 the <344 and call on
his holy name, and <12172 and pray continually, that ye may not be
tempted <7754 that <85 ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy
<3731 <1836 <10416 meek, submissive, patient, full of love and
all <10411

13:29 <7739 <918 on the <1595 <595 a hope that ye <173 <252
<4013 <13911 <10 the love of God <10374 in your <1187 that ye may
be <11511 up at the last day and <681 into his <814

13:30 And may the Lord <3106 unto you <835 that ye may not <845
down his <1553 upon you, that ye may not be <8864 down by the <2996 of
<4619 that ye may not <7136 the <1569 <3984

13:31 And Alma <3570 many more <233 unto the <452 <126 are not
<7018 in this <7100

Alma <1566 14

14:1 And it came to pass <813 he had made an end of <2625 unto the
<750 many of them did <4148 on his <217 and <2074 to <557 and
to search the scriptures.

14:2 But the more part of them were <12791 that they <351 <3723
Alma and <7128 for they were <5850 with <3759 <485 of the
plainness of his <90 unto Zeezrom; and they also said that <3106 had
lied unto <631 and had <5629 <3062 <851 law and also <5
<6 <5553 and <5634

14:3 And they were also <46 with Alma and <54 and <49 they
had <5801 so <3143 <27 <26 <4960 they <6452 to put
them away privily.

14:4 But it came to pass that they did not; but they took them and
<194 them with <881 cords, and took them <323 the <2747 <5442 of
the <8293

14:5 And the <153 went <718 and witnessed <57 them—testifying
that they had <96 <7 the law, and <67 <93 and <6564 of
the <6117 and also of all the <29 that were in the <577 and also
<93 that <834 was but one God, and that he <1128 send his Son
<696 the <243 but he <10 not save <2306 and many such <1745 did
the <40 <8849 <59 Alma and <5051 Now this was done <93
the <94 <94 of the <93

14:6 And it came to pass that <3560 was astonished at the <203 <290
had been spoken; and he also knew <521 the <1627 of the
<1628 <16 he had <2353 <70 the <56 by his <3873 words; and his
soul <277 to be harrowed up <948 a <3972 of his own guilt;
yea, he <15 to be <15484 <2788 by the <11574 of <3363

14:7 And it came to pass that he <21 to cry unto the <120 <880
<935 I am guilty, and <756 men are <1315 <108 God. And he
<22 to <24705 for them from that time forth; but they <192 him,
<30 Art thou also <10347 with the <15012 And they spit upon him,
and cast him out from <102 <314 and also all <1901 who <17079 in
the <134 <118 had been <650 by Alma and <305 and they cast them
out, and sent men to cast <24464 at <653

14:8 And they <3444 <250 wives and <798 <19725 and <2201
<42 or had been <10713 to <428 in the word of God they <165
that they <233 be cast into the <13457 and they also <35 <299
<37 <17905 <68 contained the holy scriptures, and cast them into
the fire <22052 that they <440 be burned and <8070 by <13475

14:9 And it came to pass that they took Alma and <2849 and <21183
them <45 to the <1828 of martyrdom, that they <34 <6868 the
<2194 of <130 who were consumed by <39

14:10 And when <465 saw the <219 of the <10864 and <111 who were
consuming in the <91 he also was pained; and he said unto <3837 How
can we <46 this <3489 scene? <1581 let us stretch <63 our
<21794 and <9501 the <3270 of God <114 is in us, and save them from
the flames.

14:11 But Alma said unto him: The <1966 constraineth me that I must
not <40 <40 mine <6465 for <2350 the Lord <3766 them up unto
himself, in <8127 and he doth <671 that they may do this <8896 or
that the <353 may do this <3121 unto <258 <889 to the <2006
of <188 <753 that the <3501 <77 he <772 <85 upon them
in his <729 may be <3511 and the <1667 of the innocent <17 <3550 as
a <119 <450 <38 yea, and cry <8224 <6 them at the last
day.

14:12 Now <167 said unto <146 <365 <9163 they will burn us
<7852

14:13 And Alma <3095 Be it <75 to the will of the <1488 But,
<1125 our work is not finished; <1405 they burn us not.

14:14 Now it came to pass that when the <18974 of <234 who had been
cast into the fire were <13757 and also the <304 <113 were cast
in with <93 the <535 <535 of the land came and <7935 <438 Alma
and <288 as they were bound; and he smote them with his hand upon
<152 cheeks, and said unto <7004 After what ye have <25549 will ye
<1509 <4564 unto this <486 that they <149 be cast into a lake of
fire and brimstone?

14:15 <136 ye see that ye had not <270 to save <95 who had been
cast into the fire; <6061 has God <5091 them <762 they were of thy
<26663 And the <94 <77 them <57 upon <74 <74 and asked:
What say ye for yourselves?

14:16 Now this <21 was <899 the <1594 and <1022 of Nehor, who slew
Gideon.

14:17 And it came to pass that Alma and <219 <5323 him nothing;
and he <52 them <2501 and <8718 them to the <6291 to be cast
into <8104

14:18 And when they had been cast into prison <5845 days, <754 came
many <6509 and <6124 and <2500 and <17363 who were of the
profession of <21656 and they came in unto the <28 to see <207 and
they questioned them <675 many <701 but they <74 them nothing.

14:19 And it came to pass that the <114 <224 <224 <28 and <295
Why do ye not <5778 the <624 of this people? Know ye not that I have
<185 to <7136 you up unto the flames? And he <9451 them to
speak; but they <55 <54

14:20 And it came to pass that they <10769 and went <187 ways, but
came <194 on the morrow; and the <68 also <152 them <10 on <17
cheeks. And many came <478 <611 and <13 <81 <726 Will ye <419
<18 and <24 this <280 and <4035 our law? If ye have such <1324
<81 why do ye not <84 <232

14:21 And many such <901 did they say unto <40 gnashing <52 teeth
upon <6 and spitting upon <4 and <51 How <321 we look when
we are damned?

14:22 And many such <2804 yea, all <1886 of such <40 did they say
unto <951 and thus they did mock them for many <10273 And they did
withhold food from them that they <678 hunger, and water that they
<7 thirst; and they also did take from them <75 clothes that they
were naked; and thus they were <1081 with <1080 <1080 and <10169 in
<288

14:23 And it came to pass <342 they had thus <18790 for many <291
(and it was on the twelfth day, in the <8066 <8072 in the <4 year
of the <1914 of the <1088 over the <632 of Nephi) that the <498
<178 over the land of <11228 and many of <78 teachers and <3
<1114 went in unto the <317 <18371 Alma and <382 were <83 with
cords.

14:24 And the <37 <36 <306 <306 <175 and <228 them <393 and
said unto <517 If ye have the <218 of God <216 <1512 from
<994 bands, and then we will <903 that the Lord will <1307 this
<81 <632 to your <23346

14:25 And it came to pass that they all went <282 and <53 <56
<9730 the same <1362 even <4461 the <5545 and when the last had
<988 unto them the <62 of God was upon Alma and <610 and they
rose and <91 upon <118 feet.

14:26 And Alma <19781 <273 How long <274 we <794 <85 <313
<17451 O Lord? O <1604 give us strength <81 to our <537
<669 is in <13421 even unto deliverance. And they broke the cords
with <14 they were <662 and when the <108 saw <8393 they <1111 to
flee, for the fear of <953 had come upon <1057

14:27 And it came to pass that so <64 was <82 fear that they fell
to the <5681 and did not <20067 the outer door of the prison; and the
<9979 <27105 <19905 and the walls of the <223 were rent in twain,
so that they fell to the <1996 and the <222 <23260 and the <580
and <579 and <579 who <174 upon Alma and <150 were <7920
by the fall thereof.

14:28 And Alma and <264 came <197 out of the <7935 and they were
not hurt; for the Lord had <3917 unto them <3464 <152 to <98
<153 <138 was in <22049 And they straightway came <32 out of the
<96 and they were <16709 from <22 bands; and the <94 had
<4051 to the <122 and <4436 soul <15930 the <109 thereof, save it
were Alma and <84 was slain; and they <42 came <42 into
the city.

14:29 Now the <192 <1761 <5271 a <168 noise came running <13817
by multitudes to know the <6222 of it; and when they saw Alma and
<112 <2034 <38 out of the <112 and the <60 <3594 had <72
to the <73 they were <20359 with <42 <20358 and fled from the
<9986 of Alma and <32 even as a goat fleeth with her young from
two lions; and thus they did flee from the <24 of Alma and <1498

Alma <1752 15

15:1 And it came to pass that Alma and <43 were <712 to depart
out of that <11301 and they departed, and came out even into the land of
Sidom; and <1046 <822 they <4717 all the <130 who had <723 out
of the land of <8882 who had been cast out and stoned, <936
they <1368 in the <785 of <11085

15:2 And they related unto them all that had <27305 unto <213 <1396
and <8345 and also <1557 <17887 and of <11 <442 of
<393

15:3 And also <1587 lay sick at Sidom, with a burning fever, <263
was <1409 by the <162 tribulations of his mind on <2910 of his
<1759 for he supposed that Alma and <125 were no <5666 and he
<11 that they had been <337 <90 of his <27003 And this
<37 sin, and his many <3103 <2099 did harrow up his mind <529 it did
<3033 <2864 sore, <263 no <13056 <1183 he <457 to
be scorched with a <76 heat.

15:4 Now, when he <283 that Alma and <64 were in the land of <98
his <3714 <30 to take courage; and he sent a <11418 immediately unto
<590 <25637 them to come unto him.

15:5 And it came to pass that they went immediately, obeying the
<27 <133 he had sent unto <819 and they went in unto the <8720
unto <1940 and they <226 him upon his bed, <21918 <2440 very low
with a <89 fever; and his mind also was <110 sore <136 of
his <8047 and when he saw them he <2593 <359 his <7803 and
besought them that they <2226 heal him.

15:6 And it came to pass that Alma said unto him, <3214 him by the
hand: <6717 thou in the <239 of <5957 unto <17188

15:7 And he <1036 and <1074 Yea, I <746 all the <287 that thou
hast taught.

15:8 And Alma <18 If thou believest in the <3504 of <37 thou
canst be healed.

15:9 And he <20 Yea, I <38 <543 to thy <776

15:10 And then Alma <2689 unto the <713 <727 O Lord our God, have
<3944 on this man, and heal him <29 to his <571 <175 is in
<572

15:11 And when Alma had said <753 <799 <333 leaped upon his feet,
and <234 to walk; and this was done to the <297 <27747 of all
the <6348 and the <5549 of this went <169 <11424 all the
land of Sidom.

15:12 And Alma <9666 <44 unto the <2344 and he <43 from that
time <26 to <1417 unto the <2925

15:13 And Alma <7404 a <11466 in the land of <305 and
<17785 <3308 and <970 in the <2077 to <12122 unto the Lord
<1835 were <2232 to be <18826

15:14 And it came to pass that they were many; for they did <14861 in
from all the region <5909 <1309 <47 and were <29

15:15 But as to the <529 that were in the land of <526 they yet
remained a <9564 and a <9564 <128 and they <14645 not
of <501 <433 ascribing all the <266 of Alma and <403 to the <8521
for they were of the <1383 of <1454 and did not <232 in the
<3054 of <31 <6592

15:16 And it came to pass that Alma and <746 <37 <466 forsaken
all his <7479 and <7086 and his <13715 <1232 <232 were in the
land of <83 for the word of God, he <397 <27478 by <1561 who
were once his <25167 and also by his <3259 and his kindred;

15:17 <4237 <1193 Alma <51 <189 the <189 at <139
<4087 a <248 check, yea, <5 that the <137 were checked as to
the <14056 of <91 <1805 and <232 to <2640 <4430 <1148 God,
and <8 to <21866 <8 <812 at <17 sanctuaries to
<14040 God <16 the altar, watching and praying <2648 that
they <1290 be <1562 from <5183 and from <4159 and from
destruction—

15:18 Now as I <5090 Alma <78 seen all <338 <122 <597 he
took <139 and came over to the land of <12772 and took him to his
own <9065 and did <8861 unto him in his <27700 and
<21012 him in the <1824

15:19 And thus <6290 the <1300 year of the <1299 of the <1299 over the
<123 of <12774

Alma <840 16

16:1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the <31 of the
<32 over the <31 of <9628 on the <19416 day of the <2652 <1355
<837 <104 been much <3294 in the land of <95 <10 <10
been no wars nor <18335 for a <22275 <20592 of <3730 even <730
the <35 day of the <35 month in the <59 <18821 <28 was a cry
of war <722 <452 the <2415

16:2 For <892 the <25333 of the <10312 had come in upon the
<12748 side, into the <12760 of the <426 even into the city of
<293 and <228 to slay the <98 and <1353 the <1059

16:3 And now it came to <24725 <235 the <20695 <3683 raise a
sufficient army to <15292 them out of the <43 they had <2248 the
<36 who were in the city of <49 and also some around the
<66 of <8657 and <5823 <4124 <5824 into the <12899

16:4 Now it came to pass that the <54 were <503 to <1273
<366 who had been <2277 away <27 into the <27

16:5 <361 he that had been <4882 <1262 captain over the
<132 of the <8024 (and his name was Zoram, and he had two sons,
Lehi and Aha)—now Zoram and his two <9 <4797 that Alma was high
<3706 over the <12635 and <211 <178 that he had the <3082 of
<10677 <330 they went unto him and <27462 of him to know
whither the Lord <814 that they <2412 go into the <188 in
<2847 of <399 <3100 who had been <124 <96 by the <19589

16:6 And it came to pass that Alma <27218 of the Lord <1068 the
matter. And Alma <9580 and said unto <1582 <2069 the <238
will <9157 the <13066 <19550 in the <12345 <20986 away up <6560 the
<177 of the land of Manti. And <2320 <283 <1516 ye meet <976 on
the east of the <30 <13096 and <14 the Lord will <1619 unto thee
thy <14611 who have been <84 <84 by the <84

16:7 And it came to pass that <157 and his sons <21147 over the <38
<39 with <115 <21977 and marched away <69 the <68 of Manti
into the <81 <81 <609 was on the east side of the <27
<21194

16:8 And they came upon the <221 of the <10645 and the <118
were <3504 and driven into the <18439 and they took <53
<85 who had been <85 <85 by the <25 and <104 was not
one soul of them had been lost that were <19 captive. And they were
<2611 by <33 <32 to <27057 <4 own lands.

16:9 And thus <529 the <439 year of the <2132 the <66
<261 been <65 out of the <373 and the <370 of <1825 were
<10853 yea, <1491 <7620 soul of the Ammonihahites was <4989
and also <46 <683 <12835 <124 they said God <413 not destroy,
<1109 of its greatness.

16:10 But <476 in one day it was left desolate; and the carcasses
were mangled by dogs and wild <21181 of the <379

16:11 <9594 <740 many days <50 dead <2423 were <19114 up
upon the face of the <1493 and they were covered with a shallow
covering. And now so <74 was the scent <1516 that the <100 did
not go in to <136 the land of <109 for many years. And it was
<3890 Desolation of Nehors; for they were of the <880 of <880
who were <1604 and <68 <28024 <922 desolate.

16:12 And the <157 did not come <2158 to war <2571 the <490
<624 the fourteenth year of the <674 of the <673 over the <69 of
<705 And thus for <2329 <24831 did the <11 of <13290 have <19820
<674 in all the <634

16:13 And Alma and <784 went <1073 <23900 <944 to the <25
in <72 temples, and in <4 sanctuaries, and also in <5
synagogues, <199 were built <158 the <2167 of the Jews.

16:14 And as many as <482 hear <22 <1169 unto them they did <6545
the word of God, <4458 any <23219 of persons, continually.

16:15 And thus did Alma and <68 go <10523 and also many more who had
been <4805 for the work, to <1153 the word <731 all the <98
And the establishment of the <965 <4456 general <13 the <303
in all the <1115 <1115 <18582 <3028 all the <106 of the <22449

16:16 And <373 was no <19547 <16 <1439 the Lord did pour out his
<2838 on all the face of the land to <5756 the <5016 of the <2912
of men, or to <11 <115 <3833 to <3575 the word <140 <603 be
<3031 <41 them at the time of his coming—

16:17 That they <995 not be <6477 <230 the <5157 that they <9
not be unbelieving, and go on to <6201 but that they <13
<46 the word with joy, and as a branch be grafted into the true
vine, that they <20 <3615 into the rest of the Lord <75 God.

16:18 Now <765 <1287 who did go <241 <77 the <133 did <164
<65 all lyings, and deceivings, and <19820 and strifes, and
<19821 and revilings, and <25628 <23345 <25627 <23342
<23347 adultery, and all <247 of lasciviousness, <10920 that
<1070 <2418 <10897 not so to be—

16:19 Holding <49 <12 <132 must shortly <11468 yea, holding <8
the <1929 of the Son of God, his sufferings and <1119 and also the
<5858 of the <5912

16:20 And many of the <83 did <6934 <738 the <3128 <2341 the
Son of God <178 <45 and they were <180 that he <310 <10008 unto
them <329 his resurrection; and this the <31 did hear with <469
joy and gladness.

16:21 And now <21 the <280 had been <1250 <281 all the
land—having got the victory over the <6760 and the word of God <1293
<10804 in its purity in all the <304 and the Lord pouring out his
<11404 upon the people—thus <635 the <459 year of the <459
of the <460 over the <71 of <459

Alma <1164 17

17:1 And now it came to pass that as Alma was <10553 from the land
of <14034 southward, away to the land of <22483 <628 to his
<22416 he met with the sons of <9220 <26 <10460 the
land of <15541

17:2 Now <212 sons of <16 were with Alma at the time the <8267
<5128 <10591 unto him; <967 Alma did <28324 <1793 to see
his <5130 and what added more to his joy, they were <16758 his
<760 in the <1613 yea, and they had <4583 <2622 in the <1644
of the <29677 for they were men of a <4345 understanding and they had
searched the <4460 <7163 that they <343 know the word of
God.

17:3 But this is not all; they had <4705 <1418 to much <13776 and
fasting; <83 they had the <1058 of <1057 and the <5 of
<11735 and when they taught, they <264 with <1576 and <8222
of God.

17:4 And they had been teaching the word of God for the <6273 of
fourteen <658 <394 the <893 <848 had much success in <20083
many to the <108 of the <107 yea, by the <46 of <429 <1872
many were <897 <1255 the altar of God, to call on his name and
<28972 <19 sins <15 him.

17:5 Now <196 are the <9171 <398 attended them in <17
journeyings, for they had many afflictions; they did <2588 much, both
in body and in <23444 such as <2827 thirst and fatigue, and also much
<24211 in the spirit.

17:6 Now <46 were <40 journeyings: <4165 <977 leave of <6
<12620 <24771 in the <243 year of the <20274 <112 refused the
<7348 <66 <17 <1642 was <1293 to <10162 upon <1131 and also
this was the <627 of the <1752

17:7 <12322 they <2302 out of the land of <1470 and took
<34 <23279 and <3 spears, and <3 <21845 and <3 <21845 and
<4 slings; and this they did that they <248 provide food for
<234 <5494 in the <962

17:8 And thus they <48 into the <1270 with <30 <9109
<81 they had <28738 to go up to the land of <1550 to <604 the
word of God unto the <1198

17:9 And it came to pass that they journeyed many days in the
<1180 and they <10930 much and <17636 much that the Lord <540
<4270 unto them a <7284 of his <763 to go with <136 and <24913 with
<5 that they <96 be an <22566 in the <11207 of God to bring, if
it were possible, <90 <1357 the <289 to the <281 of
the <11721 to the <7 of the baseness of the <12359 of <21
<16251 <111 were not correct.

17:10 And it came to pass that the Lord did <11824 them with his <4415
and said unto <1372 Be comforted. And they were <4

17:11 And the Lord said unto them <13031 Go <695 <358 the <69
thy <74 and <4984 my <7451 yet ye <1376 be patient in
<12800 and <2893 that ye may show <25 good examples
unto them in me, and I will make an <120 of thee in my <122 unto
the <4878 of many <23198

17:12 And it came to pass that the <900 of the sons of <317 and
also <828 who were with <163 took courage to go <55 unto the
<1131 to <4888 unto them the word of God.

17:13 And it came to pass when they had arrived in the <1412 of the
land of the <112 that they <21758 <295 and <285 one
from <9809 trusting in the Lord that they <786 meet <1177 at the
<18615 of <188 harvest; for they <2559 that <777 was the work <195
they had undertaken.

17:14 And assuredly it was <8068 for they had undertaken to <312 the
word of God to a wild and a <991 and a ferocious <403 a <750
who <26310 in murdering the <1687 and robbing and plundering
<1067 and <61 <140 were set upon <20994 or upon gold and <2121
and <2121 stones; yet they <4404 to <1744 <482 <924 by
<34 and <955 that they <315 not <502 for them with <35
own <10499

17:15 Thus they were a very indolent <3447 many of whom did <2076
<16123 and the <21724 of God had <2874 upon them <1431 of the
<321 of <37 <12679 <18470 the <12204 of the Lord
were <12205 unto them on the <19710 of <7389

17:16 <1803 this was the <2931 for <151 the sons of <805 had
<141 the <1223 that <3906 they <84 <4681 them unto
<4805 that <9 they <9 <9 them to know of the plan of
<6111

17:17 <4071 they <222 <222 one from <219 and went
<268 <348 <275 <1537 man alone, <2495 to the word and <696 of
God <62 was <776 unto him.

17:18 Now Ammon <972 the <1878 <28 <28 or <5702 he did <2143
unto <8 and he <268 from <5 <1012 <635 <11219 them
<43 to <126 several stations, <9 <24855 the word of God
unto <19 or administered unto them <729 his departure; and thus
they took <24 <24 journeys <1040 the <1333

17:19 And <61 went to the land of <11809 the land <69 <1518
<54 the sons of <10 who also <1350 <589

17:20 And as <27 <5702 the land of <16 the <384 took him
and <3469 him, as was <54 <14784 to bind all the <1521 who fell
into <11 <4215 and carry them <78 the <25513 and thus it was left
to the pleasure of the king to slay <100 or to <9392 them in
<20208 or to cast them into <3139 or to cast them out of his
<1121 <136 to his will and <21131

17:21 And thus <84 was <2065 <55 the king who was over the land
of Ishmael; and his name was Lamoni; and he was a <11872 of
Ishmael.

17:22 And the king <1984 of <36 if it were his <9455 to <15558 in
the land <216 the <480 or <4 his <2660

17:23 And <24 said unto him: Yea, I <25 to <25 <17 this <430
for a <8905 yea, and <302 <1660 the day I die.

17:24 And it came to pass that king Lamoni was much pleased with <29752
and <3090 that his <8988 <520 be loosed; and he <763 that <54
<9 take one of his daughters to wife.

17:25 But <15 said unto him: Nay, but I will be thy servant.
<348 <13 <235 a <14021 to king Lamoni. And it came to pass
that he was set <90 <3102 <30806 to <5172 the <15344 of Lamoni,
<181 to the <239 of the <266

17:26 And <280 he had been in the service of the king <1753 <3791 as
he was with the Lamanitish <39 <11713 <399 with <261 <40 to
the <1415 of water, <394 was <315 the <3864 of Sebus, and all the
<300 <2343 <21 <21 hither, that they may have water—

17:27 <487 as <97 and the <42 of the king were driving
<47 <25 <25 to this <45 of <45 <1329 a <2469 <2469 of
the <214 who had been with <19 <19 to <16 <3711 and
<2088 the <8 of <41 and the <41 of the <11239 and they
<14 them <8118 that they fled many ways.

17:28 Now the <21 of the king <2456 to murmur, <3011 Now the
king will slay us, as he has our <1332 <602 <56 <48 were
<39 by the <12004 of <658 men. And they <30 to weep
<8557 <32 <2279 our <20 are <19 already.

17:29 Now they wept <33 of the fear of <464 <23756 Now when <86
saw this his <3265 was swollen <3594 him with joy; for, said he, I
will show <136 my <573 unto <55 my fellow-servants, or the <7
<184 is in me, in restoring <13 <57 unto the <120 that I may win
the <756 of <13 my <26 that I may lead them to <2908
in my <3140

17:30 And now, <20 were the <8216 of <340 when he saw the
<16571 of <922 whom he <26551 to be his <6628

17:31 And it came to pass that he flattered them by his <1969 <129
My <1014 be of good cheer and let us go in <2458 of the <23914
and we will <17496 them <2867 and <718 them back unto the <248 of
water; and thus we will <22957 the <109 unto the king and he will
not slay us.

17:32 And it came to pass that they went in <51 of the <51 and
they did <18139 <105 and they rushed <164 with much swiftness and
did head the <46 of the <155 and did <71 them <71 <978 to
the <69 of water.

17:33 And <131 men <14 <309 to scatter <260 flocks; but <222 said
unto his brethren: Encircle the <38 <2029 <3144 that they flee not;
and I go and <14252 with <175 men who do <30 our flocks.

17:34 <384 they did as <37 <3716 <662 and he went <82
and <52 to <28 with <59 who <6 by the <16454 of Sebus; and
they were in <391 not a few.

17:35 <518 they did not fear <119 for they <1068 that one of
<87 men <2387 slay him <508 to <7 pleasure, for they knew not
that the Lord had <13136 <931 that he <582 <2586 his sons out of
<22 <31067 <4688 did they know <16213 <1916 the <1716
<1660 they <1070 in the <4089 of <18 <1742 and for
this <971 they <87 to <115 the <135 of the <24863

17:36 But <115 <14 <111 and <406 to cast <5174 at them with his
sling; yea, with <6146 <363 he did sling <14 amongst <1109 and
thus he slew a <511 <120 of them <482 that they <33 to be
<5365 at his <12513 <7970 they were <5536 <432 of the
<3748 of <76 <321 and they were determined that he <687 fall;
<6072 <3206 that they <136 not hit him with <20 <23394 they
came <78 with clubs to slay him.

17:37 But <574 <1026 man that <5773 his club to <26005 <176 he
<4141 off <30 arms with his <11519 for he did <18659 <9 blows
by smiting <5 arms with the edge of his <23614 <93 that they
<94 to be <9459 and <5 to flee <876 him; yea, and they
were not few in number; and he <789 them to flee by the <4309 of
his arm.

17:38 Now six of them had <1193 by the sling, but he slew none save it
were <65 leader with his <79 and he <88 off as many of <12
arms as were <106 <2232 him, and they were not a few.

17:39 And when he had <2703 them afar off, he <2903 and they
watered <32 <238 and <8 them to the pasture of the <417 and
then went in unto the <8 <21516 the arms <594 had been <11673 off
by the <8378 of <160 of <364 who <1331 to slay him; and they were
<1010 in unto the king for a <14645 of the <1345 <33 they had
<9502

Alma <2134 18

18:1 And it came to pass that king <950 <154 that his <745
<248 <4800 <233 and <5668 to all the <37 <37 they had seen
<357 the <3010

18:2 And when they had all <5722 to the <21 <21 they had <5114
and he had <12224 of the faithfulness of <354 in preserving his
<560 and also of his <1503 <348 in contending <166 <107 who
<108 to slay him, he was <337 <777 and <3840 Surely,
this is more than a man. <786 is not this the Great <1778 who doth
send such <38 punishments upon this <1441 <358 of <181 murders?

18:3 And they <3916 the <173 and <40 Whether he be the <31
<32 or a man, we know not; but this much we do <17453 that he <6463
be <393 by the enemies of the <1242 <490 can they <467 the
king’s <231 when he is with us, <59 of his expertness and <69
strength; <408 we know that he is a friend to the <490 And now,
O <70 we do not <809 that a man has such <28 <4499 for we know
he <63 be <885

18:4 And now, when the king <3265 <649 <789 he said unto <1828 Now I
know that it is the <107 <9662 and he has come down at this time to
<775 your lives, that I <1512 not slay you as I did your <843
Now this is the <31 <137 of whom our <6413 have <8383

18:5 Now this was the <14761 of <1155 <242 he had <6878 from
his <2126 that <2750 was a <31 <31460 Notwithstanding they
<4381 in a <8 <39 they <679 that <16692 they did was
<28720 <21452 <310 <480 to fear <240 with fear lest
he had done wrong in slaying his servants;

18:6 For he had <193 many of them <177 <235 <1062 had <1039
<5 <190 at the <822 of <890 and <22529 <15 they had had
<14 <14 <18 they were <160

18:7 Now it was the practice of <160 <1197 to <370 by the <782
of Sebus to <234 the <28 of the <289 that <7093 they <149
<1217 away many that were <41 unto <45 own <1463 it <1090 a
<38 of plunder <1299 <4827

18:8 And it came to pass that king <116 <1438 of his servants,
<1005 Where is this man that has such <246 power?

18:9 And they said unto him: <366 he is <22376 thy horses. Now the
king had <881 his <34 previous to the time of the watering
of <71 <421 that they <472 <2909 his horses and chariots, and
conduct him <480 to the land of <21862 for <208 had been a <59
feast <3595 at the land of <2242 by the <2335 of <235 who was
king over all the <1682

18:10 Now when king <102 <316 that <482 was <6796 his <54
and his chariots he was more <714 <191 of the <500 of
<595 <119 Surely <58 has not been any <1458 <146 all my
<559 that has been so <16055 as this man; for even he doth
<8009 all my <7711 to execute <169

18:11 Now I <8850 know that this is the <298 <2211 and I <951
<1581 him that he come in unto me, but I <26210 not.

18:12 And it came to pass that when <94 had made ready the <95 and
the <95 for the king and his <176 he went in unto the <462
and he saw that the countenance of the king was changed; <992 he
was <1110 to <13329 out of his <9445

18:13 And one of the <524 <116 said unto him, Rabbanah, <406 is,
<280 interpreted, powerful or <192 <46 considering <220 <28114 to
be <26156 and thus he said unto him: <23 the king <29148
thee to stay.

18:14 <1104 <94 turned <16841 unto the <32 and said unto him:
What wilt thou that I <257 do for <23864 O king? And the king <632
him not for the <2702 of an hour, <1122 to <62 <9045 for he knew
not what he <30 say unto him.

18:15 And it came to pass that <60 said unto him <11087 What desirest
thou of me? But the king <49 him not.

18:16 And it came to pass that <256 <120 <15664 with the <512 of
God, <156 he <12909 the <1426 of the <643 And he said unto
him: Is it <287 thou hast <305 that I defended thy <160 and thy
<368 and slew seven of <92 <509 with the <1137 and with the
<1036 and <973 off the arms of <22858 in <5857 to defend thy <483
and thy <548 <1089 is it this that <29447 thy marvelings?

18:17 I say unto you, what is it, that thy marvelings are so great?
<450 I am a man, and am thy servant; <741 <608 thou
<129 <231 is right, that will I do.

18:18 Now when the king had <97 <558 <718 he marveled <5504 for
he <10523 that <163 <1178 discern his thoughts; but <2263
<5377 king <424 did open his <18733 and said unto him: Who art <15642
Art thou that <372 <372 who <10422 all <11331

18:19 <36 <186 and said unto him: I am not.

18:20 And the king <878 How <11357 thou the <180 of my heart?
Thou mayest <10553 boldly, and tell me <991 <80 <11266 and also
tell me by what <961 ye slew and <166 off the arms of my <182
that <633 my flocks—

18:21 And now, if thou wilt tell me <37 <37 <4424 <140
thou <140 I will give unto thee; and if it were needed, I <466
<25709 thee with my armies; but I know that thou art more <391 than
all they; <776 <35 thou <34 of me I will <2787 it
unto <10458

18:22 Now <125 <297 wise, yet harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt
thou <7209 unto my <185 if I tell thee by what <104 I do <79
<157 And this is the <6381 that I <536 of <43

18:23 And the king <169 him, and <157 Yea, I will <967 all thy
<1776 And thus he was <10743 with guile.

18:24 And <69 <862 to <169 unto him with boldness, and said unto
him: <5004 thou that <635 is a God?

18:25 And he <11572 and said unto him: I do not know what that
meaneth.

18:26 And then <45 <67 <34 thou that <34 is a <257 Spirit?

18:27 And he <4613 Yea.

18:28 And <23 <23 This is God. And <6 said unto him <467
<33 thou that this <31 <288 who is God, <22052 all <1228
<350 are in <11343 and in the <14738

18:29 And he <38 Yea, I <127 that he <24 all <24 <23 are
in the <5650 but I do not know the heavens.

18:30 And <60 said unto him: The <27858 is a <966 <3565 God dwells
and all his holy angels.

18:31 And king <378 <52 Is it <7377 the <64

18:32 And <36 <12 Yea, and he looketh down upon all the <3788 of
men; and he <387 all the <362 and <10584 of the <10583 for by his
hand were they all <90 from the beginning.

18:33 And king <55 <43 I <106 all <262 <104 <104 thou hast
<1130 Art thou sent from God?

18:34 <64 said unto him: I am a man; and man in the <8407 was
<46 <2286 the <21983 of God, and I am <2261 by his Holy <623 to
<8570 <48 <48 unto this <1052 that they may be <3367 to a
<3097 of that <62 is just and <13927

18:35 And a <3155 of that <34 <20577 in me, <18 giveth me
<31208 and also <354 <726 to my <5211 and <18171 <14 are
in God.

18:36 Now when <91 had said <62 <383 he <330 at the <31270 of
the <9662 and also the <8 of Adam, and told him all the <83
<476 the fall of man, and <32910 and laid <1699 him the
<6657 and the holy <3564 of the <102 <59 had been <6048 by
the <21890 even down to the time that <711 <1275 <14468 left
<28995

18:37 And he also <42 unto them (for it was unto the king and to
his servants) all the journeyings of <31 <1327 in the <3301
and all <8 <3874 with hunger and thirst, and <7 travail, and
so <25227

18:38 And he also <46 unto them <97 the rebellions of
<25158 and <25157 and the sons of <2757 yea, all <31 <14
did he relate unto <1925 and he expounded unto them all the <114 and
<113 from the time that Lehi left <16115 down to the present
<24081

18:39 But this is not all; for he <33 unto them the plan of
<9492 <142 was <8766 from the <8788 of the <8788 and he
also made <7873 unto them <83 the <3988 of <6155 and all the
<9478 of the Lord did he make <19 unto <1139

18:40 And it came to pass that <311 he had said all <238 <689 and
<63 them to the <1022 that the king <1455 all his <594

18:41 And he <257 to cry unto the <5511 <1215 O <3 have mercy;
<292 to thy abundant <5514 <90 thou hast had upon the <2757 of
<1279 have upon me, and my <2783

18:42 And now, when he had said <853 he fell unto the <4511 as if he
were <4079

18:43 And it came to pass that his <987 took him and <1863 him in
unto his wife, and laid him upon a bed; and he lay as if he were dead
for the <1104 of two days and two nights; and his <27 and his <4931
and his <2794 mourned over him, <141 the <4187 of the <2660
<24517 lamenting his loss.

Alma <1902 19

19:1 And it came to pass that <27 two days and two nights they were
<1247 to take his body and lay it in a sepulchre, <144 they had made
for the <8193 of <25758 <295 <118

19:2 Now the queen <3128 <1010 of the fame of <1140 <1132 she
sent and <4989 that he <1190 come in unto her.

19:3 And it came to pass that <473 did as he was commanded, and went
in unto the queen, and <32 to know what she <923 that he <37
do.

19:4 And she said unto him: The <179 of my husband have made it
<293 unto me that thou art a <14673 of a holy God, and that thou hast
<551 to do many <2323 <322 in his <9974

19:5 <2467 if this is the <15593 I <61 that ye <61 go in and
see my husband, for he has been laid upon his bed for the <217 of two
days and two <218 and some say that he is not <10209 but <5222 say
that he is dead and that he stinketh, and that he <4405 to be <9952 in
the sepulchre; but as for myself, to me he doth not stink.

19:6 Now, this was what <158 desired, for he knew that king <750 was
<7727 the <110 of God; he knew that the dark veil of <19656 was
<1049 cast away from his <4029 and the <15723 <241 did <3 up his
<10 <7 was the <8 of the <15559 of God, <9 was a <14956
<11 of his goodness—yea, this <5 had infused such joy into his
<17749 the cloud of darkness <261 been dispelled, and that the <19
of <9775 life was lit up in his <21 yea, he knew that this had
overcome his natural <12020 and he was <402 away in God—

19:7 <197 what the <304 <260 of him was his only desire.
<12 he went in to see the king <488 as the <20 had
<22 him; and he saw the <526 and he knew that he was not <348

19:8 And he said unto the queen: He is not <208 but he sleepeth in
God, and on the <26873 he <3883 rise <19306 <362 bury him not.

19:9 And <190 said unto her: <1070 thou <20844 And she said unto
him: I have had no <7543 save thy <4736 and the word of our <1470
<2606 I <960 that it <45 be <93 as thou hast said.

19:10 And <45 said unto her: <17877 art thou <1539 of thy
<9304 <28483 I say unto <1641 woman, <1159 has not been such <1695
<905 <1830 all the <609 of the <4864

19:11 And it came to pass that she watched over the bed of her <353
from that time even <3385 that time on the <120 <247 <63 had
<1927 that he <379 rise.

19:12 And it came to pass that he arose, <93 to the <4373 of
Ammon; and as he <11 he <6310 <1971 his hand unto the <84 and
<1081 <101 be the name of God, and <3671 art thou.

19:13 For as sure as thou livest, <1613 I have seen my Redeemer; and
he <146 come <5014 and be born of a <41 and he <11 <12548 all
<10840 who <166 on his <15843 Now, when he had said <785 <1023 his
<3201 was <3201 <3201 him, and he sunk <2999 with joy; and the <277
also sunk <24152 <392 overpowered by the <2258

19:14 Now <129 <2794 the <1090 of the Lord poured out <118 to
his <14339 upon the <692 his <2822 who had been the <2898 of
so much mourning <195 the <3983 or <4 all the <199 of God
<225 of <666 <30532 and <3 traditions, he fell upon his
knees, and <849 to pour out his soul in <20654 and thanksgiving to God
for what he had done for his <2954 and he was also <88 with
joy; and thus they all <3496 had sunk to the <19887

19:15 Now, when the <650 of the king had seen that they had fallen,
they also <59 to cry unto God, for the fear of the Lord had come upon
them <7484 for it was they who had <2995 <1159 the king and <2664
unto him <996 the <316 <563 of Ammon.

19:16 And it came to pass that they did call on the name of the <956
in <127 <11476 even <311 they had all <2867 to the <929 save it
were one of the <3591 <15156 <11356 name was Abish, she <551 been
converted unto the Lord for many <6013 on <6786 of a remarkable
vision of her father—

19:17 Thus, <25 been <24 to the <58 and <11230 <8 made it
<29244 <1880 when she saw that all the <142 of <664 had
<68 to the <68 and also her mistress, the <829 and the <542
and <262 lay prostrate upon the <17 she knew that it was the <126
of God; and <21616 that this opportunity, by <11111 <827 unto the
<253 what had <6915 <260 <3267 that by beholding this scene it
<807 <280 them to <347 in the <35 of God, <558 she ran
<412 from <6763 to <6228 <37 it <38 unto the <1089

19:18 And they <220 to <6309 <4140 <3371 unto the <22 of
the <2077 And <520 came a multitude, and to <180 <6602 they
<1971 the <99 and the <105 and <11 <122 <101 upon the
<102 and they all lay <28 as <11486 they were <11076 and they also
saw <994 and <454 he was a Nephite.

19:19 And now the <110 <67 to murmur <110 themselves; some <7475
that it was a <265 evil that had come upon <124 or upon the king and
his <106 <387 he had <7632 that the Nephite <557 <12986 in
the <2474

19:20 But <912 rebuked <29 <1237 The king hath <1560 this evil
upon his <32 <32 he slew his <99 who had had <104 <2153
<1991 at the <2648 of Sebus.

19:21 And they were also <38 by <2977 men who had <354 at the
<21 of <2668 and <28 the <32 <631 <29983 to the <147
for they were <3322 with <250 <54 of the <3345 <16 he had <2741
of <56 <2048 at the <33 of <3911 <4850 defending the <33 of
the <193

19:22 Now, one of <98 <354 brother had been <30 with the <3155 of
<171 <567 <5185 <49 with <5 drew his <11 and went
<252 that he <2732 let it fall upon <15 to slay him; and as he
<3243 the <22 to <3349 him, <203 he fell <868

19:23 Now we see that <90 <2215 not be slain, for the Lord had said
unto <4692 his father: I will <27421 him, and it <670 be unto him
<619 to thy faith—therefore, <3541 trusted him unto the <6530

19:24 And it came to pass that when the <12702 <295 that the man
had <410 <919 who <76 the <76 to slay <89 fear came upon
them all, and they <2617 not put <109 <155 <4781 to <21856 him or any
of <201 who had fallen; and they <293 to marvel <716 <294
<363 what <98 be the <401 of this <295 <3068 or what all
<745 <1747 <14 mean.

19:25 And it came to pass that <353 were many <33 them who said that
<134 was the <2038 <2038 and <297 said he was sent by the <10
<3077

19:26 But <15 <274 them all, <355 that he was a monster, who
had been sent from the <4436 to <33652 <1610

19:27 And <56 were some who said that <53 was sent by the <45
<793 to <29686 them <287 of <124 <7217 and that it was the
<16 <15 that had <9361 <5262 the <786 who had ever
<6774 them out of <24 <3725 and they said that it was this <25
<26 who had <6551 so many of <18 <827 the <4272

19:28 And thus the <28946 <163 to be <301 sharp <131 <85
And <335 they were thus contending, the woman <2869 who had <3429
the <228 to be <28621 <545 <32973 and when she saw the
<35 <374 was <32 the <17 she was <39 sorrowful,
even unto tears.

19:29 And it came to pass that she went and took the <934 by the <7326
that <4447 she <356 <6653 her from the ground; and as soon as she
touched her hand she arose and <455 upon her <7210 and <7254 with a
loud <9943 <508 O <1038 Jesus, who has <8544 me from an <8846
hell! O <12 God, have <1752 on this people!

19:30 And when she had said <1738 she clasped her <4646 <434 <2739
with joy, <9436 many <1104 <108 were not understood; and when she
had done <23 she took the <508 <3057 by the <95 and <6529 he
<79 and <79 upon his <8062

19:31 And he, <7496 <1034 the <147 <145 his <2051 went
<366 and <189 to rebuke <503 and to <2169 them the <56 <56 he
had <1673 from the <9781 of <1167 and as many as <10 his <17
believed, and were <852 unto the <442

19:32 But <302 were many <50 them who <789 not hear his <8548
<785 they went <256 way.

19:33 And it came to pass that when <324 <92 he also <4850
unto <72 and also did all the <663 of <4710 and they did all
<5193 unto the <738 the selfsame thing—that <41 <4329 had been
<3043 that they had no more <2569 to do <13447

19:34 And <571 many did <30 unto the <30 that they had seen
<10011 and had <11663 with <2090 and thus they had told them <471
of God, and of his <12378

19:35 And it came to pass that <118 were many that did <902 in
<70 <117 and as many as did <10 were baptized; and they <4680
a <14327 <187 and they did <5368 a <5996 <146 <373

19:36 And thus the work of the Lord did commence <15 the <17872
thus the Lord did begin to pour out his <425 upon <86 and we see
that his arm is <5135 to all <109 who will <10751 and <63 on
his <1323

Alma <1956 20

20:1 And it came to pass that when they had <6065 a <74 in
that <3461 that king <1070 <1604 that <204 <884 go with him to
the land of <2096 that he <403 show him unto his <10425

20:2 And the <10307 of the Lord came to <31 <393 Thou <12167 not go
up to the land of <33 for <201 the king will seek thy <9921 but
thou <21 go to the land of Middoni; for <18 thy <835 <34633
and also Muloki and Ammah are in <8608

20:3 Now it came to pass that when <56 had <337 <398 he said unto
<2856 <3067 my <33 and <893 are in <8250 at Middoni, and I
go that I may <4335 <196

20:4 Now <123 said unto Ammon: I <3862 in the <4147 of the Lord
thou <7779 do all things. But <76 I will go with thee to the land
of <89 for the king of the land of <53 <930 name is
Antiomno, is a <3862 unto me; <389 I go to the land of <18
that I may flatter the king of the <192 and he will cast thy <92
out of <121 Now <78 said unto him: Who told thee that thy
<16 were in prison?

20:5 And <130 said unto him: No one hath told me, save it be God; and
he said unto me—Go and <124 thy <711 for they are in <141 in
the land of Middoni.

20:6 Now when <59 had <170 this he <704 that his <456 <265
make <3513 his <3513 and his chariots.

20:7 And he said unto <160 Come, I will go with thee down to the land
of <120 and <412 I will <9707 with the king that he will cast thy
<103 out of <118

20:8 And it came to pass that as <109 and <71 were <6307
<19772 they met the <3698 of <641 who was king over all the <1223

20:9 And <212 the <17 of <27 said unto him: Why did ye not
come to the <3738 on that <980 day when I made a <9 unto my <2385
and unto my <9121

20:10 And he also <1797 Whither art thou <5112 with this <19533 who
is one of the <2926 of a liar?

20:11 And it came to pass that <65 <2675 unto him <7327 he was
<31242 for he feared to offend him.

20:12 And he also told him all the <1059 of his tarrying in his own
<16314 that he did not go unto his <109 to the <89 <728 he had
prepared.

20:13 And now when <58 had <59 unto him all <1088 <2618
<136 to his <6475 his <30 was <1252 with him, and <106
<162 thou art <107 to <268 <22 <1007 who are sons of a
liar. <419 he robbed our <5707 and now his <117 are also come
<4683 us that they may, by <640 <16581 and <3 <6743 <13812
us, that they <1165 may rob us of our property.

20:14 Now the <65 of <81 <3970 him that he <298 slay <240
with the <16223 And he also <14 him that he <14 not go to the
land of <290 but that he <12 <3798 with him to the land of
<5490

20:15 But <46 said unto him: I will not slay <1265 <4338 will I
<27 to the land of <2862 but I go to the land of Middoni that I
may release the <327 of <27 for I know that they are just men
and holy <20850 of the true God.

20:16 Now when his <107 had <407 <161 <2016 he was <177 with him,
and he drew his <1334 that he <669 <1412 him to the <1912

20:17 But <127 <987 <969 and said unto him: <185 thou <647 not
slay thy son; <3495 it were <23361 that he <124 fall than
<2211 for <233 he has <8153 of his <12268 but if thou <19216
fall at this <3850 in <13980 <18882 thy soul <1343 not be <25464

20:18 And <3686 it is <12612 that thou <26 forbear; for if
thou <6 slay thy son, he <1093 an <9855 man, his <9861 <999
cry from the ground to the Lord his God, for vengeance to come upon
<3603 and <1184 thou wouldst lose thy soul.

20:19 Now when <111 had said <140 <1054 unto him, he <3536 him,
<783 I know that if I <107 slay my son, that I <6 shed
<61 <32409 for it is thou that hast <4643 to <7899 him.

20:20 And he <2262 <154 his hand to slay <2021 But <52
<20351 his <31531 and also <3710 his arm that he <127 not use it.

20:21 Now when the king saw that <26 <15 slay him, he <1159 to
<589 with <10 that he <122 <1594 his <23058

20:22 But <12 <13696 his <3922 and said unto him: <212 I will
<233 thee <14776 thou wilt <3700 unto me that my <288 may be cast
out of <619

20:23 Now the <1244 <35073 he <116 lose his <13217 <449 If thou wilt
<56 me I will <35 unto thee <3745 thou wilt ask, even to half
of the <34207

20:24 Now when <72 saw that he had <25732 upon the old king
<1676 to his desire, he said unto him: If thou wilt <42 that my
<76 may be cast out of <5947 and also that <407 may <5963 his
<563 and that ye be not displeased with him, but <29 that he may
do <46 to his own <3424 in <80 <3777 he thinketh, then
will I <95 <258 otherwise I will <136 thee to the <369

20:25 Now when <87 had said <259 <399 the king <183 to <7017
<1591 of his <179

20:26 And when he saw that <24 had no <1255 to <252 him, and when
he also saw the <731 love he had for his son <608 he was <4910
<4671 and <168 Because this is all that thou hast <2866 that
I <232 <492 thy <891 and <6883 that my son <124 <194
<125 his <124 <422 I will <118 unto you that my son may
<14 his <6855 from this time and <28147 and I will <26737 him no
more—

20:27 And I will also <32 unto thee that thy <180 may be cast out
of <181 and thou and thy <12 may come unto me, in my <34558
for I <1899 <3197 <117 to see <3942 For the king was <9
<106 at the <412 <755 he had <11851 and also at the <9
<10 had been <3558 by his son <130 <1070 he was <6937 to
learn <1132

20:28 And it came to pass that <170 and <123 proceeded on <725
<20727 <7241 the land of <1019 And <12 <9028 <16701 in the eyes
of the king of the <10849 <45 the <92 of <31 were <2155
<443 out of <362

20:29 And when <14 did meet them he was <1727 <1727 for
<1610 they were <28841 and <55 <28800 were worn <13 <248
of <558 <6315 with <7245 <9784 And they also had <2221 <7075
<3606 and all kinds of <7096 <2869 they were <6793 in
all <33 sufferings.

20:30 And, as it happened, it was <12 lot to have <2026 into the
<2008 of a more <6656 and a more <8812 <6657 <96 they
<256 not <4142 unto <25 <321 and they had cast them out, and had
<5322 <1596 and had <5361 them from <2382 to <2266 and from <3968
to place, even <2557 they had <6775 in the land of <1273 and <1127
they were <7147 and cast into <244 and <109 with <109 <9976 and
kept in <1199 for many <6171 and were <1944 by <180 and <599

Alma <1485 21

21:1 Now when <164 and his <183 <6592 <2089 in the
<6829 of the land of the <2782 <170 <34846 took his <222
<223 the land <260 was <3935 by the <15 <18267 <12563
it <3472 the land of <118 fathers’ nativity; and it was away joining
the <40 of <26734

21:2 Now the <5021 and the Amalekites and the <1571 of Amulon had
<7968 a <436 <8173 <48 was <48 <3850

21:3 Now the <25 of <80 were <25613 <14309 but
the <31 and the Amulonites were <7492 harder; <185 they did
<1123 the <22 that they <437 <12625 <71 <8880 that they
<7 wax <146 in <6170 and <11 abominations.

21:4 And it came to pass that <116 came to the city of <108 and
<7317 <539 to <6904 to the Amalekites. And he <8 to <8 to them
in <37 <8061 for they had <94 synagogues <130 the <4639 of
the <8170 for many of the <84 and the <84 were <16
the <17 of the Nehors.

21:5 <3278 as <61 <6661 into one of <41 <36 to <49
unto the <1762 and as he was <1998 unto <280 <198 <256 <1885
an Amalekite and <70 to <5970 with him, <877 What is that thou
hast testified? Hast thou seen an angel? Why do not <1852 <7816 unto
us? <15793 are not this <187 as good as thy <1338

21:6 Thou also sayest, <812 we <1770 we <529 perish. How <4613
thou the <17919 and <30705 of our <17245 How <11 thou that we
have <185 to repent? How <10 thou that we are not a <1856
<45 <856 we have <142 <8214 and we do <2758 ourselves
<2214 to <6988 God. We do <1821 that God will save all men.

21:7 Now <137 said unto him: <3351 thou that the Son of God <74
come to <3175 <3173 from <150 <15984

21:8 And the man said unto him: We do not <45 that thou <75 any
such thing. We do not <11 in <777 <21397 <21397 We do not
<9 that thou <20 of <1987 to <15963 <1244 do we <11 that
thy <4146 and also that our <5 did know <3045 the <20
<338 they spake, of that <5 is to <23182

21:9 Now <94 <205 to open the <4114 unto them <26 the
<4068 of <4068 and also <8 the <8049 of the <2571 and
that <235 <1034 be no <9570 for <109 save it were <12684 the
<13587 and <4204 of <29 and the <12977 of his <34460

21:10 And it came to pass as he <59 to <14939 <111 <80 unto them
they were <1290 with him, and <14 to mock him; and they <588 not
hear the <747 <95 he <18225

21:11 <326 when he saw that they <19 not hear his <606 he

<470 Ani-Anti, and <98 he <744 <1947 <8472 the word unto
<2076 and also <1954 and his <5648 And they <30058 with many
<3998 the <13384

21:12 And it came to pass that they saw that the <336 <64 <480
<57 <481 <494 they <64 and came over into the land of
<801 And they did <406 the word unto <12786 and few <4203 on
the <109 <78 they <9751

21:13 <8684 <203 and a <6244 <2899 of his <632 were
<675 and cast into <675 and the <27802 of them fled out of the
land of <1490 unto the regions <6445 about.

21:14 And <2762 who were cast into <694 <804 many <1655 and
they were <696 by the hand of <699 and <1512 and they were fed
and clothed.

21:15 And they went <875 <1624 to <2323 the <3706 and thus they were
<33 for the <573 time out of <10342 and thus they had suffered.

21:16 And they went <31 whithersoever they were led by the <2260 of
the <3299 <192 the word of God in <6301 synagogue of the
Amalekites, or in <8 assembly of the <657 <4786 they <314 be

21:17 And it came to pass that the Lord <282 to <18724 <571 <6301
that they <965 many to the <4680 of the <8065 yea, they did
<36566 many of <213 <9696 and of the <7466 of <7 <7786

21:18 And it came to pass that <828 and <146 <6243 from the land
of <182 to the land of <1685 <29 was the land of <37
inheritance.

21:19 And king <27 <270 not <1194 that <34 <748 serve him, or
be his <7114

21:20 But he <2081 that <331 <17 be <682 <578 in the land
of <7259 and he <15 that his <689 or the <311 who were <4101

21:21 And he did <1310 over <134 and he did <2654 them many <2254
And he did also <227 unto them that they were a <40 who were

the <64 of king <7278

21:23 And <187 did <443 unto the <75 of king <2712 and it came
to pass that he did <145 them all <581 <630 <2 <14193
to <2667 And he did exhort them daily, with all diligence; and
they gave heed unto his <387 and they were zealous for <21921 the
<5860 of God.

Alma <1117 22

22:1 Now, as <68 was thus <8417 the <68 of <267 <9866
we will <1977 to the <3707 of <506 and his <3846 for <958 he
<547 from the land of <310 he was led by the <414 to the land
of <2582 even to the <1224 of the king <132 was over all the land
save it were the land of <291 and he was the <218 of <144

22:2 And it came to pass that he went in unto him into the <5865
palace, with his <1546 and bowed <5830 <3860 the <255 and said
unto him: <920 O <8 we are the <593 of <544 whom thou hast
<523 out of <1409

22:3 And now, O <22 if thou wilt <1669 our <6348 we will be thy
servants. And the king said unto <6383 Arise, for I will <1558 unto you
your <22 and I will not <419 that ye <940 be my <4279 but I
will insist that ye <11 <7839 unto me; for I have been somewhat
<29491 in mind <1450 of the generosity and the <30486 of the
<697 of thy <2687 <3039 and I <1582 to know the <1039 why he has
not come up out of <190 with <1595

22:4 And <211 said unto the king: <128 the <199 of the Lord has
<813 him <22023 way; he has gone to the land of <382 to <304
the <252 of <189

22:5 Now the king said unto <122 What is this that ye have said
<324 the <45 of the <11199 <51 this is the <1831 <239 doth
trouble me.

22:6 And <4070 what is this that <304 said—If ye will <1159 ye <134
be <16899 and if ye will not <12643 ye <11 be cast off at the last
day?

22:7 And <107 <2107 him and said unto him: <1124 thou that
<584 is a God? And the king <1821 I know that the <1299 say that
<16 is a God, and I have <516 unto them that they <586 build
<1188 that they may <592 <592 <1187 to <1187 him.
And if now thou <17048 <31 is a God, <1300 I will believe.

22:8 And now when <73 <2326 <2903 his <4340 <749 to <22370 and he
<66 <136 <8306 as thou <4392 O <297 <34 is a God.

22:9 And the king <19 Is God that <3507 <163 that <773 our
<1161 out of the land of Jerusalem?

22:10 And <52 said unto him: Yea, he is that <26 <3629 and he
<5507 all <520 both in <5665 and in <2008 <140 thou <4615

22:11 And he <53 Yea, I <1216 that the <29 <55 <26 all
<945 and I <299 that ye <134 tell me <233 all <1142
<13 and I will <25 thy <5223

22:12 And it came to pass that when <73 saw that the king <797
<21 his <1131 he <131 from the <5488 of <5488 reading the
<1240 unto the king—how God <59 man <538 his own image, and
that God gave him <14842 and that <384 of <18963 man
had fallen.

22:13 And <52 did <1217 unto him the <38 from the <47
of <48 <19094 the fall of man <506 him, and <703 <38192 <14907 and
also the plan of <5384 <327 was <5384 from the <5384 of
the <5570 <1283 <1277 for all <10706 <93 <92 on his <3250

22:14 And <23417 man had <1861 he <998 not merit <7442 of <28772
but the <1307 and <1311 of <10890 atone for <56 <975 <38
<4733 and <13084 and so <12654 and that he breaketh the <8071 of
<9408 that the grave <363 have no victory, and that the sting of
<37 <187 be swallowed up in the <24854 of <12423 and <120 did
<121 all <197 <236 unto the <4077

22:15 And it came to pass that <165 <21 had <5441 <19 <19
unto him, the king <245 What <54 I do that I may have this <13200
life of <134 thou hast spoken? Yea, what <18 I do that I may be born
of God, <4437 this <17046 <9209 rooted out of my breast, and <9612
his <311 that I may be <3693 with joy, that I may not be cast off
at the last day? <380 said he, I will give up all that I <23482
yea, I will forsake my <2259 that I may <44 this <1869 joy.

22:16 But <104 said unto him: If thou <6203 this <12548 if thou
wilt bow down <242 God, yea, if thou wilt <543 of all thy <192 and
will bow down <16 God, and call on his name in <13923 believing that
ye <118 receive, then <2758 thou <58 the hope <132 thou desirest.

22:17 And it came to pass that when <66 had said <170 <358 the
king did bow down <46 the <1283 upon his knees; yea, even he did
<4453 <823 upon the <4453 and <3874 <11755 <1817

22:18 O God, <37 hath told me that <511 is a God; and if <6 is a
God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make <38969 <4535 unto me, and I
will give away all my sins to know <2837 and that I may be <2656 from
the <1653 and be <3923 at the last day. And now when the king had said
<99 <99 he was <11650 as if he were <4314

22:19 And it came to pass that his <3337 ran and told the <4005 all
that had <4637 unto the <318 And she came in unto the <7347 and
when she saw him lay as if he were <69 and also <121 and his
<947 <14715 as <4585 they had been the <856 of his <15854 she
was <1695 with <1274 and <3086 that her <6895 or the <64
of the <661 <393 take them and slay <2430

22:20 Now the <17 had seen the <38 of the <1019 <39 <1633
they <4338 not lay <453 <2329 on <64 and his <1101 and they pled
with the <104 <203 Why commandest thou that we <47 slay <139
men, when <744 one of them is <19249 than us all? <6887 we
<279 fall <248 <63

22:21 Now when the <36 saw the fear of the <70 she also <629 to
fear <2647 lest <235 <45 some evil come upon her. And she
<112 her <21 that they <14 go and call the <1366 that
they <1313 slay <87 and his <1762

22:22 Now when <10 saw the determination of the <4760 he, also
<10744 the <12922 of the <3988 of the <34 <3386 lest that a
<4244 <46 <860 <860 <13156 and <66 <6 be a
<427 <4114 and a disturbance <3906 <1816 <148 he put <1645
his hand and <287 the king from the <348 and said unto him: Stand.
And he <3168 upon his <4234 receiving his <33719

22:23 Now this was done in the <11911 of the <135 and many of the
<1164 And when they saw it they <2680 marveled, and <142 to
fear. And the king <43 <5279 and <10 to minister unto <173 And he
did <7 unto <261 <1669 that his <17456 household were
<4168 unto the <4168

22:24 Now <108 was a <117 <4376 <975 <786 of the
commandment of the <145 and <15 <44 to be <122 <35872 <119
them <18 of <164 and his <174

22:25 But the king <68 <131 <18 them and <4178 unto <68
And they were pacified <2498 <25 and <1857 who were with him.

22:26 And it came to pass that when the king saw that the <1170 were
pacified, he <1657 that <30 and his <379 <192 <7517 <49 in
the <29046 of the <4998 and that they <13 <1518 the word unto
<60

22:27 And it came to pass that the king sent a proclamation <9092
all the <3874 <3533 all his <54 who were in all his <10 who were
in all the <1953 <1619 <10427 <615 was bordering even to the sea, on
the east and on the <31931 and <16 was divided from the land of
<24099 by a narrow strip of <6388 <15 ran from the sea east
even to the sea <28 and <46 <2089 on the <2613 of the seashore,
and the <7 of the <9761 <28 was on the <23936 by the land of
<9817 <903 the <17 of <10144 by the head of the <10910
<10937 <12265 from the east <181 the west—and thus were the
<1946 and the <4720 divided.

22:28 Now, the more idle part of the <16 <35545 in the <84
and <20501 in tents; and they were spread <54 the <68 on the
<88 in the land of <7594 yea, and also on the west of the land of
<78 in the <78 by the <102 and on the west in the land
of <1618 in the <1755 of <550 <2743 <2069 inheritance, and thus
<173 along by the seashore.

22:29 And also <315 were many <79 on the east by the <42
<3853 the <102 had <2879 <242 And thus the <7 were nearly
surrounded by the <4359 <2951 the <10 had <2194
<32625 of all the northern <14470 of the land <54 on the
<119 at the head of the <159 <158 from the east to the <116
<204 <204 on the <126 side; on the <32169 even <2923 they came
to the land <206 they <1523 Bountiful.

22:30 And it bordered upon the land <14 they <14 Desolation, it
<3040 so far northward that it came into the land <16 had been
peopled and been <11023 of <4225 <31981 we have <3164 <14 was
discovered by the <331 of <170 it <34 the <155 of <155
<155 landing.

22:31 And they came from <149 up into the <11179 <10054 Thus the
land on the <59 was <68 <68 and the land on the
southward was <10 Bountiful, it <43 the <112 <56 is <1079
with all <6447 of wild animals of <2232 <34191 a part of <16 had come
from the land <41 for food.

22:32 And now, it was only the distance of a day and a half’s <3002
for a <4093 on the line Bountiful and the land <70 from the
east to the west sea; and thus the land of <10987 and the land of
<416 were <234 <233 by <9170 <111 <85 a <21260 neck of
land <34955 the land <69 and the land southward.

22:33 And it came to pass that the <257 had inhabited the land
<119 even from the east unto the west sea, and thus the <18
in <171 wisdom, with <3 <32601 and <3 <11353 had hemmed in the
<318 on the south, that <8072 they <560 have no more
<299 on the <266 that they <819 not overrun the land
northward.

22:34 <883 the <31 <1390 have no more possessions only in
the land of <387 and the <189 <306 <2175 Now this was <34021
in the Nephites—as the <27 were an enemy to <731 they <1438 not
<1910 <76 <9128 on <203 <4960 and also that they <60 have a
country <393 they <7 <12967 <2190 to <20 desires.

22:35 And now I, <1377 <1336 said <1695 <2094 <2522 to the <2095 of
<1809 and <4632 Omner and Himni, and <27 <739

Alma <2134 23

23:1 <1332 now it came to pass that the king of the <81 sent a
<675 <756 all his <918 that they <143 not lay <37 <1042
on <2048 or <48 or <39313 or <49 nor <19603 of <14 <735
who <21 go <737 <2551 the word of God, in <2277 <367 they
<13 be, in any part of <23 <4433

23:2 Yea, he sent a decree <57 <139 that they <21 not lay <18
<56 on them to bind <13 or to cast them into <2623 <2951 <18
they spit upon <13 nor <3765 <3 nor cast them out of <29
<3201 nor scourge <990 <21 <21 they cast <8990 at <18
but that they <10 have free access to <22 <32534 and also <4
<11298 and <4 sanctuaries.

23:3 And thus they <191 go <105 and <832 the word <196 to
<19 <2387 for the king had been <953 unto the <1391 and all
his household; <1049 he sent his <163 <838 the land
unto his <166 that the word of God <43 have no obstruction, but
that it <8 go <51 <23 all the <850 that his <528 <10
be <18027 <1834 the <1578 <2656 of <60 <2656 and
that they <15 be <14 that they were all <2270 and that they
<6721 not to <35221 nor to plunder, nor to <35243 nor to <34431
<11151 nor to <5 any <519 of wickedness.

23:4 And now it came to pass that when the king had sent <73 this
proclamation, that <977 and his <242 went <10 from city to <3465
and from one <2379 of <2042 to <10130 establishing churches, and
consecrating <11236 and <12523 <104 the land <236 the
<3531 to <162 and to <2195 the word of God <13 <209 and thus
they <1091 to have <1091 success.

23:5 And <31721 were <2027 to the <2799 of the <178 yea,
<11 were <11 to <1853 in the <140 of the <36460
and they were <10926 the <7302 and <39575 <623 were <38558 down
even to the <7299 <7298

23:6 And as sure as the Lord <21434 so sure as many as <5354 or as
many as were <51 to the <62 of the <10644 <920 the
<366 of <433 and his <186 <263 to the <1783 of
<24086 and of <11001 and the <6153 of God working miracles in
them—yea, I say unto you, as the Lord <56 as many of the <439
as <3087 in <237 <22742 and were <294 unto the <116 <6266
did fall <23316

23:7 For they <5283 a <3426 <3813 they did lay down the <32929
of <31 rebellion, that they did not fight <9017 God any <40655
<383 <6 any of <16 <514

23:8 Now, <1504 are they who were <55 unto the Lord:

23:9 The <315 of the <76 who were in the land of <2602

23:10 And also of the <19 of the <19 who were in the land of
<3845

23:11 And also of the <20 of the <20 who were in the city of
<1073

23:12 And also of the <20 of the <20 who were in the land of
Shilom, and who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the city of <7566
and in the city of Shimnilom.

23:13 And <111 are the <20324 of the cities of the <44 <261 were
<119 unto the <9558 and <18 are they that laid down the <162
of <146 <162 yea, all <4 <8 of war; and they were all
<5846

23:14 And the <2442 were not converted, save only one; <177
were any of the Amulonites; but they did <3345 <34 <3344 and also
the <1594 of the <66 in that part of the land wheresoever they
dwelt, yea, and all <23 villages and all <4 cities.

23:15 <3450 we have named all the <99 of the <33 in <100
they did <2015 and come to the <334 of the <334 and were
converted.

23:16 And now it came to pass that the king and <1487 who were
<132 were <4240 that they <546 have a <15416 that <898 they
<8 be <32873 from <69 <1794 <610 the king
consulted with <511 and many of <12 <13729 <583 the name
that they <676 take upon <684 that they <30 be distinguished.

23:17 And it came to pass that they <1098 <29 <201
Anti-Nephi-Lehies; and they were <8 by this name and were no more
<9 <179

23:18 And they <519 to be a very industrious <376 yea, and they
were <39832 with the <503 <6660 they did open a
correspondence with <66 and the <10791 of God did no more <9968 <1314

Alma <892 24

24:1 And it came to pass that the <231 and the <3972 and the
<178 who were in the land of Amulon, and also in the land of
<41127 and who were in the land of <4039 and in <16730 in all the
land <1019 <1575 who had not been <179 and had not <1365 upon
them the name of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, were stirred up by the <62 and
by the <64 to <21292 <470 <147 <468

24:2 And <7 <39974 <505 <4374 sore <13 <112 even
<1781 that they <142 to <23061 <10 <16 <2039 <9 that
they <1062 not that he <201 be <12 <2099 <144 they took up
arms <21 the <433 of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

24:3 Now the king <37215 the <4587 upon his son, and he <194 his
name <20

24:4 And the king died in that <5941 year that the <146 <64
to make preparations for war <47 the <47 of God.

24:5 Now when <657 and his <792 and all <316 who had come up with
him saw the <30 of the <38 to <4715 <88 <677
they came <814 to the land of Midian, and <1294 <35 met all his
<328 and from <25296 they came to the land of Ishmael that they
<317 hold a council with <3255 and also with his <3065
<182 what they <137 do to <8862 <2034 <85 the
<308

24:6 Now <49 was not one soul <837 all the <100 who had been
<223 unto the Lord that <173 take up arms <31 <84 <67
nay, they <10 not even make any <100 for war; yea, and also
<17 king <2139 them that they <60 not.

24:7 Now, <569 are the <3143 <481 he said unto the <54 <421
the matter: I thank my God, my <23029 <1042 that our <899 God has
in <17575 sent <30 our <145 the <5449 unto us to <931
unto us, and to <3699 us of the <899 of our <1043 <38723

24:8 And <4838 I <45 my <39 God that he has <11086 us a <8399 of
his <2915 to soften our <598 that we have <19429 a <422
with <57 <56 the <7489

24:9 And <38 I also <39 my God, that by opening this
<23 we have been <1092 of our <2598 and of the many
murders <117 we have <36674

24:10 And I also <33 my God, yea, my <75 God, that he hath <3112
unto us that we <230 <622 of <64 <2976 and also that he hath
forgiven us of <292 our many sins and <47 <47 we have <38791
and <433 away the <30600 from our <102 <979 the merits of his
Son.

24:11 And now <98 my <108 <2895 it has been all that we <1507
do, (as we were the most lost of all mankind) to <68 of all our sins
and the many <59 <59 we have <59 and to get God to take
them away from our <62 for it was all we <44 do to <34
<4622 <2438 God that he <283 take away our stain—

24:12 Now, my best <251 <75 <75 God hath <101 away our
stains, and our swords have <14054 bright, then let us stain our <9
no more with the <5447 of our <536

24:13 <1512 I say unto you, Nay, let us <5082 our <24 that they
be not <30537 with the <27 of our <356 for perhaps, if we
<340 <45 our <21 <1569 they can no more be <17025 <19993 <164
the <24 of the Son of our <217 God, <129 <2543 be shed for the
<4349 of our <13682

24:14 And the <19 God has had <6643 on us, and made <231 <2992
<2766 unto us that we <242 not <17095 yea, and he has made <16
<17 <16 unto us beforehand, <2367 he loveth our <28232 as well as
he <8 our <17651 <618 in his <44 he doth <11836 us by his
<16384 that the plan of <11771 <45 be made <37 unto us as well
as unto future generations.

24:15 Oh, how <18966 is our God! And now <266 <189 it has been as
much as we <222 do to get our stains <201 away from us, and our
<147 are made <201 let us hide them away that they may be kept
<12 as a <10321 to our God at the last day, or at the day that
we <159 be <1323 to <2420 <267 him to be <37497 that we have not
<210 our <50 in the <188 of our <672 <79 he <11523 his
word unto us and has made us <30918 thereby.

24:16 And now, my <290 if our <25 seek to <682 us, <109
we will hide away our <12161 yea, even we will bury them deep in the
<2656 that they may be kept <95 as a <95 that we have <1344
used <827 at the last day; and if our <47 <45 us, <45 we
<101 go to our God and <6 be <5803

24:17 And now it came to pass that when the king had made an end of
<248 sayings, and all the <642 were <35775 <2750 they took
<671 <83 and all the <1217 <308 were used for the <38171 of
<32188 blood, and they did bury them up deep in the <3541 Alma 24:18
And this they did, it <2087 in <36 view a <101 to God, and also
to men, that they <107 <450 use <47 <374 for the <45 of
<45 <5809 and this they did, vouching and covenanting with God, that
<11734 than shed the <198 of <42 <126 they <31 give up <6
own lives; and <17 than take away from a <825 they <16 give
unto him; and <14 than spend <22 days in idleness they <14 <11922
abundantly with <10 <11920

24:19 And thus we see <27317 when <140 <904 were <271 to
<1646 and to know the <1262 they were firm, and <33 <2070 even
unto <3452 <47 than <1764 sin; and thus we see that they <34466
<46 <111 of <17167 or they <8 the <7 of war, for peace.

24:20 And it came to pass that <23 <283 the <1741 made
<869 for war, and came up to the land of <2267 for the <8728
of destroying the <1080 and to <2024 <3967 in his <40019 and also of
<14 the <230 of Anti-Nephi-Lehi out of the <2031

24:21 Now when the <14 saw that they were <4920 <932 them they
went out to meet <306 and prostrated <975 <392 them to the
<331 and <1074 to call on the name of the <1499 and thus they were in
this attitude when the <152 <20 to fall upon <35 and <6 to
slay them with the <6305

24:22 And thus <13286 meeting any resistance, they did slay a <33219
and five of <1857 and we know that they are <23166 for they have gone
to <11758 with <146 God.

24:23 Now when the <59 saw that <12 <265 <201 not flee
from the <6024 <1542 <8 they turn <27724 to the <27393 hand or to
the <27405 but that they <16 lie down and perish, and praised God even
in the very act of perishing <4462 the sword—

24:24 Now when the <55 saw this they did forbear from <10530
<89 and <1117 were many <2605 <1583 had <8335 in them for <912 of
<76 <76 who had <3776 <39 the <75 for they <6286 of the
<691 <428 they had <10907

24:25 And it came to pass that they threw down <32 <282 of war,
and they <89 not take them <6292 for they were stung for the <901
<37 they had committed; and they came down even as <30 <296
relying upon the mercies of <73 <81 arms were <7730 to slay <1480

24:26 And it came to pass that the <271 of God were <33483 that day
by more than the <5002 who had been <13625 and <37 who had been
<7878 were <1922 <1172 <1616 we have no reason to doubt but
what they were <580

24:27 And <147 was not a <1164 man <28 <1266 <157 but <10 were
more than a <259 <439 to the <1699 of the <4894 thus we see
that the Lord worketh in many ways to the <814 of his <8164

24:28 Now the greatest <81 of <77 of the <211 who slew so
many of <132 <194 were <1520 and Amulonites, the <20
<21 of whom were <2521 the <5558 of the <5558

24:29 Now, <77 <35 who <128 the <134 of the <2048 <83 were
none who were <36 or <36 or who were of the <32 of
<13768 but they were actual descendants of <9496 and Lemuel.

24:30 And thus we can <16914 discern, that <58 a <44 have been
once enlightened by the <1278 of God, and have had <985 <128 of
<271 <4746 to <30685 and then have <288 away into sin
and <4139 they <1093 more <5747 and thus <111 <4114
becomes worse than <3666 they had <684 <954 <607 <4925

Alma <1720 25

25:1 And <792 now it came to pass that <117 <150 were more
<3684 <1014 they had <205 <41 <1097 <232 they swore
<6566 upon the <1777 and they did no more <29041 to slay the
<99 of <562 at that <2277

25:2 But they took <33 <14117 and went over into the <3155 of the
land of <2994 and fell upon the <31 who were in the land of
<14422 and <7883 <331

25:3 And <149 <708 they had many battles with the <1465 in the
<374 they were <3147 and <10939

25:4 And <219 the <102 who were <97 were almost all the seed of
<5917 and his <390 who were the <2438 of <14467 and they were
<22 by the <2669 of the <115

25:5 And the remainder, <2791 fled into the east <3169 and
<8 usurped the <2343 and <13333 over the <725 <3479 that
many of the <62 <1246 perish by fire <164 of <129 belief—

25:6 For many of <650 <104 <33 <5381 much loss and so many
<12968 <659 to be <1858 up in <32012 of the <1611 <112
<2034 and his <348 had <13602 to them in <41 <6266 <203
they <26 to disbelieve the <1587 of <11 <2626 and to
<850 in the <342 and that he gave <292 <85 unto the <107
and thus <354 were many of them <1703 in the <3168

25:7 And it came to pass that <264 <36447 who were the <36135 of the
<7085 of <161 <117 that they <113 be put to <4355 yea, all
<23 that <2456 in <311 <311

25:8 Now this martyrdom <24 that many of <80 <98 <27 be
<114 up to <26412 and <69 <97 to be <3819 in the
<14381 and the <160 <11 to hunt the seed of <57 and his
<31 and <12 to slay <535 and they fled into the east
<96

25:9 And <3966 they are hunted at this day by the <1836 Thus the
<167 of Abinadi were <557 to <14756 <173 he said <1781 the
seed of the <263 who <86 that he <83 <1000 <997 by <16963

25:10 For he said unto <4885 What ye <1195 do unto me <4 be a type
of <466 to <5867

25:11 And now <54 was the <3357 that <245 <39 by fire <263
of his belief in God; now this is what he meant, that many <59
<60 <21 by <17001 <2656 as he had <5603

25:12 And he said unto the <84 of Noah that <168 seed <26 <4123
many to be put to <199 in the like <2851 as he was, and that they
<20 be <8650 <18064 and <8545 even as a <30194 <321 no
<30141 is <416 and <383 by wild beasts; and now <524 <227
<152 were verified, for they were <17 by the <371 and they
were hunted, and they were smitten.

25:13 And it came to pass that when the <226 saw that they <1498
not overpower the <3324 they <5600 <1265 to <93 own <353 and
many of them came over to <1002 in the land of <2080 and the land of
<3292 and did join <1092 to the <533 of God, who were the
<7 of <2186

25:14 And they did also bury <48 <917 of war, <163 as <6
<285 had, and they <287 to be a <851 <2397 and they did
walk in the ways of the <409 and did <30207 to keep his <5415
and his statutes.

25:15 Yea, and they did keep the law of Moses; for it was <7251
that they <179 keep the law of Moses as yet, for it was not all
<30392 But <10948 the law of Moses, they did look <18574
to the <1214 of <4828 <11218 that the law of <31 was a type
of his <18078 and <4600 that they must keep <436 outward
performances <3724 the time that he <59 be <31213 unto <664

25:16 Now they did not <31324 that <912 came by the law of <88
but the law of <50 did <5766 to <36288 <145 <4851 in <25240 and
thus they did <1873 a hope <1844 <4660 unto <4785 salvation,
<1053 upon the <2984 of <2980 <413 <17918 of <68 <377 to
<378

25:17 And now <285 <3394 and <3394 and <3394 and <3394 and <47
<192 did <5768 <4391 for the <13967 <32 they had had
<724 the <298 <8445 that the Lord had <2104 unto them
<220 to <28 <25817 and that he had also <26207 his word unto
them in <3529 particular.

Alma <873 26

26:1 And now, <349 are the <350 of <2386 to his <758 <56 say
thus: My brothers and my <9 <530 I say unto you, how <654
<1109 have we to <27596 for <344 we have <11808 when we started
from the land of <3726 that God <1211 have <83 unto us such
<30 blessings?

26:2 And now, I ask, what <11 <14311 has he bestowed upon us? Can
ye tell?

26:3 <2055 I <17026 for you; for our <70 the <129 were in
darkness, yea, even in the <43166 abyss, but <166 how many of them
are <603 to <92 the <10005 <9980 of God! And this is the
<24584 <113 hath been <56 upon us, that we have been made
<42808 in the <873 of God to <12763 <4015 this <79 work.

26:4 <70 <3289 of them do <5359 and have been <51 into
the fold of God.

26:5 <20 the field was ripe, and <8725 are ye, for ye did thrust
in the sickle, and did reap with your <9538 yea, all the day long did
ye labor; and <93 the <1205 of your sheaves! And they <669 be
<4476 into the garners, that they are not wasted.

26:6 Yea, they <18 not be beaten down by the storm at the last day;
yea, <1513 <15 they be <17912 up by the whirlwinds; but when the
<20 <21007 they <15 be <47 <4523 in <292 <7054 that the
<13 <12143 penetrate to <799 yea, <32 <17 they be <620 with
<24094 winds <6287 the <3840 <35087 to <13462 <421

26:7 But <195 they are in the <164 of the Lord of the harvest, and
they are his; and he will <8907 them up at the last day.

26:8 <9933 be the name of our God; let us sing to his praise, yea,
let us give <27557 to his holy <3063 for he doth work <19341
<19176

26:9 For if we had not come up out of the land of <1184 <374 our
dearly <2388 <292 who have so <6 <6 us, <339 <7026
have been <43444 with <2902 <1773 us, yea, and they <13 also have
been strangers to God.

26:10 And it came to pass that when <413 had said <47 <5042 his
<1952 <1089 <9188 him, <4919 <494 I fear that thy joy doth
<149 thee away unto boasting.

26:11 But <30 said unto him: I do not boast in my own <37375 nor
in my own wisdom; but <171 my joy is full, yea, my <5681 is brim
with joy, and I will <535 in my God.

26:12 Yea, I know that I am <17538 as to my <8575 I am weak;
<1158 I will not <55 of <10473 but I will <6 of my God, for
in his <23 I can do all <11590 yea, <64 many <10573 <3587
we have <7759 in this <3823 for <421 we will praise his name
<194

26:13 <385 how many <407 of our <615 has he <16919 from the
<17995 of hell; and they are <415 to sing <32881 <32881 and this
<1016 of the <1214 of his word <46 is in us, <87 have we not
<454 <573 to rejoice?

26:14 Yea, we have <10 to <65 him <19693 for he is the Most
High God, and has <60 our <65 from the <18643 of <18275

26:15 Yea, they were <18289 <498 with <10506 <10517 and
<24531 but <117 he has <77 them into his <13
light, yea, into <5 salvation; and they are <26 <26
with the <27124 bounty of his love; yea, and we have been
<547 in his <383 of doing this <90 and <578 <546

26:16 <3464 let us <21529 yea, we will <10602 in the <2058 yea, we
will <556 for our joy is full; yea, we will <109 our God <173
<170 who can <25 too much in the <6069 Yea, who can say too much
of his <55 <9555 and of his <26188 and of his <14398 <4788
the <1350 of men? <34 I say unto you, I <495 say the smallest
part <182 I feel.

26:17 Who <747 have <746 that our God <386 have been so <2615
as to have snatched us from our <21728 sinful, and polluted state?

26:18 <48 we went <3199 even in wrath, with <282 threatenings to
<2487 his <31084

26:19 Oh then, why did he not consign us to an <9389 <15297 yea,
why did he not let the <8369 of his <20686 fall upon us, and doom us
to <946 despair?

26:20 Oh, my <10723 <1626 as it <37320 <17120 at the thought. <68 he
did not <18183 his <33 upon us, but in his <145 <2748 hath
<241 us over that <236 gulf of <1315 and <35735 even to the
<1026 of our <14523

26:21 And now <268 my <539 what <10767 man is <1476 that
<30067 <506 <11872 I say unto you, <10 is none that <11 <11
<3068 save it be the penitent.

26:22 Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth <1046 and <21726 <149
good <21759 and prayeth continually <2286 ceasing—unto such it is
<3185 to know the <22051 of God; yea, unto such it <707 be <13 to
reveal <1064 <219 <1880 have been revealed; yea, and it <15 be
<16 unto such to <864 <448 of <2879 to <5961 even as it
has been <16 unto us to <16 <84 our <398 to <14400

26:23 Now do ye <27300 my <118 that we said unto our <18
in the land of <675 we go up to the land of <1336 to <3300 unto
our <26 the <975 and they laughed us to scorn?

26:24 For they said unto us: Do ye <1204 that ye can <65 the
<1405 to the <2013 of the <24762 Do ye <16 that ye can
<3339 the <16 of the <27184 of the <1756 of <849
<1757 as <7941 a <1385 as they are; <2255 <2336 delight in
the <2695 of <2693 <9 days have been spent in the grossest
<33036 <10 ways have been the ways of a transgressor from the
beginning? Now my <95 ye <12656 that this was <50 language.

26:25 And moreover they did say: Let us take up arms <785 <1866 that
we <365 them and <24 <19888 out of the <651 lest they <4790
us and <15 us.

26:26 But <290 my <824 <52 we came into the <4783 not
with the <7678 to <22 our <14 but with the <8 that
<8640 we <3077 save some few of <50 <329

26:27 Now when our <122 were depressed, and we were <586 to turn
back, <51 the Lord comforted us, and <6146 Go <5406 thy <44
the <206 and bear with <29778 <8740 <1952 and I will
give unto you <4439

26:28 And now <34 we have <7639 and been <338 <33 <1026 and we
have been <8161 in our sufferings, and we have <1750 <1327
privation; yea, we have <29320 from <4515 to <8118 <1409 upon the
<2463 of the world—not upon the <6 of the <20595 alone but upon
the <9 of God.

26:29 And we have <7894 into <118 <29661 and <4481 <179 and we
have <6 them in <12 streets; yea, and we have <9 them upon
<10 hills; and we have also <30 into <8 temples and <3
<7244 and <19 <94 and we have been cast out, and mocked, and
spit <25460 and <8746 upon our cheeks; and we have been <17579 and
<3222 and <8187 with <8041 <8187 and cast into <4821 and <1520
the <847 and <4997 of God we have been <6941 <32575

26:30 And we have <137 all <1832 of <177 and all <4970
that <229 we <229 be the <43478 of saving some <33037 and we <690
that our joy <691 be full if <21 we <703 be the <21 of <21
some.

26:31 Now <204 we can look <202 and see the fruits of our <39607
and are they few? I say unto you, Nay, they are <17196 yea, and we can
<11264 of <139 sincerity, <947 of <4 love <780 <3
<494 and also <6 us.

26:32 For <51 they had <3021 sacrifice <17 <26391 than even to
take the life of <10 enemy; and they have <3020 <6 <1821 of war
deep in the <2937 <47 of <11 love <41 <3 <3562

26:33 And now <1386 I say unto you, has <662 been so <710 love in
all the <27907 <730 I say unto you, Nay, <16 has not, even <1657
the <3808

26:34 For <78 they <150 take up arms <451 <50 <2488 they
<9 not <2054 <1914 to be <2413 But <54 how many of <625
have laid down <21 <3188 and we know that they have gone to <10
God, <89 of <5 love and of <4 <1279 to sin.

26:35 Now have we not <1074 to <1084 Yea, I say unto you, <80
<702 were men that had so <101 <17 to <1219 as we, <3445 the
<371 began; yea, and my joy is <11557 away, even unto boasting in my
God; for he has all <984 all <5357 and all understanding; he
comprehendeth all <798 and he is a <954 Being, even unto
<1835 to <1826 who will <3782 and <2393 on his <6742

26:36 Now if this is boasting, even so will I boast; for this is my
life and my <1124 my joy and my <38 and my <8071 from
<896 wo. Yea, <1619 is the name of my God, who has been
mindful of this <2897 who are a <16259 of the tree of Israel, and has
been lost from its body in a <20216 <2130 yea, I say, <39 be the
name of my God, who has been <39 of us, <20239 in a <22
<3246

26:37 Now my <593 we see that God is <21 of <555 <60
<5306 land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his <12 and his
<31062 of <998 are over all the <3489 Now this is my joy, and my
<202 thanksgiving; yea, and I will give <1563 unto my God <1189
<20956

Alma <1927 27

27:1 Now it came to pass that when <182 <828 who had gone to war
<310 the <2249 had <37912 <2630 <275 many struggles to <729
<593 that it was in vain to seek <14 <1124 they <2268
<2269 to the land of <16196

27:2 And it came to pass that the <7963 <318 of <25 loss,
were <4496 angry. And when they saw that they <515 not seek
revenge from the <2785 they <2248 to stir up the <892 in <4532
<75 <31 <157 the <8 of Anti-Nephi-Lehi; <1429 they
<19 <61 to <78 <1739

27:3 Now this <17 <11 <15943 to take <25 arms, and they
<597 <409 to be <2406 <2081 to the <9219 of <15
<36974

27:4 Now when <1617 and his <532 saw this work of <14475 <459
<144 whom they so <1697 <27358 and <9 <8 who had so <8
<882 them—for they were treated as <2988 they were <8593 sent from
God to save them from <316 destruction—therefore, when <46 and
his <47 saw this <217 work of <160 they were moved with
compassion, and they said unto the <7520

27:5 Let us <14695 <1879 this <107 of the <2372 and let us go down
to the land of <2113 to our <45 the <158 and flee out of
the <1485 of our <28655 that we be not <32631

27:6 But the king said unto <2652 <583 the <248 will <164 us,
<212 of the many <3352 and sins we have <43183 <190 <177

27:7 And <101 <950 I will go and <16546 of the <75 and if he say
unto us, go down unto our <216 will ye go?

27:8 And the king said unto him: Yea, if the Lord <22759 unto us go, we
will go down unto our <29 and we will be <211 slaves <2409 we
<44995 unto them the many <78 and sins <1290 we have <79
<80 <80

27:9 But <80 said unto him: It is <13 the law of our <41
<25 was <10521 by my <12824 that <621 <2448 be any <48
<235 <926 <298 let us go down and rely upon the <986 of our
<751

27:10 But the king said unto him: Inquire of the <126 and if he <100
unto us go, we will go; <9512 we will <3062 in the <512

<46347 And it came to pass that <84 went and <14026 of the <35 and
the Lord said unto him:

<46311 Get this <253 out of this <1208 that they <41 not; for <26115
has <291 hold on the <1167 of the <434 who do stir up the
<490 to <412 <128 <160 <268 to slay <112 <112 get
thee out of this <609 and <607 are this <48 in this <25580
for I will <14286 <167

<46348 And now it came to pass that <89 went and told the king all the
<2471 <170 the Lord had said unto him.

<46324 And they <2227 <348 all <64 <611 yea, all the <52
of the <118 and did <363 <15 all <15 <11493 and <30805 and
<8106 out of the <116 and came into the <1307 <47 <6627
the land of <3949 from the land of <1485 and came over near the
<3357 of the <178

<46299 And it came to pass that <89 said unto <370 <370 I and my
<135 will go <1067 into the land of <38 and ye <1576 <11659
here <309 we return; and we will try the <173 of our <286
<22499 they will that ye <22 come into <93 <57

<46316 And it came to pass that as <58 was <10313 <49 into the <102
that he and his <61 met <20537 over in the <4040 of <110 has been
<20331 and <1014 this was a <20944 meeting.

<46271 Now the joy of <40 was so <246 even that he was <1944 yea, he
was <7587 up in the joy of his God, even to the exhausting of his
<14586 and he fell <647 to the <795

<46289 Now was not this <12396 joy? <140 this is joy <70 none
<20051 save it be the truly penitent and <18214 seeker of happiness.

<46239 Now the joy of Alma in <4046 his <105 was <21 <16233 and
also the joy of <2801 of <2801 and <45508 but <1102 <147 joy was
not that to <36964 <8 <7089

<46216 And now it came to pass that Alma conducted his <41 back to
the land of <37498 even to his own <27285 And they went and told
the <16078 <19440 all the <1805 that had <7387 unto them in the land
of <1749 <488 <53 <219 the <3313

<46239 And it came to pass that the <32 <32 sent a <6135
<6009 all the <213 <18831 the <11011 of the <341 <3327
the admitting <35 <35 who were the <10 of <3113

<46242 And it came to pass that the <27 of the <17 <11501 <2437
<170 we will give up the land of Jershon, <175 is on the east by
the sea, <9 joins the land <6533 <5 is on the <6678 of the
land Bountiful; and this land Jershon is the land <17 we will give
unto our <145 for an <8804

<46240 And <286 we will set our <3752 <6598 the land <29 and
the land <133 that we may protect our <29 in the land Jershon;
and this we do for our <113 on <6467 of <118 fear to take up
arms <541 <8 <25 lest they <659 <4443 sin; and this <9
<324 fear came <787 of <7 sore <17641 <79 they had, on
<34 of <10 many <719 and <4 <2163 <6230

<46271 And now <83 this will we do unto our <58 that they may
<25220 the land <74 and we will <14032 them from <31 <14960
with our <6655 on condition that they will give us a <5253 of <16
<33818 to assist us that we may maintain our armies.

<46299 Now, it came to pass that when <416 had <8280 <1615 he <1110
to the <213 of <5429 and also Alma with him, into the
<3808 <9062 they had pitched <48 <39589 and made <3985 unto
them all <1455 <3678 And Alma also <19255 unto them his conversion,
with <46 and <377 and his <786

<46304 And it came to pass that it did <3524 <154 joy <329 <683 And
they went down into the land of <270 and took <6752 of the
land of <133 and they were <5613 by the <972 the <87 of
<8583 <736 they were <5878 by that name ever after.

<46336 And they were <49 the <22 of <250 and also <33394 <8
the <9 who were of the <11412 of God. And they were also
<37 for <117 zeal <1632 God, and also <4 men; for
they were perfectly honest and upright in all <2699 and they were
firm in the <3338 of <3402 even unto the end.

<46371 And they did look upon <2123 the <4800 of <46 <288 with
the <4263 <22180 and they <1572 <1269 be prevailed upon to take
up arms <308 <20 <1645 and they <15 did look upon <2385 with
any degree of terror, for <16 hope and views of <8257 and the
<17604 <5164 <19 was <640 up to them by the <17582
of <17 over it.

<46408 <2625 they <1688 <1687 <22 in the most aggravating and
distressing <1882 <347 <69 be inflicted by <47 <326 <4708
they <21 take the <2501 or cimeter to <6736 <216

<46390 And thus they were a <9001 and <1274 <873 a <21748 <29240
<175 of the <7645

Alma <1459 28

28:1 And now it came to pass that <1446 the <23 of <281 were
<1091 in the land of <257 and a <206 also <10 in
the land of <11 and the <488 of the <258 were set <5972
<2173 the land of <15 yea, in all the <894 <12 <11 the land
of <664 <697 the <27 of the <1024 had <40063 <111
<195 into the <3973

28:2 And thus <1150 was a tremendous battle; yea, even such an one as
<194 had been <380 <286 all the <88 in the land from the time
Lehi left <26657 yea, and tens of <2490 of the <52 were
<1452 and <3875 abroad.

28:3 Yea, and also <51 was a <51 slaughter <40 the <39 of
<6437 <11018 the <27 were <3249 and scattered, and the
<14 of <1008 <464 <854 to <90 <941

28:4 And now this was a time that <40 was a <423 <13048 and
lamentation <491 <734 all the <734 <48 all the <35 of
Nephi—

28:5 Yea, the cry of widows <25 for <44 husbands, and also of
<8761 <9 for <9 <11417 and the daughter for the <35697 yea,
the <3179 for the <9380 and thus the cry of <22 was <54
<51 all of <1668 <8 for <30 <28093 who had been <1987

28:6 And now <15119 this was a sorrowful day; yea, a time of solemnity,
and a time of much <33767 and prayer.

28:7 And thus <38174 the fifteenth year of the <9363 of the <17901 over
the <105 of <153

28:8 And this is the <693 of <292 and his <350 <68
<14179 in the land of <510 <8 <8664 in the <138 <5
sorrows, and <4 <2256 and <3 incomprehensible joy, and the
reception and safety of the <270 in the land of Jershon. And now
may the <1233 the <33192 of all men, <9692 <29 <2733 <1830

28:9 And this is the <66 of the wars and <19088 <140 the
<1598 and also the wars <835 the <347 and the <7679 and
the <111 year of the <111 of the <111 is ended.

<45952 And from the <4231 year to the <21 has <2905 to pass the
<1729 of many <4858 <2153 yea, it has <13 to pass an
<816 <13036 of bloodshed.

<45957 And the <18612 of many <332 are laid low in the <2259 <12489
the <13 of many <13 are moldering in heaps upon the face of
the <14633 yea, and many <15 are <237 for the loss of <123
<28617 <884 they have <2169 to <20135 <1821 to the <17262 of
the <146 that they are <30302 to a <4783 of <24156 wo.

<45948 While many <40 of <12660 <1168 <45721 for the loss of <42
<42 yet they <2208 and exult in the <32363 and even <11995
<48 to the <48 of the <47 that they are <8284 to <4223 at
the <5199 hand of God, in a <56 of never-ending <1229

<45971 And thus we see how <399 the <18491 of man is <95 of sin
and <4871 and the <2537 of the <18240 <639 <24297 by the
<11645 <28093 <7 he hath devised to ensnare the <1401 of men.

<45988 And thus we see the <44 call of <25134 of men to <5516 in
the vineyards of the <3307 and thus we see the <20 <151 of <31621
and also of rejoicing—sorrow <67 of <705 and <230 <276
men, and joy <10 of the <3928 of <729 unto <11170

Alma <672 29

29:1 O that I were an <28703 and <728 have the wish of mine <22249
that I <2612 go <1460 and <14976 with the trump of God, with a <1224 to
<47625 the <256 and cry <1107 unto <2227 <12639

29:2 Yea, I <759 <9909 unto <11 <3241 as with the <26 of
<47672 <22 and the plan of <9124 that they <1151 <2371
and come unto our God, that <579 <60 not be more <33761 upon all the
face of the <1458

29:3 But <1144 I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I <7415 to be
content with the <1377 <192 the Lord hath allotted unto me.

29:4 I <20 not to <20245 up in my <7519 the firm <7609 of a just
God, for I know that he granteth unto men <288 to <305 <11423
<1622 it be unto <187 or unto <12371 yea, I know that he allotteth
unto men, yea, decreeth unto them decrees <63 are unalterable,
<31 to <31 wills, <30 they be unto <3341 or unto
<22792

29:5 Yea, and I know that good and evil have come <925 all men; he
that <3335 not good from evil is blameless; but he that <10 good
and <24160 to him it is <3274 <53 to his <104 <53 he
<15664 good or <16 life or <4690 joy or remorse of conscience.

29:6 Now, <4355 that I know <1218 <2583 why <200 I <9439 more
than to perform the work to <99 I have been called?

29:7 Why <21 I <21 that I were an <290 that I <291 <278 unto
all the ends of the <15101

29:8 For <218 the Lord doth <9840 unto all <47597 of <137 own
nation and <30248 to <7555 his <10030 yea, in <2660 all that he seeth
fit that they <55 have; <1233 we see that the Lord doth counsel
in <21 <120 to that <81 is just and <35870

29:9 I know that <12 the Lord hath <6722 me, and I <3707 in it. I
do not <7 of <3932 but I <5 in that <23 the Lord hath
<24 me; yea, and this is my <3763 that <2984 I may be an
<18096 in the <2304 of God to <3391 some soul to <17826 and
this is my joy.

<45745 And <124 when I see many of my <778 <602 penitent, and
<4671 to the Lord <131 God, then is my soul <8270 with joy; then do
I <3363 what the Lord has done for me, yea, even that he hath <920
my prayer; yea, then do I <21 his <2802 arm <97 he <12795
<1335 me.

<45781 Yea, and I also <18 the <25217 of my <12249 for I
<935 do know that the Lord did <12274 them out of <48252 and by
this did <12875 his <34991 yea, the Lord God, the God of <33005
the God of <33009 and the God of <33012 did <32 them out of
<43534

<45781 Yea, I have <13327 <42841 the <62 of my <62 and
that same God who <3195 them out of the <167 of the Egyptians did
<37 them out of <36

<45779 Yea, and that same God did <74 his <1257 <631 <2234 yea,
and that same God hath <1514 me by a holy <23779 to <3622 the word
unto this <1321 and hath <398 me much success, in the <148 my joy
is <25767

<45744 But I do not joy in my own <4761 <18025 but my joy is more full
<684 of the <12 of my <1038 who have been up to the land of
<2768

<45725 <1875 they have <28116 <4798 and have <940 <676
much fruit; and how <738 <2162 be <251 reward!

<45712 Now, when I <37385 of the <47 of <454 my <276 my soul is
<3066 <3066 even to the separation of it from the <26559 as it <3924
so <40 is my joy.

<45718 And now may God <436 unto these, my <85 that they may sit
down in the <7282 of God; yea, and also all <2745 who are the <23706
of <76 <33028 that they may go no more out, but that they may <4129
him <1110 And may God <47 that it may be done <450 to my
<4444 even as I have <15549 <2958

Alma <827 30

30:1 <140 now it came to pass that <1499 the <1218 of <1207 were
<1489 in the land of <1473 yea, and also <16 the <1382
were <1383 out of the <1212 and <81 dead were <3354 by the <31
of the land—

30:2 Now <16 dead were not <1746 <216 of the <10365 of <10
numbers; <4671 were the dead of the <1185 numbered—but it came to
pass <53 they had <42 <20 <9532 and also <8 the days of
fasting, and mourning, and <19047 (and it was in the sixteenth year of
the <1209 of the <1209 over the <70 of <21685 <864 <2972 to be
<19674 <19673 <1441 all the <1465

30:3 Yea, and the <21 did <5239 to keep the <5239 of the
<1011 and they were <26191 in observing the <23814 of God,
<174 to the law of <5155 for they were <3653 to keep the law of
<5160 <2475 it <656 be <5237

30:4 And thus the <51 did have no <9434 in all the <91
year of the <91 of the <91 over the <19 of <348

30:5 And it came to pass that in the <33251 of the seventeenth
year of the <29 of the <19980 <115 was <112 <6562

30:6 But it came to pass in the latter end of the <28 <20443
<22 came a man into the land of <2570 and he was Anti-Christ,
for he <152 to <471 unto the <70 <1880 the <8276 <463 had
been <12130 by the <15687 <2328 the <663 of <20967

30:7 Now <43 was no law <25 a <6745 <43692 for it was strictly
<27869 to the commands of God that <20 <142 be a law <43 <5
<727 men on to unequal grounds.

30:8 For thus <2865 the scripture: Choose ye this day, whom ye will
serve.

30:9 Now if a man <13440 to <5344 God, it was his privilege; or
rather, if he <5827 in God it was his <24551 to <19 him; but if
he did not <3510 in him <72 was no law to punish him.

30:10 But if he <43747 he was <43747 unto <25592 and if he <12976
he was also <43771 and if he stole he was also <8 and if he
<3026 adultery he was also <10 yea, for all this <11936
they were punished.

30:11 For <61 was a law that men <133 be <26309 <302 to <377
crimes. <11452 <15 was no law <168 a <168 <168
<2051 a man was <72 only for the <29631 <161 he had done;
<966 all men were on <28229 <164

30:12 And this <235 <4239 name was Korihor, (and the law <1034
have no hold upon him) <246 to <246 unto the <246 that <58
<69 be no <237 And <442 this <2078 did he preach, <2549

30:13 O ye that are <4004 down <6624 a <11786 and a vain <1517 why do
ye yoke <22066 with such <13 <4514 Why do ye look for a
Christ? For no man can know of <10427 <96 is to <5533

30:14 <583 <693 <1297 <11 ye call prophecies, <4 ye say are
<8594 down by holy <317 <990 they are <45 <4376 of
your <7719

30:15 How do ye know of <161 <36941 <37 ye <4740 know of <40
<37 ye do not see; <148 ye <12 know that <118 <763 be a
<118

30:16 Ye look <5702 and say that ye see a <24277 of your <7456 But
<62 it is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of
your <19446 <1587 <624 of the <78 of your <4453 <59 lead
you away into a <6006 of <70 <10 are not so.

30:17 And many more such <13 did he say unto <1976 telling them that
<81 <214 be no <7522 made for the sins of men, but <1507 man
fared in this life <282 to the management of the creature;
<113 <16 man <31312 <12 to his genius, and that <9
man conquered <10 to his <2965 and <3776 a man did was
no crime.

30:18 And thus he did <266 unto <69 leading away the <1682 of
<11796 <29726 them to lift up <177 <27558 in <3 <21775 yea,
<19 away many <15016 and also men, to <2720 whoredoms—telling them
that when a man was <738 that was the end <22113

30:19 Now this man went over to the land of <2788 <11042 to <61
<259 <136 <1064 the <330 of <5302 who were once the <7 of the
<2931

30:20 But <2305 they were more wise than many of the <6382 for
they took him, and <339 him, and <985 him <1502 <37 who was a
high <20907 over that <6807

30:21 And it came to pass that he <6271 that he <389 be <29 out
of the <794 And he came over into the land of <34050 and <416 to
<90 unto them also; and here he did not have much <1133 for he
was <4412 and <69 and <39 <67 the high <43936 and also the
<3021 <3021 over the <47

30:22 And it came to pass that the high <85 said unto him: Why do ye
go <2433 <47234 the ways of the <5142 Why do ye <1494 this <144
that <283 <364 be no <2650 to interrupt <210 rejoicings? Why do ye
<1542 <550 all the <744 of the holy prophets?

30:23 Now the high priest’s name was Giddonah. And Korihor said unto
him: <13009 I do not <48 the <443 <365 of your <365 and
<374 I do not <13 this <61 to bind <3898 down <521 the
<21 <919 and <6094 <375 are laid down by ancient
<8653 to usurp <1995 and <6678 over <303 to keep them in
ignorance, that they may not lift up <90 <30077 but be <1235 down
<346 to thy <11089

30:24 Ye say that this <58 is a free <226 <502 I say they are
in <1362 Ye say that <1187 <58 <117 are <1601 <16 I
say that ye do not know that they are <13

30:25 Ye say that this <42 is a <38503 and a <6959 <1363 <114
of the <41711 of a parent. <37 I say that a <28695 is not
<22 <18 of its parents.

30:26 And ye also say that <2038 <197 <622 But <540 I say that ye
do not know that <211 <14 be a <574 And ye say also that he <10
be <2607 for the sins of the world—

30:27 And thus ye lead away this <84 <718 the <179 <200 of
your <201 and <148 to your own desires; and ye keep them <15675
even as it were in <1571 that ye may glut <719 with the <1323
of <182 <14693 that they <10674 not look up with <17067 and that
they <10 not <46378 <17 <43614 and privileges.

30:28 Yea, they <13 not make use of that <242 is <18 own lest they
<410 <13973 <7 <245 who do yoke them <75 to <8
<1920 and have <233 them to believe, by <10 <94 and
<4 dreams and <3 whims and <3 visions and <3 <44753
mysteries, that they should, if they did not do <37 to <14
<1386 <49 some unknown being, who they say is God—a <7850 who <2790
has been seen or <15555 who <8 was nor ever will be.

30:29 Now when the high <426 and the <446 <446 saw the <10685 of
his <2228 yea, when they saw that he <2201 <27768 even <409 God,
they <7 not make any reply to his <14625 but they <531 that he
<122 be <22834 and they <1695 him up into the <1695 of the
officers, and sent him to the land of <1206 that he <2217 be
<135 <519 <3729 and the <69 <69 who was <43341 over all the
<520

30:30 And it came to pass that when he was <28 <28 Alma and the
<29 <22815 he did go on in the same <985 as he did in the land of
<45349 yea, he went on to blaspheme.

30:31 And he did rise up in <1625 swelling <3950 <43 <71 and did
<125 <124 the <6832 and <22854 accusing them of <754 away
the <317 <317 the silly <223 of <199 <316 for the sake of
glutting on the <299 of the <458

30:32 Now Alma said unto him: Thou <12822 that we do not glut
<12905 upon the <24 of this <6723 for <741 I have <1745
even from the <1397 of the <1392 of the <1421 <1450 now, with
mine own <174 for my support, <6691 my many travels <3082
<650 the land to <2419 the word of God unto my <68

30:33 And <23 the many <56 <344 I have performed in the
<21676 I have <278 <18344 so much as even one <29614 for my <6359
<1616 has any of my <1754 save it were in the judgment-seat; and
then we have <28 only <333 to law for our <7418

30:34 And now, if we do not <11337 <1141 for our <62 in the
<58 what doth it profit us to <2606 in the <1952 save it were to
<98 the <8106 that we may have rejoicings in the joy of our
<33103

30:35 Then why <11869 thou that we <832 unto this <206 to get <29492
when <34237 of thyself, <185 that we <64 no gain? And now,
<22522 thou that we <14334 this <624 that causes such joy in
<231 <13137

30:36 And <769 <11971 him, Yea.

30:37 And then Alma said unto him: <11838 thou that <609 is a God?

30:38 And he <17590 Nay.

30:39 Now Alma said unto him: Will ye deny <3190 that <26 is a God,
and also deny the <1289 For <656 I say unto you, I know <18 is a
God, and also that <675 <651 <675

30:40 And now what evidence have ye that <22 is no God, or that
<21 <6521 not? I say unto you that ye have none, save it be your
word only.

30:41 But, <59 I have all <1077 as a <8390 that <1083 <6
are <17429 and ye also have all <9 as a <15 unto you that they
are <16 and will ye deny <37603 <134 thou that <29 <20 are
true?

30:42 <789 I know that thou believest, but thou art <24448 with a
<24534 <34715 and ye have put off the <7796 of God that it may have no
<4247 in you; but the <38623 has <920 over you, and he doth <6452 you
<9441 <9948 <29637 that he may <4707 the <6145 of God.

30:43 And now <223 said unto <24173 If thou wilt show me a sign, that
I may be <9095 that <158 is a God, yea, show unto me that he hath
<5212 and then will I be <20 of the <33572 of thy <961

30:44 But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye <29597
your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a <60 when ye have the <163
of all <151 thy <424 and also all the holy <1092 The
<12028 are laid <578 <11651 yea, and all <169 denote <82 is a
God; yea, even the <2928 and all <13 that are upon the face of it,
yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets <500 move in <363
regular form do <5523 that <40 is a <29696 Creator.

30:45 And yet do ye go <171 <626 away the <1399 of this <398
testifying unto them <26 is no God? And yet will ye deny <654 all
<99 witnesses? And he <4879 Yea, I will deny, <13569 ye <342 show me
a sign.

30:46 And now it came to pass that Alma said unto him: <273 I am
<41470 <1057 of the <835 of your <834 yea, that ye will <6749
resist the <7222 of the <520 that thy soul may be <4972

30:47 But <355 it is <14649 that thy soul <837 be lost than that
thou <14609 be the <5687 of <21187 many <3435 down to <5058
by thy <323 and by thy flattering <870 <1561 if thou <11934 deny
<8355 <708 God <99 <3848 <196 that thou <11 <8107 <50710 that
thou <6 <660 open thy <15670 any <10206 that thou <9 not <549
this <574 any <50263

30:48 Now <321 said unto him: I do not deny the <29886 of a God,
but I do not <1984 that <175 is a God; and I say <1536 that ye do
not know that <15 is a God; and <174 ye show me a <296 I will not
<12500

30:49 Now Alma said unto him: This will I give unto thee for a <23
that thou <85 be <11922 <101 <726 to my <122 and I say, that
in the name of God, ye <124 be <19 <19 that ye <6 no more have
utterance.

30:50 Now when Alma had said <255 <1092 <114 was <23 <23 that
he <1750 not have utterance, <49 to the <935 of <23516

30:51 And now when the <983 <1012 saw <4302 he put <2625 his hand and
wrote unto <1999 <1969 Art thou <441 of the <506 of God? In
whom did ye <3052 that Alma <239 show <27 his sign? <25684 ye that
he <10 <16133 <18623 to show unto thee a <14 <300 he has
showed unto you a sign; and now will ye <44808 more?

30:52 And <95 put <39 his hand and wrote, <63 I know that I
am <106 for I <1940 <24375 and I know that <28504 save it were the
<79 of God <120 <2269 this upon me; yea, and I <2858 knew that
<218 was a God.

30:53 But <338 the <613 hath deceived me; for he <21654 unto me
in the form of an <3159 and said unto me: Go and <41171 this <448
for they have all gone astray <1083 an <1274 God. And he said unto
me: There is no God; yea, and he <2499 me that <507 I <138 say. And
I have <11 his <247 and I <5 them <437 they were pleasing
unto the <12581 <2017 and I <13 <1606 even <1073 I had much <1755
<10074 that I verily <2337 that they were <761 and for this <4462
I <14941 the <456 even <25 I have <1223 this <1184 <10220 upon
me.

30:54 Now when he had said <247 he <23542 that Alma <76 pray unto
God, that the <25 <1283 be <1805 from him.

30:55 But Alma said unto him: If this <17 <25 be <17 from thee
thou <15065 <930 lead away the <594 of this <1179 <2313 it
<341 be unto thee even as the Lord <28320

30:56 And it came to pass that the <40 was not <40 off of Korihor;
but he was cast out, and went <1185 from <6385 to <2 begging for his
<11445

30:57 Now the <6628 of what had <4927 unto <286 was
<23732 published <2728 all the <5295 yea, the <4911
was sent <299 by the <374 <374 to all the <526 in the <2837
<26109 unto <1740 who had <173 in the <403 of <38 that they
must <35181 <13070 lest the same <25081 <1464 come unto <4426

30:58 And it came to pass that they were all <405 of the
<2477 of <103 <610 they were all <8420 <146 unto the
<2784 and this put an end to the <6628 <290 the <1423 of Korihor.
And <60 did go <123 from <121 to <6508 <123 food for his
support.

30:59 And it came to pass that as he went <110 <2124 the <335 yea,
<5 a <110 who had <14594 <1918 from the <2914 and
<3196 <7 Zoramites, <1610 led by a man <2496 name was
Zoram—and as he went <34 <6588 <313 <395 he was run upon and
<42573 <1751 even <297 he was <12513

30:60 And thus we see the end of him who perverteth the ways of the
<113 and thus we see that the <433 will not <47005 his <1032 at
the last day, but doth <172 drag them down to <7315

Alma <3074 31

31:1 Now it came to pass that <146 the end of <584 Alma <8332
<1392 <26345 that the Zoramites were <2107 the ways of the
<4057 and that <23139 who was <946 leader, was <927 the <332 of
the <139 to bow down to dumb <21411 his <7532 <203 <2197 to sicken
<450 of the <199 of the <1488

31:2 For it was the <433 of <423 <3893 to Alma to know of <21
<181 his <375 <242 his <37 was <6056 <4407 <35
of the <3265 of the <79 from the <6439

31:3 Now the <10 had <5578 <197 <5564 in a land <525
they <206 Antionum, <5 was east of the land of <1737 <8
lay <11768 <11982 upon the <12019 <8 was <5200 of the land of
<3199 <9 also <11951 upon the <5586 <11720 <7
<4 was full of the <2375

31:4 Now the <257 <12431 <12510 that the <64 <354 <22565
into a <10307 with the <6867 and that it <12 be the
<973 of <118 loss on the part of the <97

31:5 And now, as the <11238 of the word had a <22 tendency to lead
the <177 to do that <70 was just—yea, it had had more <19180
<2639 upon the <2631 of the <19 than the <9393 or <1601 else,
<23 had <480 unto them—therefore Alma <14669 it was <8409
that they <565 try the virtue of the word of God.

31:6 <11814 he took <2462 and <5117 and Omner; and Himni he did
<22160 in the <1629 in <4805 but the former <17682 he took with
him, and also <22849 and <29816 who were at <36254 and he also took
two of his sons.

31:7 Now the eldest of his sons he took not with him, and his name was
Helaman; but the <10960 of <543 whom he took with him were Shiblon and
Corianton; and <968 are the <17 of <17 who went with him <283 the
<453 to <1680 unto them the <14494

31:8 Now the <209 were dissenters from the <2586 <302
they had had the word of God <9010 unto <576

31:9 But they had <2314 into <195 errors, for they <227 not <3354
to keep the <3355 of God, and his <35830 <1025 to the law
of Moses.

31:10 Neither <25 they <25 the <2444 of the <1795 to
continue in <17863 and supplication to God <14064 that they <780 not
<286 into temptation.

31:11 Yea, in <10980 they did <32540 the ways of the Lord in very many
instances; <773 for this <33973 Alma and his <3670 went into
the land to <127 the word unto <103

31:12 Now, when they had come into the <717 <582 to <483
<17640 they <14662 that the <142 had <14334 <11858 and
that they did <5985 <422 <422 on one day of the week, <295
day they did call the day of the <586 and they did <11703 <549 a
<696 <19 Alma and his <74 had <1312 beheld;

31:13 For they had a <1655 <52 up in the center of <67 <14741 a
<11 for standing, <30 was high <19289 the <44048 and the top <23315
<164 only admit one person.

31:14 <5245 <13556 <3332 to <59 must go <688 and <10335
upon the top <24916 and <25936 <10 his <2076 <4035 heaven, and
cry with a loud <17158 <1148

31:15 Holy, holy God; we <1355 that thou art God, and we <7 that
thou art holy, and that thou wast a <1761 and that thou art a <6
and that thou wilt be a <1496 <3785

31:16 Holy God, we <34 that thou hast <787 us from our
<5377 and we do not <14 in the <20461 of our <1674 <120
was <3191 down to them by the childishness of <138 <4050 but we
<23 that thou hast elected us to be thy holy <10555 and also
thou hast made it <5223 unto us that <1220 <1036 be no <2609

31:17 But thou art the same yesterday, today, and <15763 and thou
hast <40 us that we <25 be <14038 whilst all <23951 us are
<13 to be cast by thy <26042 down to <8178 for the <85 holiness, O
God, we <10905 <15912 and we also <5 thee that thou hast <28 us,
that we may not be led away <265 the <2650 <2333 of our
<119 <34 doth bind them down to a <3216 of <2906 <10 doth
lead <122 <806 to wander far from <1605 our God.

31:18 And <806 we <53 <11 O God, that we are a <23403 and a holy
<810 <3957

31:19 Now it came to pass that <63 Alma and his <324 and his sons
had <4315 <540 <8879 they were <15840 <23826 all <48601

31:20 For <394 <3227 man did go <286 and offer up <22 same
<34299

31:21 Now the <340 was <810 by them Rameumptom, which, <1018
<20278 is the holy stand.

31:22 Now, from this <329 they did <36 up, <44 man, the <11351
<509 unto God, thanking <119 God that they were <100 of him, and
that he did not lead them away <95 the <275 of <21 <156
and that <5 <145 were not stolen away to <269 in <1932 to
<7662 <162 they knew <1497 <12528

31:23 Now, <32 the <775 had all offered up <7066 <8 this
<27755 they <5443 to <38 homes, <462 <15510 of <5 God <176
<1093 they had <10621 <506 <506 <8 to the holy stand,
to <97 up <32 <32 <21 manner.

31:24 Now when Alma saw this his <977 was grieved; for he saw that
they were a <10096 and a <32747 <995 yea, he saw that <32 <96
were set upon <24622 and upon <22502 and upon all <538 of fine goods.

31:25 Yea, and he also saw that <27 <27 were <10199 up unto <709
<7308 in <10 pride.

31:26 And he <15 up his <4977 to <503 and <25639 <498 O, how
long, O <1116 wilt thou <5778 that thy <13533 <376 <5175 here below
in the <38280 to <1919 such <36135 <1322 <798 the <1188 of
men?

31:27 <1709 O God, they cry unto <319 and yet <61 <71 are
<5837 up in <7 <68 <18 O God, they cry unto thee with
<11 mouths, <5323 they are <40062 up, even to greatness, with the
vain <217 of the world.

31:28 <31 O my God, <26 <40066 <47197 and <4 ringlets, and
<4 bracelets, and <3 ornaments of <150 and all <6 <22650
<32 <246 they are ornamented with; and <345 <11 <72 are set
upon <1329 and yet they cry unto thee and say—We <410 <91 O God, for
we are a <311 <266 unto <11 <80 <5341 <134 <15708

31:29 Yea, and they say that thou hast made it <555 unto them that
<556 <21 be no <556

31:30 O Lord God, how long wilt thou <174 that such <161 and
infidelity <22 be <166 this <15722 O <190 wilt thou give me
<8836 that I may bear with mine <38451 For I am infirm, and
such <31 <26 this <78 doth pain my <16722

31:31 O <34 my <305 is <1282 <43207 wilt thou comfort my
soul in <72 O <15 wilt thou <4485 unto me that I may have
<54 that I may <77 with <8081 <483 <12902 <155 <76
come upon me, <1317 of the <1331 of this <542

31:32 O <38 wilt thou <48 my <5274 and give unto me <1806 and
also my fellow laborers who are with me—yea, <1166 and <1166 and
<6661 and also <1147 and <25148 and also my two sons—yea, even all
<60 wilt thou comfort, O <6048 Yea, wilt thou <46 <216 <2251 in
<94

31:33 Wilt thou <96 unto them that they may have <95 that they
may bear <24 <94 <94 <94 come upon them <93 of the
<18937 of this <94

31:34 O <94 wilt thou <36 unto us that we may have <4708 in
<2309 them <488 unto thee in <59

31:35 <316 O <26 <47 <71 are precious, and many of them are
our <854 <1070 give unto us, O <18 <2046 and <8083 that we
may <2049 <4712 our <585 <41 unto <14925

31:36 Now it came to pass that when Alma had said <127 <2200 that he
clapped his <965 upon all them who were with him. And <350 as he
<15 his <15 upon <351 they were <5055 with the Holy <19099

31:37 And <573 that they did <46963 <590 one from <12778
<25489 no <1384 for <9 what they <1382 eat, or what they
<6 drink, or what they <5 put on.

31:38 And the Lord provided for them that they <15 <20097 not,
<3065 <5 they <26392 yea, and he also gave them <193 that
they <13 <289 no <591 of <5937 save it were <508 up
in the joy of <168 Now this was <1280 to the <750 of <37247 and
this <213 he <23447 in <26767

Alma <1728 32

32:1 And it came to pass that they did go <13990 and <1688 to <1245
the word of God unto the <1852 entering into <212 <1228 and
into <5 houses; yea, and even they did <23 the word in <11
streets.

32:2 And it came to pass that <158 much <3128 <430 <175 they <48
to have <268 <8 the poor class of <719 for <197 they were
cast out of the <8374 <95 of the coarseness of <45 apparel—

32:3 <1548 they were not <39671 to <1366 into <14 <21
to <1218 God, <900 esteemed as filthiness; <1451 they were poor;
yea, they were <11 by <20 <961 as dross; <14 they were
poor as to <613 of the <20197 and also they were poor in <42809

32:4 Now, as Alma was <15450 and <851 unto the <526 upon the
hill Onidah, <585 came a <775 <14112 unto him, who were <1538 of
whom we have been speaking, of whom were poor in <2736 <103 of
<67 poverty as to the <61 of the <706

32:5 And they came unto <222 and the one who was the <33359 <147
them said unto him: <408 what <451 <362 my <102 do, for they
are despised of all men <49 of <48 poverty, yea, and more
<50145 by our priests; for they have cast us out of our <152
<487 we have <3451 <11451 to <15189 with our own <18641 and they
have cast us out <40 of our <7264 poverty; and we have no <1083
to <181 our God; and <217 what <71 we do?

32:6 And now when Alma <1136 <2367 he <21343 him <2927 his face
<2266 <1410 him, and he <18868 with <154 joy; for he <6
that <90 <559 had <5511 <39773 them and that they were in a
preparation to hear the <1696

32:7 <255 he did say no more to the <22998 multitude; but he
<17398 <1176 his <13589 and <14744 unto <197 whom he beheld, who were
<46 <5557 and said unto <7506

32:8 I <954 that ye are lowly in <20783 and if so, <7638 are ye.

32:9 <16575 thy <6484 hath <20931 What <117 we do?—for we are cast
out of our <392 that we <2648 <137 our God.

32:10 <27 I say unto you, do ye <9022 that ye <18 <18 God
save it be in your <195 only?

32:11 Moreover, I <1583 ask, do ye <24 that ye must not <25 God
only once in a week?

32:12 I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your
<74 that ye may be <28282 and that ye may <17143 <9722 for it
is necessary that ye <554 <10 <10 for it is <244 that ye are
cast out, that ye are <298 of your <307 <14 of your
<259 <300 that ye are <2620 to a lowliness of <154 for ye
are necessarily <11 to be humble.

32:13 And now, <30 ye are <33534 to be <7538 <173 are ye;
for a man sometimes, if he is <15 to be <85 seeketh
<5788 and now surely, <1706 <9321 <183 find <20581 and
he that findeth <8396 and endureth to the end the same <16 be <11368

32:14 And now, as I said unto you, that <61 ye were <46 to be
<62 ye were <11616 do ye not <176 that they are more <73
who <270 <16 <736 <25 of the word?

32:15 Yea, he that <14 humbleth <27685 and <72 of his <12515
and <67 to the end, the same <67 be blessed—yea, much more
<39 than they who are <60 to be <43 <42 of <366
<158 poverty.

32:16 <1817 <20 are they who <16 <59 <9424 <601
<24 to be humble; or <5152 in <361 <857 <18 is he that
<31180 in the word of God, and is <26157 <26 stubbornness of
<553 yea, <6 <32 <189 to know the <6041 or even <38
to <6516 <3432 they will <3157

32:17 Yea, <599 are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign
from <1370 then we <105 know of a surety; then we <7 <33

32:18 Now I ask, is this faith? <580 I say unto you, Nay; for if a
man <6211 a <15826 he hath no <2472 to <4280 for he <11 it.

32:19 And now, how much more <45611 is he that <15 the will of God
and <39446 it not, than he that only believeth, or only hath <38 to
<39 and falleth into transgression?

32:20 Now of this <57 ye must <49932 <74 I say unto you, that it
is on the one hand even as it is on the other; and it <108 be unto
<1673 man <923 to his <9896

32:21 And now as I said <5431 faith—faith is not to have a <32471
<2886 of <7380 <801 if ye have <7377 ye hope for <741
<680 are not <22657 <4 are <4592

32:22 And now, <659 I say unto you, and I <499 that ye <447
<9610 that God is <6103 unto all who <1701 on his <20691
<48 he desireth, in the <6871 <10398 that ye <24 <127 yea,
even on his <647

32:23 And now, he imparteth his word by <8586 unto men, yea, not only
men but <28118 <27947 Now this is not all; little <1581 do have <2943
<6018 unto them many <34990 <89 confound the wise and the learned.

32:24 And now, my <7362 <1202 as ye have <2163 to know of me
what ye <161 do <368 ye are <45453 and cast out—now I do not
<3354 that ye <89 <436 that I mean to <3016 you only <180
to that <56 is true—

32:25 For I do not mean that ye all of you have been <356 to
<402 yourselves; for I <3209 <143 that <353 are some <904 you
who <165 <15 <26938 let them be in <5164 <24780
they might.

32:26 Now, as I said <227 faith—that it was not a <226
knowledge—even so it is with my <3886 Ye <717 know of <468 surety
at <30489 unto perfection, any more than <240 is a <26 knowledge.

32:27 But <231 if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to
an experiment upon my <478 and <10001 a particle of <9929 yea,
even if ye can no more than <143 to <230 let this <5 work in
you, even <1915 ye <113 in a <1267 that ye can give <950 for a
<7877 of my <85

32:28 Now, we will compare the word unto a <46110 Now, if ye give <278
that a seed may be planted in your <531 <89 if it be a true <46150
or a good <5 if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will
<3840 the <4112 of the <1469 <32 it will <19249 to swell <20534
your breasts; and when you feel <1093 <4576 motions, ye will <16
to say <17 yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good <54 or
that the word is <30408 for it beginneth to enlarge my <9563 yea, it
<8 to enlighten my understanding, yea, it <7 to be
delicious to me.

32:29 Now <70 <251 not this increase your <579 I say unto you,
Yea; <14975 it hath not grown up to a <219 <219

32:30 But <28 as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and <48 to
grow, then you must <87 say that the seed is <33833 for <1036 it
<22 and <22 and <22 to grow. And now <35 will
not this <11226 your <64 Yea, it will <6 your faith: for
ye will say I know that this is a good <46348 for <40 it sprouteth
and <38 to <38

32:31 And now, <42 are ye sure that this is a good seed? I say unto
you, Yea; for <594 seed <10220 <1134 unto its own likeness.

32:32 <805 if a seed groweth it is <171 but if it <7 not,
<57 it is not <11 <550 it is cast <14231

32:33 And now, <59 <478 ye have tried the experiment, and
<279 the <212 and it swelleth and <124 and <86 to <145
ye must <145 know that the seed is good.

32:34 And now, <37 is your <652 perfect? Yea, your <4
is <190 in that <16049 and your <418 is dormant; and this <57
ye <845 for ye know that the word hath swelled your <36614 and ye also
know that it hath sprouted up, that your <25406 doth <301 to be
enlightened, and your mind doth <9 to expand.

32:35 O <10494 is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, <55 it is
light; and <526 is <9558 is <135 <11 it is discernible,
<140 ye must know that it is <251 and now <102 <1620 ye have
tasted this <7323 is your <105 <109

32:36 <1260 I say unto you, Nay; <1752 must ye lay <12649 your <500
for ye have only <30066 your <122 to plant the seed that ye <2987
try the <528 to know if the seed was <163

32:37 And <60 as the tree <185 to <185 ye will say: Let us
nourish it with <1431 care, that it may get root, that it may grow up,
and <1925 <269 <6616 unto us. And now <37 if ye <27 it with
much care it will get <27 and grow up, and <24 <24 fruit.

32:38 But if ye neglect the tree, and take no <1895 for its
nourishment, <290 it will not get any root; and when the heat of the
sun <4729 and scorcheth it, <169 it hath no root it withers <6736
and ye pluck it up and cast it out.

32:39 Now, this is not <26 the seed was not <201 <164 is it
<10 the <100 <2995 <496 not be desirable; but it is <11
your <18985 is barren, and ye will not <111 the <87 <224 ye
<734 have the <28 <5871

32:40 And <23306 if ye will not <21 the <1163 looking <6061 with
an eye of <206 to the <25 <3023 ye can <2622 <85 of the <8
of the tree of <7571

32:41 But if ye will <36 the <36 yea, <4 the tree as it
<214 to <214 by your <41 with <209 diligence, and with
<37088 <56 <56 to the <42 <50 it <916 take <159 and
<168 it <7 be a tree springing up unto <9561 <54

32:42 And <118 of your <7677 and your <42 and your <2330

that is <30668 yea, and pure <9 all that is pure; and ye shall feast
upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither
<17 ye thirst.

32:43 Then, my brethren, ye <11 reap the rewards of your faith, and
your diligence, and patience, and long-suffering, waiting for the tree
to bring forth <46 unto you.

Alma Chapter 33

33:1 Now after Alma had spoken these words, they sent <23 unto him
desiring to know whether they should believe in one God, that they
might obtain this <42 of which he had spoken, or how they <20
plant the seed, or the word of <16 he had <16 <4 he said must
be planted in their hearts; or in what manner they <28 begin to
exercise <12 faith.

33:2 And Alma said unto them: Behold, ye have said that ye could not
worship your God because ye are cast out of your synagogues. But
behold, I say unto you, if ye suppose that ye cannot <24 God, ye do
greatly err, and ye ought to search the scriptures; if ye <20 that
they have taught you this, ye do not understand them.

33:3 Do ye remember to have read what Zenos, the prophet of old, has
said concerning prayer or worship?

33:4 For he said: Thou art merciful, O God, for thou hast heard my
prayer, even when I was in the wilderness; yea, thou wast merciful when
I prayed <38 those who were mine enemies, and thou didst turn
them to me.

33:5 Yea, O God, and thou wast <29 unto me when I did cry unto
thee in my field; when I did cry unto thee in my <61 and thou <40
hear me.

33:6 And again, O God, when I did turn to my house thou <20 hear me
in my prayer.

33:7 And when I did turn unto my closet, O Lord, and <91 unto thee,
thou <27 hear me.

33:8 Yea, thou art <81 unto thy children when they cry unto <21
to be <136 of thee and not of men, and thou wilt hear <186

33:9 Yea, O God, thou hast been <34 unto me, and <26 my cries in
the midst of thy congregations.

33:10 Yea, and thou hast also <19 me when I have been cast out and
have been despised by mine enemies; yea, thou <85 hear my cries, and
wast angry with mine <185 and thou <13 visit them in thine anger
with speedy destruction.

33:11 And thou <16 hear me <319 of mine afflictions and my
sincerity; and it is <11 of thy Son that thou hast been thus
<94 unto me, therefore I will cry unto thee in all mine
afflictions, for in thee is my joy; for thou hast turned thy judgments
away from me, <40 of thy Son.

33:12 And now Alma said unto <396 Do ye <461 <279 scriptures <432
have been written by them of old?

33:13 <414 if ye do, ye must <22 what Zenos said; for, behold he
<337 Thou hast <56 away thy <57 <53 of thy Son.

33:14 Now <422 my <566 I would ask if ye have read the
scriptures? If ye have, how can ye disbelieve on the Son of God?

33:15 For it is not <72 that <57 alone spake of <560 things, but
Zenock also <8 of <8 things—

33:16 For <54 he <72 Thou art angry, O <298 with this people,
<75 they will not <454 thy mercies <116 thou hast bestowed
upon them <14 of thy Son.

33:17 And now, my <89 ye see that a second <466 of old has
testified of the Son of God, and <29 the people <108 not
<45 his words they stoned him to death.

33:18 But <74 this is not all; <86 are not the only ones who have
<664 <468 the Son of God.

33:19 <182 he was <13 of by Moses; yea, and <180 a type was
raised up in the wilderness, that whosoever <61 look upon it <677
live. And many did look and <6

33:20 But few understood the meaning of <241 <157 and this <91
of the hardness of <661 hearts. But there were many who were so
hardened that they <46 not look, <311 they perished. Now the
reason they <11 not look is <34 they did not <262 that it
<12 heal <441

33:21 O my <160 if ye <692 be healed by merely casting about your
eyes that ye <89 be healed, <27 ye not <111 quickly, or <6 ye
rather harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful, that ye <14
not cast <33 your eyes, that ye <32 perish?

33:22 If so, wo <869 come upon you; but if not so, then cast <24
your eyes and <781 to <86 in the Son of God, that he will come to
redeem his <274 and that he <35 suffer and die to atone for <143
sins; and that he <13 rise again from the dead, <288 <7 <904 to
pass the resurrection, that all men <10 stand before him, to be
judged at the last and judgment day, according to <39 works.

33:23 And now, my <146 I desire that ye <30 <889 this word in
your hearts, and as it beginneth to swell even so nourish it by your
<877 And <297 it will become a tree, springing up in you unto
everlasting life. And then may God grant unto you that your burdens may
be light, through the joy of his Son. And even all this can ye do if ye
will. Amen.

Alma <1007 34

34:1 And now it came to pass that <1013 Alma had <336 <359 <376
unto them he sat down upon the ground, and Amulek arose and began to
teach them, saying:

34:2 My <121 I think that it is impossible that ye <987 be
ignorant of the things <173 have been <46 <395 the coming of
Christ, who is <936 by us to be the Son of God; yea, I know that
<68 <28 were <17 unto you bountifully <193 your dissension
from among us.

34:3 And as ye have desired of my beloved brother that he <62 make
known unto you what ye <8 do, <365 of your afflictions; and he
hath <70 somewhat unto you to prepare your minds; yea, and he hath
exhorted you unto faith and to patience—

34:4 Yea, even that ye <346 have so much <16 as even to <240 the
word in your <240 that ye may try the experiment of its goodness.

34:5 And we have beheld that the great question <137 is in your minds
is <1188 the word be in the Son of God, or <10 <480 <288 be no
Christ.

34:6 And ye also <36 that my <119 has proved unto you, in many
instances, that the word is in Christ unto salvation.

34:7 My <22 has called upon the <239 of <1105 that redemption
cometh <286 the Son of God, and also upon the <16 of Zenock; and
also he has appealed unto Moses, to prove that <202 <202 are true.

34:8 And now, <347 I will testify unto you of myself that <19
<20 are <20 <634 I say unto you, that I do know that <77
<108 come <228 the <1019 of men, to take upon him the
transgressions of his <476 and that he <20 <472 for the sins of
the world; for the Lord God hath <225 it.

34:9 For it is expedient that an atonement <248 be made; for
<464 to the <184 plan of the Eternal God <170 must be an
<20 made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all
are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except
it be <153 the <30 <224 it is <57 <54 be made.

34:10 For it is <11 that <52 <13 be a <62 and last
sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, <1501 of beast, <3 of
any <1395 of fowl; for it <120 not be a human <24 but it must
be an infinite and eternal sacrifice.

34:11 Now <48 is not any man that can <43 his own blood <75
will <154 for the sins of another. Now, if a man murdereth, <712
will our law, <19 is just, take the life of his brother? I say unto
you, Nay.

34:12 But the law requireth the life of him who hath murdered;
<798 <62 can be nothing <36 is short of an <80 <137
<8 will suffice for the sins of the world.

34:13 Therefore, it is <140 that <30 <140 be a <140 and last
<116 and then <124 <12 be, or it is <19 <6 <18 be,
a stop to the shedding of blood; then <19 the law of Moses be
fulfilled; yea, it <10 be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and
none <11 have passed away.

34:14 And <339 this is the whole <922 of the law, <25 whit
pointing to that <71 and last <70 and that <6 and last
<170 will be the Son of God, yea, <114 and eternal.

34:15 And thus he <52 <792 salvation to all <963 who <7 <838
on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to <21
<861 the bowels of mercy, <150 overpowereth justice, and bringeth
<11 means unto men that they may have <558 unto repentance.

34:16 And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of <27 and encircles
them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no <30 unto
repentance is exposed to the <120 law of the <29 of justice;
<223 only unto him that has <22 unto <21 is brought <65
the <125 and <307 plan of redemption.

34:17 Therefore may God <827 unto you, my <756 that ye may <956
to <1737 your <34 unto repentance, that ye <10 to call upon his
holy name, that he <663 have <94 upon you;

34:18 Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save.

34:19 Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in <1691 unto him.

34:20 Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your
flocks.

34:21 Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both
morning, mid-day, and evening.

34:22 Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies.

34:23 Yea, cry unto him <14 the devil, who is an enemy to all
righteousness.

34:24 Cry unto him over the crops of your <73 that ye may prosper
in <1180

34:25 Cry over the flocks of your <18 that they may increase.

34:26 But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets,
and your secret places, and in your wilderness.

34:27 Yea, and when you do not cry unto the <1419 let your <1202 be
full, drawn out in <161 unto him continually for your welfare, and
also for the welfare of <345 who are around you.

34:28 And now <404 my <932 <244 I say unto you, do not
<1921 that this is all; for <1044 ye have done all <756 <1341 if
ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and <1681 not the sick and
afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye <1549 to <62 who <1195
in need—I say unto you, if ye do not any of <44 <44 <68 your
<96 is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who
do deny the <1180

34:29 <562 if ye do not <1989 to be charitable, ye are as
dross, <439 the refiners do cast out, (it <461 of no worth) and is
trodden under foot of men.

34:30 And now, my <130 I <352 that, <120 ye have received so
many witnesses, seeing that the holy <1708 <890 of <86
<87 ye come <2189 and <498 <2172 unto <478

34:31 Yea, I <34 that ye <3 come <17 and <1412 not your <211
any longer; for <116 now is the time and the day of your salvation;
and therefore, if ye will repent and <27 not your <1072
immediately <563 the <469 plan of <993 be <478 <478 unto
you.

34:32 For <42 this life is the time for men to <1138 to meet God;
yea, <772 the day of this life is the day for men to perform <1381
labors.

34:33 And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many
<132 <80 I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the
day of your <556 <2391 the end; for <160 this day of life, <195
is given us to <73 for eternity, <85 if we do not improve our
time <613 in this <22 then <1102 the night of darkness wherein
<778 can be no labor performed.

34:34 Ye <2270 say, when ye are <132 to that awful crisis, that I
will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye <24 say this; for
that same spirit <73 doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go
out of this <67 that same <19 will have <529 to <21 your body
in that <660 <879

34:35 For <100 if ye have procrastinated the day of your <128
even <130 death, <14 ye have <1515 subjected to the <39 of the
<555 and he doth seal you his; <166 the Spirit of the Lord hath
withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all
<70 over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.

34:36 And this I know, <1402 the Lord hath said he dwelleth not in
unholy temples, but in the <322 of the righteous doth he dwell; yea,
and he has also said that the <13 <309 sit down in his kingdom,
to go no more out; but <277 garments <978 be made white <1160 the
<1086 of the Lamb.

34:37 And now, my <549 <419 I <1670 that ye <24 <460
<408 <407 and that ye <8 work out your <928 with fear
<1521 God, and that ye <13 no more deny the <1558 of Christ;

34:38 That ye contend no more <716 the Holy Ghost, but that ye
receive it, and take upon you the name of <27 that ye <806
yourselves even to the dust, and <2549 God, in whatsoever <170 ye
may be in, in <202 and in truth; and that ye live in thanksgiving
daily, for the many <2092 and blessings <277 he doth bestow upon
you.

34:39 Yea, and I also exhort you, my <118 that ye be watchful unto
<606 continually, that ye may not be led away by the temptations of
the <256 that he may not overpower you, that ye may not <275 his
subjects at the last day; for <287 he rewardeth you no good thing.

34:40 And now my <175 <57 I <557 <63 you to have <2799
and that ye bear with all <1324 of <1657 that ye do not revile
<156 <701 who do cast you out <272 of your exceeding poverty,
lest ye <63 sinners like unto them;

34:41 But that ye have <45 and bear with <31 <2378 with
a firm hope that ye <274 one day rest from all your afflictions.

Alma <1844 35

35:1 Now it came to pass that <519 <1828 had made an end of <263
<2860 they withdrew themselves from the multitude and came over into
the land of Jershon.

35:2 Yea, and the rest of the <124 <36 they had preached the
word unto the Zoramites, also came over into the land of <29

35:3 And it came to pass that <28 the more popular part of the
Zoramites had consulted together <1869 the <1661 <243 had been
<44 unto <1905 they were <2557 <147 of the word, for it did
destroy <383 craft; <1188 they <189 not hearken unto the words.

35:4 And they sent and gathered <42 throughout all the land all
the <1642 and <53 with them <54 the <54 <54 had been
spoken.

35:5 Now <45 rulers and <3 priests and <3 teachers did not let
the <2376 know <28 <10 desires; <61 they found out
privily the <1824 of all the people.

35:6 And it came to pass that <119 they had <23 out the <21 of all
the <69 <228 who were in favor of the <70 <70 had been <1705
by Alma and his brethren were cast out of the land; and they were many;
and they came over also into the land of <180

35:7 And it came to pass that Alma and his <35 did minister unto
<1159

35:8 Now the <103 of the <190 were <176 with the <8 of
Ammon who were in Jershon, and the chief ruler of the <236 <984
a very wicked man, sent over unto the <25 of <24 <3139 them
that they <538 cast out of <145 land all <112 who came over from
them into <11 land.

35:9 And he breathed out many threatenings <392 <76 And now the
<41 of <41 did not fear <24 words; <180 they did not cast
them out, but they did <565 all the poor of the <96 that came
over unto <410 and they did <2281 <284 and did clothe <4 and did
give unto them lands for <43 inheritance; and they did administer
unto them <1872 to <11 wants.

35:10 Now this did stir up the <47 to <2865 <81 the <77 of
Ammon, and they <2240 to mix with the Lamanites and to stir them up
also to <23 <23 <104

35:11 And thus the <35 and the <22 <28 to make
preparations for war <20 the <43 of <42 and also <7 the
Nephites.

35:12 And thus ended the seventeenth year of the reign of the judges
over the <28 of Nephi.

35:13 And the <9 of <157 departed out of the land of <225 and
came over into the land of Melek, and gave <700 in the land of Jershon
for the armies of the Nephites, that they <2559 <751 with the <10
of the <91 and the <7 of the Zoramites; and thus commenced a
war betwixt the <15 and the <29 in the eighteenth year of
the <86 of the judges; and an account <591 be <1080 of <178 wars
hereafter.

35:14 And Alma, and <127 and <13 <550 and also the two sons of
Alma returned to the land of Zarahemla, <417 having been instruments
in the hands of God of bringing many of the <175 to repentance;
and as many as were <1092 to <1022 were driven out of <47
<415 but they have <257 for <8 inheritance in the land of <146
and they have taken up arms to defend themselves, and <18 wives, and
children, and <6 lands.

35:15 Now <90 <389 grieved for the iniquity of his <484 yea for
the wars, and the bloodsheds, and the contentions <487 were <2223
<330 and <95 been to declare the <609 or sent to <6 the <6
<17 all the <222 in <1925 city; and <1388 that the <1035 of the
<12 <281 to wax hard, and that they <7 to be offended <647 of
the strictness of the <36 his heart was exceedingly sorrowful.

35:16 <1476 he caused that his sons <459 be <645 together,
that he <240 give unto them <56 one his charge, separately,
<618 the <2326 pertaining unto <1708 And we have an
<221 of his commandments, <101 he gave unto them <405 to his
own record.

Alma <818 36

36:1 My son, give ear to my <478 for I swear unto you, that inasmuch
as ye <262 keep the commandments of God ye <7 <1747 in the <524

36:2 I <744 that ye <90 do as I have done, in remembering the
captivity of our fathers; for they were in bondage, and none <2947
deliver them <2317 it was the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob; and he surely did <24 them in <236
<918

36:3 And now, O my son Helaman, <1016 thou art in thy youth, and
<1293 I <1459 of thee that thou wilt hear my <728 and learn of
me; for I do know that <3100 <106 put <45 trust in God <6 be
supported in <9 trials, and <3 troubles, and <3 <992
and <15 be lifted up at the last day.

36:4 And I <131 not that ye <2792 that I know of myself—not of the
temporal but of the spiritual, not of the carnal mind but of God.

36:5 Now, <96 I say unto you, if I had not been born of God I
<174 not have <2765 <1020 things; but God has, by the mouth of his
holy angel, made <14 <264 <17 unto me, not of any worthiness of
myself.

36:6 For I went <1659 with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to <971 the
church of God; but <67 God sent his holy angel to stop us by the
way.

36:7 And <18 he <3381 unto us, as it were the voice of thunder, and
the <2204 earth did tremble beneath our feet; and we all fell to the
earth, for the fear of the Lord came upon us.

36:8 But <44 the <37 said unto me: Arise. And I <2972 and stood
up, and <2781 the angel.

36:9 And he said unto me: If thou wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no
more to <108 the <107 of God.

36:10 And it came to pass that I fell to the earth; and it was for the
space of three days and <3 nights that I <341 not open my mouth,
<2619 had I the use of my limbs.

36:11 And the <151 <137 more <192 unto me, <446 were <3733 by my
<658 but I did not hear <555 for when I <14 the words—If thou
wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to <91 the <91 of
God—I was struck with such <1882 fear and amazement lest perhaps I
<262 be <117 that I fell to the <184 and I did hear no more.

36:12 But I was racked with <1721 torment, for my soul was harrowed
up to the greatest degree and <16 with all my sins.

36:13 Yea, I did <1593 all my sins and iniquities, for <105 I was
tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled
<902 my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments.

36:14 Yea, and I had murdered many of his <723 or <3439 led them
away unto destruction; yea, and in fine so <121 had been my
<63 that the very thought of <1642 into the presence of my God
did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.

36:15 Oh, <22 I, that I <222 be banished and <1487 extinct both
soul and body, that I <680 not be <825 to <2214 in the <42 of
my God, to be <3413 of my deeds.

36:16 And now, for <265 days and for <4 <269 was I racked, even
with the <136 of a damned soul.

36:17 And it came to pass that as I was thus <181 with <196 <2003
I was <196 up by the memory of my many sins, <383 I remembered
also to have <274 my father prophesy unto the <809 <758 the
<128 of one Jesus <3329 a Son of God, to <2905 for the sins of the
<1965

36:18 Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my
heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have <2612 on me, who am in the gall
of bitterness, and am encircled <535 by the <3492 chains of
<3811

36:19 And now, <89 when I <183 <4332 I <182 <281 my <133
no more; yea, I was <114 up by the <114 of my sins no <335

36:20 And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my
soul was filled with joy as <1714 as was my pain!

36:21 Yea, I say unto you, my son, that <2160 <62 be <2986 so
exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and <3666 I say unto
you, my son, that on the other hand, <29 can be <29 so <28
and sweet as was my joy.

36:22 Yea, methought I saw, even as our <200 Lehi saw, God sitting
upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in
the attitude of singing and praising <793 God; yea, and my soul did
long to be there.

36:23 But <160 my limbs did <1421 <22 strength <4375 and I
<632 upon my feet, and did manifest unto the <256 that I had been
born of God.

36:24 Yea, and from that time even <2201 now, I have labored without
ceasing, that I <372 <2476 <2697 unto <1205 that I <7 <7
them to taste of the <174 joy of <494 I did taste; that they
<18 also be born of God, and be <196 with the Holy Ghost.

36:25 Yea, and now <94 O my son, the Lord doth give me <1125
<476 joy in the <2534 of my labors;

36:26 For <1151 of the word <55 he has imparted unto me, <34
many have been born of God, and have tasted as I have tasted, and have
seen eye to eye as I have seen; <1582 they do know of <887 <695
of <41 I have <4742 as I do know; and the knowledge <11 I have is
of God.

36:27 And I have been <1007 <2653 trials and troubles of <1194
kind, yea, and in all <2045 of <2045 yea, God has delivered me
from prison, and from bonds, and from death; yea, and I do put my <1049
in him, and he will still <1106 me.

36:28 And I know that he will raise me up at the last day, to dwell
with him in glory; yea, and I will praise him forever, for he has
<590 our fathers out of Egypt, and he has swallowed up the Egyptians
in the Red Sea; and he led them by his <2413 into the promised <1434
yea, and he has <96 them out of bondage and <1220 from time
to time.

36:29 Yea, and he has also <55 our <55 out of the land of
Jerusalem; and he has also, by his <512 power, <39 them
out of <40 and captivity, from time to time even down to the
present day; and I have always retained in remembrance <364 captivity;
yea, and ye also <4878 to retain in remembrance, as I have <1299 <16
captivity.

36:30 But <265 my son, this is not all; for ye <26 to know as I do
<2509 that <1355 as ye <1220 keep the <1354 of God ye <7
<1355 in the <128 and ye <27 to know <94 that <23 as ye
will not keep the <25 of God ye <25 be cut off from his
presence. Now this is <1430 to his word.

Alma <1428 37

37:1 And now, my son <1333 I command you that ye take the records
<311 have been entrusted with me;

37:2 And I also <21 you that ye keep a record of this <1598
<52 as I have <129 upon the plates of Nephi, and keep all <363
<364 sacred <41 I have kept, even as I have kept <1055 for it is
for a wise purpose that they are kept.

37:3 And <31 <38 of brass, <31 contain <6 engravings, <4
have the <82 of the holy <3005 upon <1967 <11 have the
genealogy of our forefathers, even from the beginning—

37:4 <3902 it has been prophesied by our fathers, that they <1082 be
kept and handed down from one generation to another, and be kept and
preserved by the hand of the Lord <583 they <26 go <3037 unto <433
nation, kindred, tongue, and <127 that they <191 know of the
mysteries contained thereon.

37:5 And now <258 if they are kept they must <280 <274
brightness; yea, and they will <8 <8 <7 yea, and also
<36 all the <122 <105 do <121 that <4 is holy writ.

37:6 Now ye may <3266 that this is foolishness in me; but <3044 I
say unto you, that by small and simple <187 are <608 <3 <390
to pass; and <12 <3631 in many instances doth confound the wise.

37:7 And the Lord God doth work by <19 to <685 <917 his <32 and
<1208 purposes; and by very <33 <14 the Lord doth <32 the
wise and <3676 <21 the <2782 of many souls.

37:8 And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in God that <225 <71
<163 be preserved; for <140 they have enlarged the <936 of this
<166 yea, and convinced many of the error of <142 ways, and <97
them to the <644 of <10 God unto the <57 of <6 <57

37:9 Yea, I say unto you, were it not for <56 <56 that <3
<280 do contain, <167 are on <8 plates, <2130 and his <2378
<950 not have <58 so many thousands of the <2087 of the
incorrect tradition of <49 <1782 yea, <26 <33 and <6
<1721 <71 them unto <833 that is, they <7 them to the
<78 of the Lord <19 God, and to rejoice in <1134 <4210 <8
Redeemer.

37:10 And who knoweth but what they will be the <169 of <2083 many
<64 of <359 yea, and also many <7 of our stiffnecked
<1466 the <2159 who are now hardening <40 <1997 in sin and
<1319 to the <61 of <11 Redeemer?

37:11 Now <88 <324 are not yet fully made <1698 unto me;
<822 I <305 forbear.

37:12 And it may <4052 if I only say they are <379 for a wise
purpose, <152 <458 is <31 unto God; for he doth counsel in <231
over all his works, and his paths are straight, and his course is one
<280 round.

37:13 O remember, <1 my son <564 how strict are the
<603 of God. And he <5094 If ye will keep my <11 ye
<81 <637 in the land—but if ye keep not his <13 ye <12
be cut off from his <625

37:14 And now <49 my son, that God has <603 you with <129
<3120 <97 are sacred, <3 he has kept <5 and also <7 he
will keep and preserve for a wise <116 in him, that he may show
<499 his <833 unto future generations.

37:15 And now <346 I tell you by the <3094 of prophecy, that if ye
transgress the <83 of God, <18 <62 <316 <51 are
<636 <91 be <2283 away from you by the <43 of God, and ye <13
be <835 up unto Satan, that he may sift you as chaff <3201 the
wind.

37:16 But if ye keep the <50 of God, and do with <52 <52
<53 are <52 <705 to that <6 the Lord doth <723 you,
(for you must appeal unto the Lord for all <24 <3193 ye must do
with them) <86 no <73 of <1721 or hell can take them from you,
for God is powerful to the fulfilling of all his <2926

37:17 For he will fulfil all his promises <59 he <103 make unto you,
for he has fulfilled his <13 <13 he has made unto our fathers.

37:18 For he <1005 unto them that he <2099 <195 <101 <77 for
a wise <198 in him, that he <1246 show <197 his <81 unto <197
<198

37:19 And now <94 one <22 hath he <4346 even to the
restoration of many <413 of the <484 to the <398 of the
<3306 and he hath shown <41 his <41 in <437 and he will also
<1141 show <12 his <12 in them unto <55 generations; <407
they <108 be preserved.

37:20 <4226 I <174 you, my son <360 that ye be diligent in
<146 all my <3169 and that ye be <11 in keeping the
<217 of God as they are written.

37:21 And now, I will speak unto you <1672 <2900 twenty-four
<589 that ye keep <78 that the <482 and the works of
darkness, and <498 <4096 <442 or the <4 <11 of <26 <1445
who have been <1952 may be made <1457 unto this people; yea,
all <25 murders, and robbings, and <5 plunderings, and all <4
wickedness and abominations, may be made <24 unto this <24
yea, and that ye <199 <199 interpreters.

37:22 For <180 the Lord saw that his <56 <2559 to work in
<73 yea, work <69 murders and abominations; <151 the Lord
said, if they did not <3927 they <758 be <2056 from off the face
of the earth.

37:23 And the Lord <513 I will <3843 unto my servant Gazelem, a
stone, <285 <189 shine <202 in <3835 unto <5229 that I may
discover unto my <68 who serve me, that I may <10 unto them the
<139 of <113 <664 yea, <3 <77 <150 <3 <9 of
<86 and <6 <124 and abominations.

37:24 And now, my son, <119 interpreters were prepared that the word
of God <317 be <299 <66 he spake, <5231

37:25 I will <908 <74 out of <75 unto <1779 all <43 <52
<51 and <5 <131 and <2561 they <125 I will <2173
them from off the face of the <2254 and I will <34 to <30 all
<26 secrets and <198 unto <1066 nation that <122 hereafter
<3887 the <2631

37:26 And now, my son, we see that they did not repent; <184 they
have been <253 and thus far the word of God has been <4745
yea, <47 <78 abominations have been <851 out of <90 and
made <745 unto us.

37:27 And now, my son, I <365 you that ye <1098 all <30 oaths,
and <4 covenants, and <3 agreements in <3 <40 <114
yea, and all <7 signs and <3 wonders ye <92 keep from this
<994 that they know them not, lest peradventure they <258 fall
into <63 also and be destroyed.

37:28 For <302 <1882 is a curse upon all this land, that destruction
<40 come upon all <369 workers of <223 <623 to the <463
of God, when they are <877 ripe; <131 I <3882 that this <265
<219 not be <48

37:29 <471 ye <37 keep <241 <92 plans of <86 oaths and
<4 covenants from this <86 and only <7 <268 and <3
<357 and <4 <153 <26 ye make <147 unto <1362 and ye
<9 <5492 them to abhor such <23 and <18 and murders;
and ye <14 also <15 them that <52 <67 were <376 on
<2908 of <38 <22 and <22 and <5 murders.

37:30 For <123 they <2331 all the prophets of the Lord who came
<3012 them to <3019 unto them <521 <26 iniquities; and the
<4009 of <133 whom they <27 did cry unto the Lord <16 God for
vengeance upon <15 who were <9 murderers; and thus the <6099
of God did come upon <76 <163 of <192 and <132 combinations.

37:31 Yea, and cursed be the land forever and ever unto <36 <21
of <22 and <22 combinations, even unto destruction, <362 they
<363 <843 they are <188 ripe.

37:32 And now, my son, <2198 the <1165 <408 I have <3614 unto you;
<1830 not <40 <35 <189 unto this <182 but <147 them an
<1727 hatred <2479 sin and iniquity.

37:33 Preach unto them <4896 and <4900 on the Lord <1182 <4061
<26 them to <4063 <3851 and to be meek and lowly in heart;
<14 them to withstand <414 temptation of the <4005 with <130 <32
on the Lord <33 <5527

37:34 Teach them to never be weary of good <526 but to be meek and
<41 in <41 for such <231 find rest to <36 <1325

37:35 O, <1072 my son, and <2998 <1151 in thy youth; yea, <6 in
thy youth to keep the <756 of God.

37:36 Yea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy
doings be unto the <4820 and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the
Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the <10 yea, let the
affections of thy <3253 be placed upon the Lord forever.

37:37 Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee
for good; yea, when thou liest down at <4520 lie down unto the <67
that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the
morning let thy <59 be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do <303
<1205 ye <157 be <3109 up at the last day.

37:38 And now, my son, I have <5813 to say <366 the thing
<280 our <2003 call a ball, or director—or our <7 <5709 it
Liahona, <14 is, <3442 interpreted, a compass; and the Lord <721
it.

37:39 And <419 <542 <4579 any man work <3534 the <2165 of so
curious a workmanship. And <16 it was <27 to show unto our
<47 the <1362 <45 they <586 travel in the <5027

37:40 And it did work for them <567 to <256 <292 in God;
<3260 if they had <8 to <5355 that God <1562 cause that <366
spindles <37 point the way they <5 go, <58 it was done;
<589 they had this miracle, and also many <2512 miracles wrought
by the <612 of God, day by day.

37:41 Nevertheless, <2345 <41 <18 were worked by <1716 <1547
it did show unto them <2601 <6189 They were <6295 and forgot
to <5305 <81 <73 and diligence and then <29 <17 <834
ceased, and they did not progress in <17 journey;

37:42 <3526 they tarried in the <6445 or did not <129 a
<271 course, and were afflicted with <7205 and thirst, <68 of
<30 transgressions.

37:43 And now, my son, I <1238 that ye <117 <6534 that <252
<1243 are not <2512 a shadow; for as our <178 were slothful to
give heed to this compass (now <22 <21 were temporal) they did not
prosper; even so it is with <13 <201 are spiritual.

37:44 For <163 it is as easy to give heed to the word of <2836
<22 will <185 to you a straight <231 to <1591 bliss, as it was
for our <65 to give heed to this compass, <24 <90 <24 unto
them a <25 <25 to the <1343 <944

37:45 And now I say, is <296 not a type in this thing? For just as
<3542 as this director did <988 our <2079 by following its <155
to the <37 <858 <381 the <639 of <80 if we follow <158
<16 carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of
promise.

37:46 O my son, do not let us be <158 <192 of the easiness of
the way; for so was it with our <1862 for so was it <364 for
<1300 that if they <114 look they <896 live; even so it is with us.
The way is prepared, and if we will look we may live <538

37:47 And now, my son, see that ye take care of <215 <1576 <489
yea, see that ye look to God and <6715 Go unto this <883 and <851
the <3835 and be sober. My son, farewell.

Alma <2355 38

38:1 My son, give ear to my <1423 for I say unto you, even as I said
unto <1445 that <2412 as ye <165 keep the <677 of God ye
<8 <1798 in the <2435 and <17 as ye will not keep the
<19 of God ye <18 be cut off from his <1803

38:2 And now, my son, I <836 that I <19 have <2151 joy in you,
<178 of your steadiness and your faithfulness unto God; for as you
have <4141 in your <747 to look to the Lord your God, even so I
hope that you will <5707 in <1520 his commandments; for blessed is
he that endureth to the end.

38:3 I say unto you, my son, that I have had <67 joy in thee already,
<68 of thy <65 and thy <7627 and thy patience and thy
long-suffering <1031 the <181 of the Zoramites.

38:4 For I know that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I also know that thou
wast <6991 for the word’s sake; and thou <7233 bear all <232 <434
with <46 <56 the Lord was with thee; and now thou knowest that
the Lord did <2807 thee.

38:5 And now my son, Shiblon, I <303 that ye <507 <899 that as
much as ye <169 put your <175 in God even so much ye <10 be
<1898 out of your <3895 and your <3895 and your <3895
and ye <17 be <787 up at the last day.

38:6 Now, my son, I <54 not that ye <55 <3899 that I know <95
<96 of myself, but it is the <5264 of God <493 is in me <4
maketh <19 <18 <1241 unto me; for if I had not been born of God I
<40 not have <17 <20 things.

38:7 But <565 the Lord in his <203 <3355 sent his <3708 to <366
unto me that I must stop the work of <1356 <201 his <1685 yea,
and I have seen an <24 face to face, and he <3737 with me, and his
<3836 was as <3874 and it shook the <3875 <1660

38:8 And it came to pass that I was <3521 days and <3 <3524 in the
most <3321 pain and anguish of soul; and never, <2623 I did cry out
unto the Lord <1134 <2349 for <6175 did I <3256 a remission of my
<3708 But <107 I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my <3561

38:9 And now, my son, I have told you this that ye may <1131 wisdom,
that ye may <6 of me that <652 is no <865 way or <844 whereby man
can be saved, only in and <5372 <1204 <2738 he is the life and
the <1648 of the <3552 <12 he is the word of truth and
<4335

38:10 And now, as ye have begun to <1255 the word even so I <259 that
ye <219 <436 to teach; and I <10 that ye <3 be <1966 and
temperate in all <231

38:11 See that ye are not <304 up unto pride; yea, see that ye do not
boast in your own <112 nor of your much strength.

38:12 Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle
all your passions, that ye may be <3358 with love; see that ye refrain
from idleness.

38:13 Do not pray as the <4613 do, for ye have seen that they pray
to be <3713 of men, and to be praised for <787 wisdom.

38:14 Do not say: O God, I thank thee that we are <791 than our
brethren; but <3885 say: O <1238 forgive my unworthiness, and <1465
my <2657 in mercy—yea, acknowledge your unworthiness <1487 God at
all times.

38:15 And may the Lord bless your soul, and <277 you at the last day
into his <5608 to sit down in peace. Now go, my son, and <198 the
word unto this <5160 Be <753 My son, <753

Alma <753 39

39:1 And now, my son, I have <1264 more to say unto thee than what I
said unto thy brother; for <332 have ye not observed the <702
of thy brother, his faithfulness, and his <1125 in <681 the
<749 of God? <285 has he not set a good example for thee?

39:2 For thou <622 not give so much heed unto my <961 as did thy
<42 <469 the <670 of the <670 Now this is what I have
<1596 <637 thou <30 go on unto boasting in thy <3670 and thy
<200

39:3 And this is not all, my son. Thou <24 do that <565 was grievous
unto me; for thou <11 forsake the ministry, and did go over into the
land of Siron, <65 the borders of the Lamanites, <1359 the harlot
Isabel.

39:4 Yea, she did steal away the <2791 of <5288 but this was no excuse
for <8061 my son. Thou shouldst have tended to the ministry wherewith
thou wast entrusted.

39:5 Know ye not, my son, that <620 <640 are an abomination in the
sight of the <1564 yea, most abominable above all sins save it be the
<6820 of innocent <1836 or denying the Holy Ghost?

39:6 For <211 if ye deny the Holy Ghost when it once has had <5081
in you, and ye know that ye deny it, <23 this is a sin <143 is
unpardonable; yea, and <4673 murdereth <181 the <515 and
<2498 of God, it is not easy for him to <8461 forgiveness; yea, I
say unto you, my son, that it is not easy for him to <18 a
forgiveness.

39:7 And now, my son, I <515 to God that ye had not been guilty of so
<739 a crime. I <16 not <3658 upon your crimes, to harrow up your
<385 if it were not for your good.

39:8 But <99 ye <1574 hide your crimes from God; and <1914 ye
<1914 they will <4266 as a testimony <105 you at the last day.

39:9 Now my son, I <57 that ye <600 <25 and <267 your <4224
and go no more <256 the lusts of your <7790 but cross yourself in all
<218 <4734 for <53 ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the
kingdom of God. Oh, <954 and take it upon you, and <30 <30
in <29 <636

39:10 And I <2269 you to take it upon you to <3028 with your elder
brothers in your undertakings; for <114 thou art in thy <4904 and
ye <108 in need to be nourished by your brothers. And give heed to
<591 counsel.

39:11 Suffer not <60 to be led away by any vain or foolish thing;
<7847 not the <6216 to lead away your <1810 <4176 <120 <1608 <5585
harlots. <482 O my son, how <205 <5205 ye <2372 upon the
<5346 for when they saw your conduct they <159 not <1710 in my
<2867

39:12 And now the <1015 of the Lord doth say unto me: Command thy
<7448 to do good, lest they lead away the <420 of many <507 to
<4542 <1728 I <139 you, my son, in the fear of God, that
ye <734 from your <2223

39:13 That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength;
that ye lead away the <48 of no more to do wickedly; but <713
<6441 unto <1474 and <705 your faults and that wrong <388 ye
have done.

39:14 Seek not <138 riches nor the vain <468 of this <7520 for
<202 you <316 <1557 them with you.

39:15 And now, my son, I <140 say <682 unto you <1946 the
<4505 of <950 <171 I say unto you, that it is he that <1619
<1198 come to take away the sins of the <51 yea, he <6560 to
<1131 glad tidings of <3484 unto his <747

39:16 And now, my son, this was the <564 unto <97 ye were called,
to <27 <310 glad <28 unto this <174 to <2772 <269 <7826
or <128 that <38 <1594 come unto <130 that they may <15
the <5936 of <19 <209 to hear the word at the time of his coming.

39:17 And now I will ease your mind <114 on this subject. <109
you marvel why <59 <148 <423 be <1241 so long beforehand. <13
I say unto you, is not a soul at this time as precious unto God as a
soul will be at the time of his coming?

39:18 Is it not as necessary that the plan of <6811 <49 be made
<51 unto this <112 as well as unto <95 children?

39:19 Is it not as easy at this time for the Lord to send his <1279 to
<146 <87 glad <146 unto us as unto our <4870 or as <250
the time of his <68

Alma <926 40

40:1 Now my son, here is <129 more I <248 say unto <849 for I
perceive that thy mind is worried <256 the resurrection of the
dead.

40:2 <139 I say unto you, that <1235 is no resurrection—or, I <35
say, in <1241 <1721 that this mortal does not put on immortality, this
corruption does not put on incorruption—until <82 the <299 of
<300

40:3 <43 he <3819 to pass the <58 of the <57 But
<343 my son, the <10 is not yet. Now, I unfold unto you a
mystery; nevertheless, <66 are many <3164 <289 are <4086 that no
one <3704 them save God himself. But I show unto you one <2305 <19
I have inquired diligently of God that I <296 know—that is <119
the resurrection.

40:4 <73 <45 is a time appointed that all <373 come <3012 from
the <78 Now when this time <372 no one knows; but God <58 the
time <50 is appointed.

40:5 Now, <8102 <37 <31 be one time, or a <8702 <4 or a third
<5 that men <15 come <46 from the <8452 it mattereth not; for
God <41 all <244 <729 and it sufficeth me to know that this is
the case—that <44 is a time <81 that all <35 rise from the
<80

40:6 Now <18 must needs be a <5325 <5981 the time of death and the
time of the <122

40:7 And now I <230 inquire what becometh of the <4733 of men from
this time of <29 to the time <57 for the resurrection?

40:8 Now <115 <53 is more than one time <16 for men to rise
it <105 not; for all do not die at once, and this <11 not;
all is as one day with God, and time only is measured unto men.

40:9 <2341 <46 is a time <44 unto men that they <119 rise
from the dead; and <16 is a <113 between the time of <84 and the
<110 And now, <238 this <14 of <183 what <108 of
the <109 of men is the <267 <217 I have <266 <266 of the
Lord to <4739 and this is the <16 of <17 I do know.

40:10 And when the time <256 when all <70 rise, then <3 they
know that God <221 all the times <28 are <90 unto man.

40:11 Now, <71 the <7067 of the soul <88 <85 and the
resurrection—Behold, it has been made <525 unto me by an <5705 that
the spirits of all men, as soon as they are <6264 from this <435
<5319 yea, the <17 of all men, <195 they be good or evil, are
<3844 home to that God who gave them <8678

40:12 And then <89 it come to pass, that the <34 of <931 who are
<7104 are <7483 into a <85 of happiness, <100 is <2708
paradise, a <9 of rest, a <4 of peace, where they <36 rest from
all <611 <4872 and from all care, and sorrow.

40:13 And then <19 it come to <55 that the <55 of the wicked,
yea, who are evil—for <502 they have no part nor portion of the
<965 of the <1322 for <15 they chose evil <2618 <771 than <2861
<952 the <3977 of the <1030 did enter into <778 and take
possession of <69 house—and <414 <58 be cast out into outer
darkness; <276 <9 be weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth,
and this <2132 of <26 own iniquity, <2818 led captive by the will
of the devil.

40:14 Now this is the <126 of the <290 of the <98 yea, in
<3354 and a <13 of awful, fearful looking for the fiery
indignation of the wrath of God upon <3312 thus they remain in this
state, as well as the <185 in <175 <1979 the time of <69
<350

40:15 Now, <92 are some that have <9149 that this <51 of
happiness and this <6 of misery of the <1335 <1737 the
<8991 was a first <33 Yea, I admit it may be termed a
<14 the raising of the <158 or the soul and <55
consignation to <40 or misery, <2886 to the <1646 <250 have
been <6930

40:16 And <195 <1206 it hath been <5143 that <75 is a <52
<43 a <722 of all <289 who have been, or who are, or
who <186 be, down to the <18 of <2083 from the <594

40:17 Now, we do not <4658 that this <39 <38 <61 is
<3307 of in this manner, can be the <30 of the <186 and
<89 <88 to <88 or misery. Ye <1128 <30 that this
is what it meaneth.

40:18 <739 I say unto you, Nay; but it meaneth the reuniting of the
soul with the <416 of <90 from the days of Adam down to the
<55 of <848

40:19 Now, <429 the <62 and the <7640 of <25 of whom has been
<84 <112 all be reunited at <621 the <1348 as well as the
righteous, I do not say; let it suffice; that I say that they all come
forth; or in <923 <923 <105 <57 <551 to pass <226 the
<7 of <51 who die <920 the <7 of <71

40:20 Now, my son, I do not say that <30 <16 <30 at the
<5 of <3427 but <213 I give it as my opinion, that the
<96 and the <96 are reunited, of the <79 at the
<26 of <2853 and his ascension into heaven.

40:21 But <123 it be at his <18 or after, I do not say; but
this much I say, that <260 is a <689 <615 <615 and the
<23 of the <174 and a <336 of the soul in <216 or in
<343 <372 the time <244 is <655 of God that the dead <164
come forth, and be <81 both soul and <34 and be <1507 to
<1567 <142 God, and be <5936 <339 to <124 <3154

40:22 Yea, this <1057 <4876 the <4297 of <157 <1254 of <48
has been <209 by the mouths of the prophets.

40:23 The soul <57 be restored to the <52 and the body to the <2433
yea, and <3571 limb and joint <19 be <19 to its body; yea, even
a hair of the head <14 not be lost; but all <58 <7 be <21
to <78 proper and perfect frame.

40:24 And now, my son, this is the <83 of <80 has been <79
by the <80 of the prophets—

40:25 And then <40 the <525 <4171 <1039 in the <1745 of God.

40:26 But <242 an <7995 <186 <254 upon the wicked; for they die
as to <70 <6764 to <3 of righteousness; for they are
unclean, and no unclean <873 can <1786 the <40 of God; but they
are cast out, and consigned to partake of the fruits of <99 labors or
<4 <3679 <87 have been evil; and they drink the dregs of a <2588
cup.

Alma <1333 41

41:1 And now, my son, I have <1334 to say <893 the <124
of <38 has been spoken; for <98 some have wrested the scriptures,
and have gone far astray <712 of this <7739 And I <1355 that thy
mind has been <1357 also <37 this <14 But <31 I will
explain it unto <2854

41:2 I say unto <2154 my son, that the plan of <61 is requisite
with the justice of God; for it is <10 that all <149 <1485 be
<223 to <119 <222 order. <542 it is <15 and <9048
<312 to the <3492 and <366 of <407 that the soul of man
<29 be <28 to its <291 and that <284 part of the body <13
be <14 to itself.

41:3 And it is <44 with the <68 of God that men <21 be
<364 <52 to <64 works; and if <4 <887 were good in this
<8201 and the desires of <12 <1805 were <1861 that they <28 <5586
at the last day, be <54 unto that <176 is <2103

41:4 And if <26 <38 are evil they <298 be <19 unto them for
evil. <1199 all <127 <11 be <11 to <20 <126 order,
<98 <275 to its natural frame—mortality <10001 to <1508
<1507 to incorruption—raised to endless <485 to <289 the
<290 of God, or to <11 <492 to <11 the <10 of the
<3983 the one on one <6165 the <627 on the other—

41:5 The one <45 to <38 <122 to his <109 of <1077
or good <9 to his <9 of <1013 and the <30 to evil
<12 to his <12 of <324 for as he has <9664 to do evil all
the day long even so <104 he have his reward of evil when the <3904
cometh.

41:6 And so it is on the <47 hand. If he hath repented of his <2213
and <44 righteousness <596 the end of his days, even so he <44
be rewarded unto <2859

41:7 These are they that are redeemed of the <1112 yea, <1086 are they
that are <1219 out, that are <3155 from that <148 <69 of
<1095 and thus they <619 or fall; for <358 they are <192 own
judges, <701 to do good or do <210

41:8 Now, the decrees of God are unalterable; <3860 the way is
<3534 that <2433 will may walk therein and be saved.

41:9 And now <46 my son, do not risk one more offense <2349 your
God upon <662 points of doctrine, <282 ye have <5535 risked to
commit sin.

41:10 Do not suppose, <457 it has been <600 <447
restoration, that ye <135 be <283 from sin to happiness. <409 I
say unto you, <4420 <4221 was <10

41:11 And now, my son, all men that are in a <781 of nature, or I
<1595 say, in a <7148 <1162 are in the gall of bitterness and in the
bonds of iniquity; they are <3838 God in the world, and they have
gone contrary to the nature of God; <139 they are in a <48
<13 to the <13 of <70

41:12 And now <137 is the <9416 of the word <526 to take a
<379 of a <379 <30 and <2624 it in an unnatural <74 or to
<9 it in a <15 opposite to its nature?

41:13 O, my son, this is not the case; but the <47 of the word
<48 is to <3815 back <1184 evil for <1487 or <117 for carnal,
or devilish for devilish—good for that <194 is <377 <761 for
that <7 is righteous; just for that <6 is just; <10712 for that
<7 is merciful.

41:14 <481 my son, see that you are <18 unto your <3041
deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do
all <336 <506 then <224 ye <3025 your reward; yea, ye <7 have
<3403 <233 unto you again; ye <9 have <594 <8 unto you
<9 ye <9 have a <81 <10305 <11 unto you <10 and
ye <12 have good <396 unto you again.

41:15 For that <86 ye do send out <18 <2399 unto you <6612 and be
restored; <214 the word <143 more <4594 condemneth the
sinner, and justifieth him not at all.

Alma <812 42

42:1 And now, my son, I <780 <1085 is <814 more <50 doth
worry your <2468 <6 ye <1289 understand—which is <340 the
<96 of God in the punishment of the sinner; for ye do try to
<1309 that it is injustice that the sinner <680 be <898 to a
<243 of <1328

42:2 Now <282 my son, I will <824 this <277 unto <825 For
<12 <1234 the Lord God sent our <1377 parents <984 from the garden
of Eden, to till the <10340 from whence they were taken—yea, he drew
out the man, and he <4525 at the east end of the <28 of <27
cherubim, and a flaming sword <106 <10886 <713 way, to keep the tree
of life—

42:3 Now, we see that the man had <7126 as God, knowing good and <659
and lest he <108 put <75 his <709 and take also of the tree of
<812 and eat and live <6558 the Lord God <71 cherubim and the
<62 sword, that he <31 not <1035 of the fruit—

42:4 And thus we see, that <195 was a time granted unto man to <9087
yea, a probationary <1977 a time to <2898 and <5279 God.

42:5 For <154 if Adam had put <75 his hand immediately, and
partaken of the tree of <75 he <522 have lived <75 <763 to
the word of God, <7979 no <1334 for <6024 yea, and also the word
of God <24 have been void, and the <2815 plan of <2583 <10 have
been frustrated.

42:6 But <62 it was <1341 unto man to die—therefore, as they
were cut off from the tree of life they <123 be cut off from the face
of the earth—and man became lost <75 yea, they <5 <10196 man.

42:7 And now, ye see by this that our <261 <261 were cut off both
temporally and spiritually from the <7318 of the <787 and thus we
see they <37 <8893 to <4325 <293 <769 own <10651

42:8 Now <87 it was not <10062 that man <74 be reclaimed from
this <7818 <9201 for that <114 <5373 the <121 plan of
<628

42:9 <524 as the soul <4639 <710 die, and the fall had <1446
upon all <10301 a spiritual <1311 as well as a temporal, that is, they
were cut off from the <85 of the <3586 it was <64 that
<27 <65 be <65 from this <31 <7271

42:10 <54 as they had <319 <618 sensual, and devilish, by
<751 this <259 <420 <111 a <3 for them to prepare; it
<9 a preparatory state.

42:11 And now <3133 my son, if it were not for the plan of
redemption, (laying it aside) as soon as they were dead <147 <1639
were miserable, <2008 cut off from the <87 of the Lord.

42:12 And now, <334 was no <3874 to reclaim men from this <217
<744 <425 man had <134 upon himself <877 of his own
disobedience;

42:13 <104 <315 to <10104 the plan of <2780 <162 not
be <25 about, only on conditions of <8374 of men in this
<115 <42 yea, this <106 state; for <3249 it were for
<692 conditions, <681 <31 not take effect <12 it <160 <215
the work of justice. Now the work of <595 <18 not be destroyed; if
so, God <235 cease to be God.

42:14 And thus we see that all <196 were fallen, and they were in
the grasp of <10163 yea, the <38 of God, <113 <612 them
<5301 to be cut off from his <4440

42:15 And now, the plan of <80 <62 not be <110 <1696 <81 an
<10409 <83 be <10596 <2226 God <144 atoneth for the sins of
the <956 to <869 <21 the plan of <4104 to appease the <10226 of
<152 that God <2729 be a perfect, just God, and a <841 God
also.

42:16 Now, <157 <57 not come unto men <57 <210 were a
punishment, <90 also was <4784 as the life of the soul <69 be,
affixed <953 to the plan of <1299 <20 was as <20 also as
the life of the <4150

42:17 Now, how <49 a man <573 <48 he <34 sin? How <9 he
sin if <57 was no law? How <10 <6 be a law save <5 was a
punishment?

42:18 Now, <10 was a <797 affixed, and a just law given, <63
<150 remorse of conscience unto man.

42:19 Now, if <24 was no law given—if a man <5535 he <62
die—would he be afraid he <235 die if he <11 murder?

42:20 And <1506 if <29 was no law <8730 <1230 sin men <21 not be
<27 to sin.

42:21 And if <21 was no law <69 if men sinned what <99 <250
do, or <230 either, for they <31 have no claim upon the creature?

42:22 But <30 is a law <30 and a <108 <108 and a
<201 granted; <108 <3 <32 claimeth; otherwise, <39
claimeth the creature and executeth the law, and the law inflicteth the
punishment; if not so, the <1578 of <22 <54 be <5898 and God
<6 <347 to be God.

42:23 But God ceaseth not to be God, and <49 <45 the penitent,
and <6 <1886 <447 of the atonement; and the <316 <2018
to pass the <1716 of the <2799 and the <6 of the dead
<16 back men into the <503 of God; and thus they are <1095
into his presence, to be <1700 <479 to <530 <1883 <4 to
the law and <439

42:24 For <683 <92 exerciseth all his demands, and also <69
<76 all <130 is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent
are <1449

42:25 What, do ye <1053 that <27 can rob justice? I say unto you,
Nay; not one whit. If so, God <135 <135 to be God.

42:26 And thus God <99 <416 his <729 and <354 purposes, <58
were <1506 from the foundation of the <4451 And thus <142 <19
the <867 and the <578 of men, and also <108 <4621 and
<1102

42:27 <599 O my son, <1538 will come may come and <984 of
the waters of life freely; and <15 will not come the same is not
compelled to come; but in the last day it <1234 be <166 unto him
<158 to his <8163

42:28 If he has <1676 to do <1377 and has not <1689 in his <1679
<169 evil <31 be done unto him, <30 to the <1261 of
God.

42:29 And now, my son, I <6050 that ye <387 let <657 <1349 trouble
you no more, and only let your sins <10 you, with that <4
<145 <45 <570 you down unto <10353

42:30 O my son, I <38 that ye <38 deny the <235 of God no
<8085 Do not endeavor to <4209 <3878 in the least <5324 <311 of
your <1778 by <4165 the <24 of God; but do you let the <8 of
God, and his <622 and his <5004 have full sway in your
<5850 and let it <71 you down to the dust in humility.

42:31 And now, O my son, ye are <2970 of God to preach the word unto
this <3716 And now, my son, go thy way, <3558 the word with <4694
and soberness, that thou mayest <48 <880 unto <5967 that the
<277 plan of <311 may have <490 upon <9397 And may God <10894 unto
you even <184 to my <3941 <11703

Alma <1434 43

43:1 And now it came to pass that the sons of Alma did go <1215 <4380
the <6039 to <69 the word unto <47 And <9208 <586 himself,
<557 not <3063 and he also went forth.

43:2 Now we <202 say no more <1460 <329 preaching, <692 that
they <9824 the <5331 and the truth, <75 to the <2869 of
prophecy and revelation; and they <17 <1139 the holy order of God
by <240 they were called.

43:3 And now I <1559 to an <6252 of the wars <2607 the Nephites
and the <4465 in the <9405 year of the <9404 of the judges.

43:4 For <326 it came to pass that the <4752 <1079 Lamanites;
<1591 in the commencement of the <30 year the <3776 of the
<44 saw that the <6881 were <3662 upon <3027 <893 they
made <9562 for war; yea, they <9254 <9899 <116 <9481 in
the land of <9791

43:5 And it came to pass that the <35 came with <22 thousands;
and they came into the land of Antionum, <117 is the land of the
<4171 and a man by the name of Zerahemnah was <28 leader.

43:6 And now, as the Amalekites were of a more <2863 and murderous
disposition than the <53 were, in and of <9439 <111
<32 <1387 <9822 captains over the <146 and they were
all <32 and <4684

43:7 Now this he did that he <982 <6847 <57 <6287 towards the
<7418 that he <10 <319 them into subjection to the
accomplishment of his designs.

43:8 For <176 his designs were to stir up the <68 to <9729
<861 the Nephites; this he did that he <37 usurp <350 <2459 over
<3279 and also that he <11 gain <10 over the <188 by <7493
them into bondage.

43:9 And now the design of the <17 was to support <82 lands, and
<4 <11182 and <3 <9556 and <3 <3963 that they <40
<99 them from the <9619 of <12 <12708 and also that they <14
<14 <9 rights and <3 privileges, yea, and also <5
liberty, that they <16 <10444 God <340 to <10 desires.

43:10 For they knew that if they <556 fall into the <45 of the
<172 that <677 <11 <28 God in <366 and in <373
the true and the living God, the <137 <766 destroy.

43:11 Yea, and they also knew the extreme <183 of the <17
<187 <59 <6942 who were the <326 of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, who
were <540 the <8 of Ammon—and they <36 not take up arms, yea,
they had entered into a covenant and they <15 not break it—therefore,
if they <75 fall into the <86 of the <49 they <16 be
<6737

43:12 And the <170 <11 not <4516 that they <25 be <1338
<376 they gave them <9749 for <74 inheritance.

43:13 And the <69 of <7776 did give unto the <31 a large
<3538 of <21 substance to <207 <4 armies; and thus the
<16 were compelled, alone, to <6548 <264 the <152 who
were a compound of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, and all
<2370 who had dissented from the <322 who were <345 and
<10176 and the descendants of the <10316 of Noah.

43:14 Now <26 <12 were as numerous, nearly, as were the
<318 and thus the <66 were obliged to <9962 with <78
<178 even unto bloodshed.

43:15 And it came to pass as the <490 of the <151 had <498
<499 in the land of <471 <372 the <15 of the <41
were <978 to meet them in the land of <513

43:16 Now, the leader of the <96 or the man who had been
<457 to be the <460 captain over the Nephites—now the <6
<7 took the <4633 of all the <51 of the Nephites—and his name
was Moroni;

43:17 And Moroni took all the command, and the government of <106
wars. And he was only twenty and five years old when he was <57
<49 <48 over the <44 of the <10160

43:18 And it came to pass that he met the <124 in the <5149 of
<9996 and his <248 were armed with swords, and with cimeters, and
all <6519 of weapons of war.

43:19 And when the <49 of the <35 saw that the <30 of
<8390 or that Moroni, had <153 his <10 with breastplates and
with arm-shields, yea, and also shields to <10042 <100 heads, and also
they were dressed with thick clothing—

43:20 Now the army of <619 was not <37 with any such <4866
they had only <31 swords and <3 <81 <2 bows and <3
arrows, <3 stones and <3 slings; and they were <11530 save it
were a skin <704 was girded <1196 <16 loins; yea, all were <16
save it were the <789 and the Amalekites;

43:21 But they were not <135 with breastplates, nor shields—therefore,
they were <8917 <1483 of the <126 of the <270 <1067 of
<42 armor, notwithstanding <3 number <1866 so much greater than
the <191

43:22 <2705 now it came to pass that they durst not come <403 the
<35 in the <196 of Jershon; <455 they <4082 out of the
land of Antionum into the <6565 and took <49 journey round
<99 in the <10 away by the head of the river Sidon, that they
<621 come into the land of Manti and take <3980 of the <6253 for
they did not <1378 that the <99 of <306 <522 know whither they
had gone.

43:23 But it came to <4059 as soon as they had <77 into the
wilderness <27 sent spies into the <6 to <6887 <77 camp;
and <253 <1055 <2369 of the prophecies of <1062 sent certain men
unto him, <10652 him that he <573 <4404 of the Lord <59 the
<67 of the <131 <12 go to <270 <7104 <140 the
Lamanites.

43:24 And it came to pass that the word of the Lord came unto <49 and
Alma informed the messengers of <64 that the <41 of the
<334 were marching <153 <152 in the <152 that they <143
come over into the land of Manti, that they <11 commence an attack
upon the weaker part of the <1241 And <567 <44 went and
<3043 the message unto Moroni.

43:25 Now <56 leaving a part of his army in the land of <423
lest by any <2112 a part of the <70 <112 come into that land
and take <203 of the city, took the remaining part of his army
and marched over into the land of Manti.

43:26 And he <10354 that all the <429 in that quarter of the land
<46 gather <156 <609 to battle <159 the <702 to
<166 <204 <748 and <3 country, <2 <901 and <3 liberties;
<307 they were <428 <21 the time of the <1150 of the
<186

43:27 And it came to pass that <247 <60 that his army <52 be
secreted in the valley <426 was near the bank of the <321 <321
<10 was on the west of the <10 Sidon in the <7039

43:28 And <39 <2612 <286 <203 <2216 that he <189 know when the
camp of the <148 <50 come.

43:29 And now, as <25 knew the intention of the <109 that it
was <102 <9 to <2218 <4 <755 or to subject them and
<1122 them into <9141 that they <47 establish a <3404 unto
<144 over all the <388

43:30 And he also <344 that it was the only <1577 of the <326
to <1055 <45 <1086 and <3 <1049 and <3 church, <156
he <9691 it no sin that he <86 <178 them by stratagem;
<1220 he <11131 by his <111 <131 <6911 the <102 were to
take.

43:31 <1752 he divided his army and <2085 a part over into the
valley, and concealed them on the east, and on the south of the hill
Riplah;

43:32 And the remainder he <22 in the west <28 on the west of
the <184 <194 and so down into the <554 of the land <290

43:33 And thus <2724 <192 his army <1150 to his desire, he was
<263 to meet <1537

43:34 And it came to pass that the <101 came up on the north of
the hill, <4609 a part of the army of <210 was concealed.

43:35 And as the <27 had <12681 the hill Riplah, and came into
the <89 and <8174 to <5681 the <88 <88 the army <152 was
<106 on the <123 of the <48 <10 was led by a man whose name
was Lehi, and he led his army <1633 and <9907 the <51 <496
on the east in <212 rear.

43:36 And it came to pass that the <285 when they saw the
<241 <377 upon them in <24 rear, <2994 them <34 and <75 to
<1054 with the army of Lehi.

43:37 And the work of <2715 <6874 on both sides, but it was more
dreadful on the part of the <50 for <41 nakedness was <12677
to the heavy blows of the <57 with <13 <860 and <3
<861 <111 <256 <39 almost at <3056 stroke.

43:38 While on the <3660 <3031 <2264 was now and then a man fell <1751
the <1074 by <32 <35 and the loss of blood, they <826
shielded from the more vital parts of the <3912 or the more <8 <8
of the body <20 <19 from the strokes of the <85 by <37
<879 and <4 <975 and <3 head-plates; and thus
the <87 did <5654 on the work of <84 <63 the <526

43:39 And it came to pass that the <192 <1715 frightened, <901
of the <1531 <2130 <23 <1530 even <3746 they <169 to flee
<1400 the <246 Sidon.

43:40 And they were pursued by Lehi and his men; and they were <11105
by Lehi into the <2144 of <271 and they crossed the <7 of <32
And Lehi <9617 his <754 upon the bank of the <45 <563 that they
<456 not cross.

43:41 And it came to pass that <336 and his army met the <89 in
the <325 on the <183 side of the <35 <55 and <89 to fall
upon them and to slay <394

43:42 And the <30 did flee <3559 <4425 <114 <107 the land of
Manti; and they were met <13 by the <79 of <788

43:43 Now in this case the <31 did fight exceedingly; yea, <3021
had the <9 been <5117 to <11 with such <1072 <160
<6419 and courage, no, not even from the beginning.

43:44 And they were inspired by the <1114 and the Amalekites, who
were <223 <1277 <1792 and leaders, and by Zerahemnah, who was <10
<11 captain, or <5 <4 <1363 and commander; yea, they did <55
like dragons, and many of the <248 were slain by <20 hands, yea,
for they did smite in two many of <12 head-plates, and they did
pierce many of <9 <285 and they did <19 off many of <9
arms; and thus the <107 did <12 in <10 fierce anger.

43:45 <7741 the <53 were <96 by a <6714 cause, for
they were not fighting for monarchy nor <1808 but they were <8
for <32 homes and <3 liberties, <2 wives and <3 <1789
and <4 all, yea, for <4 rites of <1737 and <5 church.

43:46 And they were doing that <435 they felt was the duty <6 they
owed to <22 God; for the Lord had said unto <229 and also unto <12
<7611 that: Inasmuch as ye are not <6391 of the <3304 offense,
<10850 the second, ye <2175 not <1698 <12273 to be <154 by the
<1724 of your <13030

43:47 And <3702 the Lord has said <40 Ye <26 <788 your families
even unto <1608 <8472 for this <7918 were the <137
contending with the <458 to <20 <2025 and <69
families, and <4 <833 <2 <991 and <3 rights, and <3
religion.

43:48 And it came to pass that when the men of <372 saw the
fierceness and the <1998 of the <44 they were <625 to shrink
and flee from <363 And <1119 perceiving <41 intent, sent <678 and
<204 <7 <4401 with <2509 thoughts—yea, the <8202 of <8
<65 <3 <897 yea, <3 freedom from <2007

43:49 And it came to pass that they <674 upon the <53 and they
<10648 with one <7245 unto the Lord <29 God, for <3 liberty and
<4 <36 from <36

43:50 And they <443 to <4232 <1096 the <285 with power; and in
that selfsame hour that they <40 unto the Lord for <31 freedom, the
<20 <26 to flee <452 <2266 and they fled even to the <532
of <533

43:51 Now, the <22 were more <1816 yea, by more than double
the <1495 of the <1821 <5926 they were <573 insomuch
that they were <1799 <1189 in one body in the <531 upon the
bank by the <531 <46

43:52 <227 the <501 of <186 <836 them <1128 yea, even on
both sides of the river, for <1829 on the east were the men of <810

43:53 <31 when <1649 saw the men of Lehi on the east of the
<51 <582 and the <47 of <47 on the west of the <12 <12
that they were <58 <233 by the <778 they were <11128 with
terror.

43:54 Now <239 when he saw <153 terror, commanded his men that they
<658 stop <6859 <11 blood.

Alma <2585 44

44:1 And it came to pass that they did stop and <12437 a pace from
<283 And <72 said unto Zerahemnah: <1642 <563 that we do
not <1181 to be men of <44 Ye know that ye are in our <553 yet we
do not <19 to slay you.

44:2 <34 we have not come out to <1374 <257 you that we <1244
shed your <6940 for <263 <445 do we <30 to <1262 any one to the
yoke of <291 But this is the very <423 for <498 ye have come
<37 us; yea, and ye are <12280 with us <849 of our <415

44:3 But now, ye <10089 that the Lord is with us; and ye <9 that he
has <1529 you into our hands. And now I <1685 that ye <160
<8267 that this is done unto us <45 of our religion and our
<8342 in <5338 And now ye see that ye <4171 <1363 this our <13340

44:4 Now ye see that this is the true <26 of God; yea, ye see that
God will support, and keep, and <1348 us, so long as we are faithful
unto him, and unto our <15540 and our religion; and <808 will the Lord
<590 that we <569 be <8976 <2766 we <88 fall into
transgression and deny our <67

44:5 And now, <226 I <2118 you, in the name of that
all-powerful God, who has strengthened our arms that we have gained
<718 over you, by our <60 by our religion, and by our <706 of
worship, and by our <1428 and by the <8173 <2320 <200 we owe to
our <736 and our <736 by that <517 <13 binds us to our <1617
and our country; yea, and also by the maintenance of the <33 word of
God, to <24 we owe all our happiness; and by all that is most dear
unto us—

44:6 Yea, and this is not all; I <109 you by all the <4894 <33
ye have for <4146 that ye <8002 up your <2157 of war unto us, and
we will seek not your <1197 but we will spare your lives, if ye will
go your way and come not <1013 to war <308 us.

44:7 And now, if ye do not <11245 <509 ye are in our <385 and I
will <72 my men that they <208 fall upon you, and inflict the
wounds of <1204 in your bodies, that ye may <4009 extinct; and then we
will see who <26 have <194 over this <7950 yea, we will see who
<12 be <1319 into <391

44:8 And now it came to pass that when <564 had <7691 <748
sayings he came <760 and <367 up his <4402 and his cimeter, and
his bow into the <871 of <543 and said unto him: <466 here are
our <150 of war; we will <158 them up unto you, but we will not
<316 ourselves to take an oath unto you, <184 we know that we <80
break, and also our children; but take our <38 of war, and <27
that we may depart into the <15679 otherwise we will <9485 our
<2373 and we will <14469 or conquer.

44:9 <73 we are not of your faith; we do not <7146 that it is God
that has <111 us into your hands; but we <15 that it is your
cunning that has <10303 you from our swords. <39 it is your
<2390 and your <2385 that have <16 you.

44:10 And now when <162 had made an end of speaking <166 <5854
<646 <12508 the <162 and the <105 of war, <123 he had
received, unto <430 <9705 <47 we will end the conflict.

44:11 Now I <522 recall the <6071 <24 I have <6059 <1838 as
the Lord liveth, ye <153 not <136 <479 ye <3 with an oath that
ye will not <3215 <317 <315 us to war. Now as ye are in our <219
we will spill your <668 upon the <4669 or ye <38 submit to the
<4190 <55 I have proposed.

44:12 And now when <99 had said <105 <105 <114 <1454 his
<4607 and he was <669 with <261 and he rushed forward that he
<718 slay <2643 but as he <5348 his <22 <373 one of Moroni’s
soldiers smote it even to the <12121 and it broke by the hilt; and he
also <16 <50 that he took off his scalp and it fell to the
<8284 And <15 <823 from <1003 them into the <15784 of his
soldiers.

44:13 And it came to pass that the soldier who <11515 by, who <44 off
the <41 of <188 took up the <6 from off the ground by the
hair, and laid it upon the <3593 of his <94 and stretched it <392
unto <1284 saying unto them with a loud voice:

44:14 Even as this <39 has <4386 to the <109 <164 is the <9 of
your chief, so <179 ye fall to the <10353 <220 ye will <402 up
your <268 of war and <229 with a <3039 of <8064

44:15 Now <1780 were many, when they <464 <193 <264 and saw the
<46 <50 was upon the <82 that were <1008 with fear; and many
came <88 and threw down <995 <47 of war at the feet of <214
and <3092 into a <53 of <53 And as many as <10 into a
<11 they suffered to <71 into the <2252

44:16 Now it came to pass that <194 was <1605 wroth, and he
did stir up the <2107 of his <241 to anger, to <1939 more
powerfully <325 the <2676

44:17 And now <295 was <15769 <906 of the stubbornness of the
<3523 <368 he <1091 his <2397 that they <842 fall upon
them and slay <1067 And it came to pass that they <1261 to slay <1260
yea, and the <1248 did <56 with <119 <1917 and <3 might.

44:18 But <318 <8 naked skins and <4 bare heads were <1981
to the sharp <23 of the <1265 yea, <1002 they were pierced and
smitten, yea, and did fall <114 fast <309 the <20 of the
<21 and they <63 to be swept down, even as the <306 of
<107 had prophesied.

44:19 Now <306 when he saw that they were all <1222 to be
<4232 <1366 mightily unto <197 promising that he <1050 <185
and also his <126 with <306 if they <11 <812 the <169 of
<92 <816 that they <993 <11 come to war <496 <171 <138

44:20 And it came to pass that <67 <2501 that the work of <791
<164 <4148 <23 <1976 the <2646 And he took the <265 of war
from the <188 and <3770 they had <256 into a <70 with him
of <8659 they were <261 to <261 into the <261

44:21 Now the <1422 of <76 dead was not numbered <230 of the
greatness of the number; yea, the <17 of <17 dead was <163
great, both on the <1638 and on the <2070

44:22 And it came to pass that they did cast <27 dead into the <1493
of <1384 and they have gone <362 and are buried in the depths of the
sea.

44:23 And the <1415 of the <1400 or of <176 <701 and came
to <41 houses and <3 <13148

44:24 And thus <13351 the <3831 year of the <3861 of the <13351
over the <196 of <13351 And thus <18 the <11566 of <2852 <439 was
<16143 upon the <11403 of <16

Alma <1423 45

45:1 <743 now it came to pass that the <37 of Nephi were
<131 rejoiced, <148 the Lord had <201 <831 them out of
the <716 of <78 <3661 <385 they gave <9833 unto the Lord
<10 God; yea, and they did fast much and pray much, and they did
<1898 God with <43 <2056 joy.

45:2 And it came to pass in the nineteenth year of the <110 of the
<111 over the <73 of <3267 that Alma came unto his son Helaman
and said unto him: Believest thou the <563 <119 I <8994 unto thee
<4067 <2930 <11322 <9 have been kept?

45:3 And <28 said unto him: Yea, I believe.

45:4 And Alma said again: <37 thou in <8974 <6281 who <638
come?

45:5 And he <10677 Yea, I <955 all the <55 <46 thou hast <6952

45:6 And Alma said unto him <36 Will ye keep my commandments?

45:7 And he <32 Yea, I will keep thy <8658 with all my heart.

45:8 Then Alma said unto him: Blessed art thou; and the Lord <67
<9442 thee in this <9658

45:9 But <529 I have <5655 to <12554 unto <7801 but what I
<7 unto thee ye <28 not make known; yea, what I <11 unto
thee <11 not be made known, even <2405 the <4195 is <10614
<227 write the <106 <106 I <18 say.

45:10 And <735 are the words: <274 I <5713 that this very
<4272 the <345 <2742 to the <3866 of revelation <29 is in
me, in four hundred <3552 from the time that <167 <7058 <42
<10901 <5054 unto <533 <6 dwindle in unbelief.

45:11 Yea, and then <11 they see wars and pestilences, yea, famines
and bloodshed, even <83 the <255 of <328 <17 <1310 extinct—

45:12 Yea, and this <334 they <12 <40 in unbelief and fall
into the <4836 of <7264 and lasciviousness, and all <3573 of
<8279 yea, I say unto you, that <28 they <28 sin <585 so
<327 <8628 and knowledge, yea, I say unto you, that from that day,
even the fourth <11886 <23 not all pass away <686 this <25
<8392 <10 <3050

45:13 And when that <12 day cometh, <206 the time very soon <4730
that <325 who are now, or the seed of <8 who are now <578 <626
the <112 of <367 <39 no more be <11 <11 the <10 of
<472

45:14 But <4051 remaineth, and is not <1665 in that <54 and
<2772 day, <29 be <27 <27 the <2133 and <7 <148
like unto <182 all, save it be a few who <13 be <4038 the disciples
of the <5594 and them <11 the <838 pursue even <182 they <7
<32 extinct. And now, <147 of <7457 this <275 <11 be
fulfilled.

45:15 And now it came to pass that <710 Alma had said <278 <4734 to
<9800 he <9706 him, and also his <2629 sons; and he also <10
the <1061 for the righteous’ sake.

45:16 And he <398 Thus saith the Lord God—Cursed <55 be the <9996
yea, this <4 unto <2855 <12056 <12056 <12056 and <317 unto
<10666 <312 do wickedly, when they are <6071 <10853 and as I have
said so <33 it be; for this is the cursing and the blessing of God
upon the <42 for the Lord <1368 look upon sin with the <4776 <13184
of allowance.

45:17 And now, when Alma had said <110 <399 he <97 the <1797
yea, all <227 who <853 <2288 fast in the <1910 from that time
henceforth.

45:18 And when Alma had done this he <3636 out of the land of
<13960 as if to go into the land of Melek. And it came to pass that
he was <927 <1184 of <12960 as to his <910 or burial we know not of.

45:19 <461 this we <12421 that he was a <6247 man; and the <1275
went abroad in the <13345 that he was <6622 up by the Spirit, or <842
by the hand of the <5771 even as Moses. But <351 the <12300
<199 the Lord took <15890 unto himself; and we <3760 that he has also
<7848 Alma in the spirit, unto <15 <3347 for this <2134 we
know <12961 <703 his <87 and burial.

45:20 And now it came to pass in the <4700 of the <759
year of the <760 of the <759 over the <382 of <392 that <726
went <929 <365 the <10 to <4841 the word unto <1059

45:21 For <87 <339 of <827 wars with the <356 and the many
little dissensions and disturbances <276 had been <33 the <285 it
<3051 <5885 that the word of God <224 be declared <15 <405
yea, and that a regulation <11 be made <14650 the <2751

45:22 <3442 <71 and his <9497 went <73 to <3521 the
<172 <907 in all the <297 yea, in <340 city <28 all the
land <62 was possessed by the <95 of <486 And it came to pass
that they did appoint <4356 and <14671 <26 all the <34
over all the churches.

45:23 And now it came to pass that <437 <67 and his <67 had
<4237 <31 and <31 over the churches that <1467 <13712 a
<16623 <105 <105 and they <1214 not give heed to the <352 of
<32 and his <6568

45:24 But they grew proud, <3236 <9723 up in <165 <15502 <169 of
<5 <980 <562 riches; <782 they grew rich in <9 own
<9154 and <44 not give heed to <10 <1712 to walk uprightly <652
God.

Alma <1072 46

46:1 And it came to pass that as many as <32 not <14840 to the <75
of <75 and his <107 were <2643 <2643 <715 <43
brethren.

46:2 And now <244 they were <73 <1504 <2665 that they
were determined to slay <263

46:3 Now the <3080 of <461 who were wroth <36 <36 <42 was
a <4594 and a strong man; and his name was Amalickiah.

46:4 And Amalickiah was desirous to be a king; and <33 <217 who
were <35 were also <14 that he <268 be <41 <16 and they
were the <4234 part of them the lower <350 of the <226 and they
were <13990 for power.

46:5 And they had been led by the flatteries of Amalickiah, that if
they <135 <2346 him and <298 him to be <50 king that he <12
make them <14949 over the <1414

46:6 Thus they were led away by <93 to dissensions,
<4309 the preaching of <165 and his <3870 yea,
<10 <37 <153 <226 care over the <604 for they
were high <284 over the <367

46:7 And <286 were many in the <362 who believed in the flattering
<208 of <85 <258 they <4712 even from the church; and
thus were the affairs of the <150 of <976 <53 precarious and
dangerous, <60 <60 <59 victory <384 they had had over
the <846 and <12 <12 rejoicings <12 they had had <308 of
<10 deliverance by the hand of the <6264

46:8 Thus we see how quick the <9094 of men do forget the Lord <25
God, yea, how <14 to do <850 and to be led away by the evil one.

46:9 Yea, and we also see the <62 <7140 one very <5179 man can
<600 to take <7043 <407 the <49 of men.

46:10 Yea, we see that <125 <82 he was a man of <2226
device and a man of many <144 <382 that he led away the <3122
of many <135 to do <9329 yea, and to seek to <2708 the <171
of God, and to <8 the <5773 of <2584 <133 God had <6709
unto <473 or <8 <851 God had sent upon the face of the land for
the <921 <921

46:11 And now it came to pass that when <1564 who was the <3464
commander of the <1579 of the <1234 had <801 of <863
<275 he was <2174 with <381

46:12 And it came to pass that he rent his coat; and he took a piece
thereof, and wrote upon it—In <12850 of our God, our <2704 and
<3160 and our <8601 our <5214 and our children—and he fastened it
upon the end of a pole.

46:13 And he <15 on his head-plate, and his breastplate, and his
shields, and <4704 on his armor <1846 his <4707 and he took the pole,
<135 had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he <1121 it the title
of liberty) and he bowed <1325 to the <2145 and he <18066 <1877
unto his God for the <15673 of <181 to rest upon his <397 so
long as <377 <488 a band of Christians <8545 to <12059 the land—

46:14 For thus were all the true believers of <1545 who belonged to
the <230 of God, <68 by <532 who did not belong to the <424

46:15 And <13 who did <12 to the <24 were faithful; yea, all
<12 who were true <42 in <1420 took upon <252 gladly, the
name of <51 or <71 as they were <9504 <318 of <374
belief in <22 who <88 <1336

46:16 And <954 at this <6986 <1951 <121 that the <359 of the
Christians, and the <3399 of the land <2412 be favored.

46:17 And it came to pass that when he had poured out his soul to God,
he named all the land <190 was <4186 of the land Desolation, yea, and
in fine, all the <626 both on the <4251 and on the south—A chosen
<11 and the land of liberty.

46:18 And he <1261 Surely God <1225 not <2699 that we, who are
<18193 <111 we take upon us the name of <126 <18 be <16418
down and <2105 <1351 we <3213 it upon us by our own
<11434

46:19 And when <125 had said <366 <451 he went <971 <484 the
<1012 waving the rent part of his garment in the air, that all <134
see the writing <111 he had <1932 upon the rent part, and crying
with a loud voice, <2672

46:20 <1198 <1467 will maintain this <312 upon the <114 let
them come <55 in the <3946 of the <1182 and <8921 into a <2117
that they will <26 <221 <3694 and <3 <408 that the Lord
God may <10533 <856

46:21 And it came to pass that when <103 had proclaimed <103 <103
<887 the <548 came running <903 with <34 <399 <403 <400
<5 loins, rending <3 <16154 in token, or as a covenant, that
they <791 not <10141 the Lord <16 God; or, in <1469 <38 if they
<285 <12976 the <1850 of God, or fall into transgression,
and be ashamed to take upon them the name of <195 the Lord <24
rend them even as they had rent <42 garments.

46:22 Now this was the <119 <164 they <17406 and they cast <17
<76 at the feet of <585 <163 We <17 with our God, that
we <240 be <236 even as our <972 in the land northward, if
we <14 fall into transgression; yea, he may cast us at the feet of
our <18456 even as we have cast our <51 at thy feet to be
<281 <14046 foot, if we <34 fall into transgression.

46:23 <169 said unto <18400 <227 we are a remnant of the seed of
<15140 yea, we are a <11 of the seed of Joseph, <4553 coat was rent
by his <82 into many pieces; yea, and now <202 let us <10780
to keep the <167 of God, or our <72 <61 be rent by our
<561 and we be cast into <14101 or be sold, or be slain.

46:24 Yea, let us <3457 our <588 as a <65 of Joseph; yea, let
us <49 the <955 of Jacob, <1193 his <7306 for <61 he saw
that a part of the <25 of the coat of Joseph was <3051 and had
not decayed. And he said—Even as this <18 of <383 of my son hath
been preserved, so <85 a <13 of the seed of my son be <32
by the hand of God, and be <1556 unto <6296 <14670 the <2535 of
the seed of <54 <31 perish, even as the <34 of his garment.

46:25 Now <83 this giveth my soul sorrow; <3903 my soul
hath joy in my son, <503 of that part of his seed <284 <37 be
<52 unto God.

46:26 Now <34 this was the language of Jacob.

46:27 And now who <9539 but what the <61 of the seed of <216
<37 <37 <3236 as his garment, are <687 who have <1109 from
us? Yea, and even it <17 be <3299 if we do not <1753 fast in the
<1754 of <3690

46:28 And now it came to pass that when <287 had said <456 <198 he
went <8933 and also sent <509 in all the <4674 of the land <4889
<806 were <944 and <1375 <472 all the <478 who were
<1308 to <517 <397 <4149 to <60 <1352 <1239 and
<83 who had dissented, who were <803 Amalickiahites.

46:29 And it came to pass that when <22 saw that the <38 of
<71 were more numerous than the Amalickiahites—and he also saw that
his <16 were doubtful <1721 the <6647 of the <772 in <139
they had undertaken—therefore, fearing that he <488 not gain the
point, he took <65 of his <29 who <539 and <1869 into the land
of <1619

46:30 Now <58 <5131 it was not <1690 that the <1711 <36
have any more <10478 <1290 he <16 to cut off the <38 of
<1176 or to take them and <734 them back, and put <101 to
<14485 yea, for he knew that he <60 stir up the <42 to <4328
<142 <900 and <94 them to come to <3995 <9 <2966 and this
he knew that <35 <26 do that he <740 <10861 his purposes.

46:31 <4154 <85 <69 it was <84 that he <83 take his
armies, who had <202 <5266 <15772 and <5755 <4418 and
<2842 into a <589 to keep the peace—and it came to pass that he
took his army and <5463 out with his tents into the <5555 to
cut off the <5250 of <70 in the <2863

46:32 And it came to pass that he did <2445 to his desires, and
<37 <281 into the <34 and headed the <1229 of <1217

46:33 And it came to pass that <43 fled with a <12383 <2884 of
his men, and the <450 were <2750 up into the <2748 of <119
and were <415 back into the land of Zarahemla.

46:34 Now, <16 <1767 a man who was <1810 by the <1292 <1615 and
the <4447 of the <914 <223 he had <3772 <85 to his will
with the <78 of the <1307 to <1606 and to <12435 authority
over <858

46:35 And it came to pass that whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that
<206 not <898 into a <173 to <1640 the <230 of <1299 that
they <217 <387 a free government, he <3062 to be put to <265
and <414 were but few who denied the <31 of freedom.

46:36 And it came to pass <5825 that he <30 the <965 of <668 to
be hoisted upon <1978 tower <376 was in all the <977 <6 was
<1980 by the <3198 and thus <136 <19590 the standard of
<29 <1043 the <3310

46:37 And they <3214 to have <3102 <2022 in the <5541 and thus they did
<91 <11 in the land <1095 nearly the end of the <2139 year
of the <2139 of the <6870

46:38 And <1728 and the high <1713 did also <32 <6923 in the
<1691 yea, even for the <8183 of four <2704 did they have much <49
and rejoicing in the <1313

46:39 And it came to pass that <145 were many who died, firmly
believing that <553 <7080 were <8912 by the Lord <2737 <9618 thus
they went out of the world rejoicing.

46:40 And <32 were some who died with fevers, <144 at some seasons
of the year were very frequent in the <14105 not so much so with
<21 <730 of the excellent qualities of the many plants and roots
<33 God had <5550 to remove the <244 of diseases, to <11 men
were <5721 by the <8786 of the climate—

46:41 But <67 were many who died with old age; and <579 who died in
the <710 of <1394 are happy in him, as we must <10485 suppose.

Alma <2088 47

47:1 Now we will <3865 in our <3188 to <412 and <38 who had
fled with him into the <4026 for, <808 he had <404 <15 who
went with him, and went up in the land of <1884 <264 the <1870
and did stir up the <586 to <586 <576 the <619 of <2373
<2106 that the king of the <15 sent a proclamation <2266
all his <313 <33 all his <426 that they <574 <5978 <568
<772 <295 to go to <613 <37 the <313

47:2 And it came to pass that when the <37 had gone <530
<36 them they were <1957 afraid; yea, they feared to displease
the king, and they also <9 to go to <42 <42 the <3404
lest they <58 lose <265 lives. And it came to pass that they <457
not, or the more part of them <9 not, obey the <1117 of the
king.

47:3 And now it came to pass that the king was <2173 <256 of <44
<8228 <535 he gave <180 the <4342 of that part of
his army <251 was obedient unto his commands, and <3718 him that
he <74 go <106 and compel them to arms.

47:4 Now <202 this was the <4733 of Amalickiah; for he <599 a very
subtle man to do evil <56 he laid the plan in his <11402 to
dethrone the king of the <3524

47:5 And now he had got the <77 of <244 <971 of the <210 who
were in <17100 of the <2266 and he sought to gain <9 of <20 who
were not obedient; <54 he went <4100 to the <2054 <104 was
<971 Onidah, for thither had all the <39 fled; for they
discovered the army coming, and, supposing that they were <5817 to
<2025 <863 <36 they fled to <29 to the <37 of <123

47:6 And they had <710 a man to be a king and a <2391 over <29
<129 fixed in <182 <11261 with a <2412 resolution that they <216
not be <17784 to go <249 the <291

47:7 And it came to pass that they had <883 <315 <314
upon the top of the mount <102 was <101 Antipas, in preparation to
battle.

47:8 Now it was not Amalickiah’s <6199 to give them <297
<774 to the <271 of the <153 but <213 it was his
<19 to gain <157 with the <786 of the <409 that he <748
<117 <1983 at <94 head and <210 the king and take <6404
of the kingdom.

47:9 And <40 it came to pass that he <742 his army to pitch <30
<948 in the <6335 <90 was near the <95 Antipas.

47:10 And it came to pass that when it was <9530 he sent a <13711
embassy into the <24 <116 <6598 that the <170 of <240 who
were upon the mount, <1515 name was Lehonti, that he <332 come down
to the foot of the <16 for he <7940 to <14374 with him.

47:11 And it came to pass that when Lehonti <2937 the <6549 he
<6772 not go down to the foot of the mount. And it came to pass that
<405 sent <512 the <11151 <2000 <75 him to come down. And
it came to pass that <41 <240 not; and he sent <22 the <11169
<15558

47:12 And it came to pass that when <40 <6338 that he <7776 not
get <30 to come down off from the <97 he went up into the <6
<853 to Lehonti’s <6750 and he sent <46 the <3425 time his <95
unto <132 <73 that he <63 come <4103 and that he <6 <1239
his guards with him.

47:13 And it came to pass that when <58 had come down with his
<21 to <1271 that <77 <157 him to come down with his
army in the night-time, and surround <196 men in <240 camps over whom
the king had <8458 him <7167 and that he <61 <4393 them up into
<90 <4906 if he <10 make him (Amalickiah) a <160 <231 over
the <12800 army.

47:14 And it came to pass that <75 came down with his men and
<16065 the men of <78 so that <1697 they awoke at the dawn
of day they were <18 by the <356 of Lehonti.

47:15 And it came to pass that when they saw that they were surrounded,
they plead with <117 that he <78 <2147 them to fall in with
<110 <1784 that they <389 not be <7501 Now this was the very
<9386 <359 <27 desired.

47:16 And it came to pass that he <1257 his men, <9705 to the
commands of the <713 Now this was the <30 that <30 desired,
that he <47 accomplish his <7762 in dethroning the <19

47:17 Now it was the custom <798 the <458 if <72 <1270 <154
was killed, to <3120 the <162 <8 to be <13 <13 <7878

47:18 And it came to pass that <52 <454 that one of his
servants <402 <17579 poison by degrees to <279 that he died.

47:19 Now, when <186 was <11502 the <652 <617 <30 to
be <47 <51 and <3 <50 commander.

47:20 And it came to pass that <20 <1412 with his <187 (for
he had <5310 his desires) to the land of <947 to the city of <5
<156 was the <38 city.

47:21 And the king came out to meet him with his guards, for he
supposed that <48 had <15002 his <835 and that
<8 had <650 <649 so <2811 an army to go <673 the
<923 to <645

47:22 But <587 as the king came out to meet him <30 <136
that his <134 <134 go <868 to meet the <188 And they went and
<2618 <696 <303 the <973 as if to reverence him <920 of his
greatness.

47:23 And it came to pass that the king put <38 his hand to <16129
<765 as was the <223 with the <223 as a token of <2731 <128
<11 they had <1118 from the <764

47:24 And it came to pass that when he had <4951 the <6118 from the
<5006 <4618 he stabbed the king to the <8432 and he fell to the
<4933

47:25 Now the <110 of the king <878 and the <7 of <124
<39 a cry, <2270

47:26 <2206 the <14 of the king have <45 him to the heart,
and he has <4894 and they have <35 <164 come and see.

47:27 And it came to pass that <45 <1037 that his <255
<169 march <131 and see what had happened to the <823 and when they
had come to the spot, and <634 the king lying in his gore, <34
pretended to be <3330 and <2603 Whosoever loved the <192 let him go
<2000 and <3939 his <87 that they may be <2233

47:28 And it came to pass that all they who <30 the <30 when they
<2961 <2035 <2453 came <75 and <6623 <3506 the <34 of the
<249

47:29 Now when the <12 of the king saw an army pursuing <22
<227 they were frightened <6286 and fled into the <1781 and
came over into the land of Zarahemla and joined the <1320 of Ammon.

47:30 And the army <246 <58 <36 them returned, <7010 <5
<6 them in vain; and thus <611 by his fraud, <406 the
<3121 of the <3332

47:31 And it came to pass on the morrow he <1902 the city <1386 with
his <1920 and took <965 of the <421

47:32 And now it came to pass that the queen, when she had <131 that
the king was slain—for <183 had sent an <943 to the queen
informing her that the king had been <6418 by his servants, that he had
<93 them with his army, but it was in <19255 and they had made <523
escape—

47:33 <3749 when the <41 had <937 this <842 she sent unto
<118 <844 him that he <690 <4900 the <150 of the <17832
and she also <820 him that he <288 come in unto her; and she also
<13 him that he <13 <867 witnesses with him to <19241
<2186 the <3907 of the <228

47:34 And it came to pass that <114 took the same <15259 that
slew the <265 and all them who were with him, and went in unto the
<148 unto the <1143 <2296 she sat; and they all <20855 unto her
that the king was <139 by his own servants; and they said also: They
have <399 does not this <75 <578 them?  And thus they satisfied
the <133 <84 the <84 of the <84

47:35 And it came to pass that <84 <1373 the <1215 of the
<68 and took her unto him to wife; and thus by his <275 and by the
assistance of his <3415 <207 he obtained the kingdom; yea, he
was acknowledged king <1628 all the <1627 <793 all the <179 of
the <575 who were composed of the <748 and the Lemuelites
and the Ishmaelites, and all the dissenters of the <2062 from the
<1917 of <308 down to the <16628 <1116

47:36 Now <422 dissenters, <357 the same instruction and the same
information of the <30 yea, <13 been instructed in the same
<13165 of the <2976 <2584 it is strange to relate, not long
<387 <283 <4065 they <4056 more <20920 and impenitent, and
more wild, <3551 and ferocious than the Lamanites—drinking in with the
traditions of the <5132 giving way to indolence, and all <4604 of
lasciviousness; yea, entirely forgetting the Lord <41 God.

Alma <1832 48

48:1 And now it came to pass <19539 as soon as <186 had <158
the <7604 he <2065 to inspire the <449 of the <144 <227 the
<158 of Nephi; yea, he did <949 men to <1313 unto the <16
from <55 towers, <20 the <734

48:2 And thus he did <37 <14 <37 <14 the <137
<1838 that in the latter end of the <2095 year of the <177 of
the <10911 he <155 accomplished his <1024 thus far, yea, <7
been made king over the <221 he <272 also to <25 over all the
<239 yea, and all the <82 who were in the <10 the <894 as
well as the <1699

48:3 <2464 he had <49 his design, for he had <185 the
<82 of the <103 and blinded <89 minds, and stirred them up to
<5527 <92 that he had <947 <947 a <2637 host to go to
<1574 <110 the <124

48:4 For he was determined, <912 of the <5304 of the <2417 of
his <1947 to <19164 the <77 and to <480 them into <6137

48:5 And thus he did <175 <1030 <7172 of the <8610 they
<1688 the most acquainted with the <3266 of the <165 and <82
places of resort, and the weakest <1798 of <10 cities; <1741 he
<1110 them to be <37 <37 over his armies.

48:6 And it came to pass that they took <26 camp, and moved <776
toward the land of <737 in the <2553

48:7 Now it came to pass that <2964 <279 had thus been obtaining
<2474 by fraud and deceit, <3202 on the <3267 <7548 had been
preparing the <1777 of the <203 to be <6523 unto the Lord <56
God.

48:8 Yea, he had been strengthening the <920 of the <110 and
erecting <2572 forts, or <113 of resort; throwing up banks of <4775
<7995 <3342 to enclose his <761 and also building walls of stone to
encircle them <6882 <17 <17 <51 cities and the <7840 of <6
lands; yea, all <13 <13 the <5165

48:9 And in <15 <158 fortifications he did <631 the <4210
<215 of men; and thus he did fortify and strengthen the land <862
was <2486 by the <248

48:10 And thus he was <120 to <2565 <39 <2943 <2 <7096
<3 <3862 and <3 <6551 and <3 <1139 and that they <1390
live unto the Lord <11 God, and that they <11 <2462 that <48
was <1890 by <13 enemies the <2358 of Christians.

48:11 And <2541 was a <4331 and a <20351 man; he was a man of a
<11864 understanding; yea, a man that did not delight in bloodshed; a
man <1802 soul did joy in the <2570 and the <3737 of his <7243
and his <3326 from <8119 and slavery;

48:12 Yea, a man <28 <2119 did <21306 with <19565 to his God,
for the many privileges and <3894 <89 he <21660 upon his
<6504 a man who did <19894 <2282 for the <20247 and safety of
his <996

48:13 Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the <2441 of <3527 and he
had sworn with an oath to <7334 his <411 his <3631 and his
<89 and his <3635 even to the loss of his <6999

48:14 Now the <430 were <21247 to <29 <1370 <461 <165
<3496 even to the <7065 of <6315 if it were necessary; yea, and
they were also <24 <4926 to give an <7443 yea, and <7 to <1370
the <6412 <6149 it were <37 an enemy, <6 it were to <3431
<45 <2370

48:15 And this was <9 <6826 that by so <7516 God <1004 <5477 them
in the <583 or in <398 <1212 if they were <390 in <14175 the
<2112 of God that he <24 <24 them in the <2762 yea, warn
them to flee, or to <13461 for war, <2137 to <50 danger;

48:16 And <2836 that God <29 make it <7745 unto them <8648 they
<1038 go to <129 <129 <92 <25 <128 and by so doing,
the Lord <24 <1859 <3127 and this was the <189 of <478 and his
<247 did glory in it; not in the <153 of <153 but in <105 <11866
in preserving his <200 yea, in <96 the <95 of God, yea,
and resisting <15824

48:17 Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had <12589 and
<9595 and ever <66 be, like unto <61 <1445 the very powers of
hell <12 have been shaken forever; yea, the <12815 <8 <198 have
<564 over the <722 of the <4447 of men.

48:18 <1498 he was a man like unto <19150 the son of <18671 yea, and
even the <188 sons of <9 yea, and also Alma and his sons, for
they were all men of God.

48:19 Now <73 <2924 and his <395 were no less serviceable
unto the <612 than was <6556 for they did <9996 the word of God,
and they did baptize unto <10435 all men <4004 <92 <4857
unto <191 <9964

48:20 And thus they went <1502 and the <39 did <15957 <209
<789 of <20 <270 <818 that they were highly favored of the
<1046 and thus they were free from wars and <19155 <1125
<3310 yea, even for the <2992 of four years.

48:21 But, as I have <16557 in the <947 end of the <947 year,
yea, <4694 <52 <3009 amongst <32 they were
<10274 reluctantly to <6348 with <12 <2029 the <915

48:22 Yea, and in <4225 <12 wars <193 did <6226 for the <55 of
many <3048 with the <966 <40 <16 much reluctance.

48:23 Now, they were sorry to take up arms <319 the <19
<113 they did not <586 in the <299 of <21196 yea, and this
was not all—they were <27 to be the <8888 of sending so many of <47
<195 out of this <3059 into an <10426 <10850 unprepared to meet
<15 God.

48:24 <8012 they <2328 not <2136 to lay down <14 <6345 that
<4 <7258 and <3 <282 <394 be massacred by the barbarous
cruelty of <2264 who were once <15 <126 yea, and had <3750
from <8 <4895 and had left them and had gone to <2682 them by
joining the <147

48:25 Yea, they <59 not bear that <27 <85 <50 <17380 over
the <411 of the <870 so long as <3079 were any who <16 keep
the <412 of God, for the promise of the Lord was, if they
<17 keep his <16 they <5 <520 in the <855

Alma <1251 49

49:1 And now it came to pass in the eleventh month of the <245
<246 on the tenth day of the month, the <941 of the <1134 were
seen approaching <8315 the land of Ammonihah.

49:2 And <379 the city had been rebuilt, and <822 had stationed an
army by the <932 of the <9077 and they had cast up dirt <20994 <935
to shield them from the arrows and the <9441 of the <1359 for
<42 they fought with <10 and with arrows.

49:3 <474 I said that the city of Ammonihah had been rebuilt. I say
unto you, yea, that it was in part rebuilt; and <288 the <95
had <5895 it once <8 of the <5962 of the <583 they
<2187 that it <443 <2560 <5864 an easy prey for <3556

49:4 But <69 how <2190 was <211 disappointment; for <7 the
<789 had dug up a ridge of <1070 <1039 <104 <1904 <874 was so
high that the <59 <240 not cast <28 <98 and <3 <114 at
them that they <987 take effect, <7789 <17 they come upon them
save it was by <21 <1063 of entrance.

49:5 Now at this time the <1225 <1225 of the <45 were
astonished exceedingly, <103 of the <16406 of the <74 in
<1062 <32 <1149 of security.

49:6 Now the leaders of the <28 had supposed, <26 of the
<1328 of <22 numbers, yea, they <130 that they <284 be
privileged to come upon them as they had <12302 <16180 yea, and they
had also <3432 <573 with <4937 and with breastplates; and
they had also <12 <12 with <4338 of skins, yea, very
<9707 <7 to cover <51 nakedness.

49:7 And <1354 thus <22 they <58 that they <58 easily
<1389 and <3464 <20 <388 to the yoke of <19576 or slay
and massacre them <864 to <15 pleasure.

49:8 But <196 to <9 uttermost astonishment, they were <40
for <193 in a <1640 <196 <572 had been <876 <633 the <480 of
<8125 Now they were <21 for the <557 to <1471 <1694 the
<24 of the instructions of <8666

49:9 And it came to pass that the <23 or the Amalickiahites,
were <1104 <188 at <61 <27 of <3095 for war.

49:10 Now, if king <1393 had come down out of the land of <2516
at the head of his <2044 <19270 he <311 have <2462 the <201 to
have attacked the <224 at the city of Ammonihah; for <112 he did
care not for the <523 of his <1158

49:11 But <17 <54 did not come down <3117 to <2518 And
<11 his <276 <276 <3006 not <9577 the <43 at the city of
Ammonihah, for <463 had altered the management of <5451 <144 the
<566 <800 that the <71 were disappointed in <111 <289
of retreat and they <338 not come upon <394

49:12 <1668 they retreated into the <2273 and took <24 camp
and <2653 <527 the land of Noah, <3324 that to be the next
best <362 for them to come <749 the <1410

49:13 For they knew not that <77 had fortified, or had built forts
of security, for <3931 city in all the land <435 about; <5095
they <53 <3396 to the land of Noah with a firm determination;
yea, <70 <127 <127 came <16 and took an oath that they <184
<708 the <925 of that <2290

49:14 But <152 to <26 <291 the city of <92 <286 had
<378 been a weak place, had now, by the <814 of <1081 <529
strong, yea, even to exceed the <1706 of the city <647

49:15 And now, <42 this was <459 in <1017 for he had <374
that they <68 be <2433 at the city <243 and as the city of
Noah had <59 been the <1578 part of the <1277 <1736 they
<26 <2564 <3505 to battle; and thus it was <391 to his
<10589

49:16 And <58 <160 had <1758 Lehi to be <130 <10244 over
the men of that <2319 and it was that same Lehi who <685 with the
<249 in the <3367 on the east of the <8498 <8561

49:17 And now <2708 it came to <9989 that when the <25 had <2616
that Lehi <2646 the city they were <670 disappointed, for they
<3773 Lehi <9073 nevertheless <170 <66 <196 had <1480
with an oath to <328 the <69 <225 they <8024 up <17
<1838

49:18 Now <97 the <47 <311 not get into <15 <258 of
security by any <1220 way save by the entrance, <608 of the highness
of the bank <217 had been thrown up, and the depth of the ditch <11
had been dug <283 <1772 save it were by the <684

49:19 And thus were the <401 <522 to <271 all such as <584
attempt to climb up to <4309 the fort by any <65 way, by <23102 over
<744 and <743 at <393

49:20 Thus they were <16512 yea, a body of <95 strongest men, with
<5 <7472 and <3 slings, to <9098 down all who <50 <49 to
come into <13 <397 of <115 by the <5 of entrance; and thus
were they <76 to <1477 <683 <409 the <1053

49:21 And it came to pass that the <178 of the <156 <169 up
<39 <984 <2999 the <37 of <149 and <2248 to <1234 with
the <499 to get into <18 <15 of security; but <185 they
were <8831 back from time to <3523 <517 that they were <2513 with
an immense slaughter.

49:22 Now when they <255 that they <212 not <4655 <1454 over the
<162 by the <274 they <57 to dig down <51 <1979 of <909 that
they <888 <22 a pass to <12 <1982 that they <9 have an equal
chance to fight; but <71 in <2442 attempts they were <7616 off by
the <182 and <182 <231 were <241 at <1598 and instead of filling
up <38 ditches by pulling down the <55 of <5740 they were <16031
up in a measure with <18 dead and wounded bodies.

49:23 Thus the <88 had all <95 over <16 <7374 and thus the
<163 did <205 to <262 the <17 <4453 <14 <354
<177 were all slain; yea, and more than a thousand of the <23
were <12 while, on the <272 <2143 <1238 was not a single soul of
the <35 <93 was <2992

49:24 There were <1045 fifty who were wounded, who had been <7769 to
the <115 of the <43 <16243 the <165 but they were <9690 by
<68 <951 and <3 <9402 and <3 <9414 <210
that <5 <8475 were upon <4 legs, many of <53 were very severe.

49:25 And it came to <38 that when the <45 saw that <23 <106
<106 were all <242 they fled into the <2264 And it came to
pass that they <7600 to the land of <864 to inform <28 <2810
<2878 who was a Nephite by birth, <2760 <11 <1165 loss.

49:26 And it came to pass that he was <918 <6051 with his
<1205 <475 he had not <2582 his <4201 over the <4666 he
had not <4060 them to the yoke of <2410

49:27 Yea, he was <34 <3171 and he did <17886 God, and also
<708 swearing with an oath that he <656 <13900 his <1547 and this
<52 <644 had kept the <1413 of God in <1161 for the
<2088 of his <929

49:28 And it came to <144 that on the <225 <225 the <785 of <2776
did <16272 the Lord <113 God, <42 of his matchless <280 in
delivering them from the <4913 of <15 <9467

49:29 And thus <7721 the <1444 year of the <2611 of the <4904
over the <44 of <5146

49:30 Yea, and <279 was continual <1706 <962 <1116 and <116
<166 prosperity in the <6020 <57 of <46 heed and <16215
<237 they gave unto the word of God, <8 was <6855 unto them by
<7203 and <16799 and Corianton, and <11224 and his <1610 yea,
and by all <1621 who had been ordained by the holy <4788 of God, <1218
baptized unto <11829 and sent <2528 to <1866 <68 the <143

Alma <1561 50

50:1 And now it came to pass that <176 did not stop making
<11668 for war, or to <596 his <114 <597 the <1504
for he <1136 that his <584 <631 <10671 in the <7013 of
the twentieth year of the <144 of the <2779 that they <18
<19 in digging up heaps of <540 <731 <404 all the cities,
<3013 all the land <124 was <2466 by the <1056

50:2 And upon the top of <542 ridges of <29 he <61 that <175
<43 be timbers, yea, <7540 of timbers <1067 up to the height of a
man, <50 <50 the cities.

50:3 And he <30 that upon <155 <26 of <26 <35 <34 be a
frame of pickets <34 upon the <12 <29 <1093 and they were
<2475 and high.

50:4 And he <34 towers to be erected that overlooked <38 <38 of
pickets, and he <14 <1198 of <760 to be <39 upon <15
<2944 that the <629 and the <515 of the <470 <688 not hurt
<818

50:5 And they were <778 that they <15 cast <24 from the top
<6463 <1033 to <280 pleasure and <3 strength, and slay him
who <95 <616 to approach near the <2678 of the <1150

50:6 Thus <229 did <2320 strongholds <219 the <4560 of <30
<2297 <110 <139 <1211 city in all the <1826

50:7 And it came to pass that <29 <100 that his <239 <49 go
<289 into the east <4902 yea, and they went <9 and drove all
the <103 who were in the east <11033 into <52 own <2676
<232 were <6302 of the land of <5325

50:8 And the land of <452 did run in a <17576 <5415 from the east
sea to the west.

50:9 And it came to pass that when <77 had <872 all the <59
out of the east <1364 <54 was <6340 of the <9273 of <65 own
possessions, he <100 that the inhabitants who were in the land of
<2915 and in the land <135 <135 <114 go <104 into the east
<38 even to the <1900 by the seashore, and <6537 the <148

50:10 And he also <10675 <142 on the south, in the <22 of <58
<57 and <57 them to erect <2845 that they <900
secure <14 <23 and <3 <417 from the <557 of <6 <557

50:11 And thus he cut off all the <216 of the <111 in the
east <72 yea, and also on the west, fortifying the line <12187
the <831 and the <1631 <7 the land of <107 and the
land of <747 from the west sea, <6302 by the head of the <1279
Sidon—the <28 possessing all the land <6203 yea, even all the
land <162 was northward of the land Bountiful, <314 to <83
<1739

50:12 Thus <717 with his <1009 <21 did increase daily <612 of
the assurance of protection <11 his <390 did <3167 <167 unto <635
did seek to cut off the <1446 and the <690 of the <111 from
off the <215 of <51 <156 that they <196 have no <17 upon
the <13 of <13 possession.

50:13 And it came to pass that the <98 <1093 the <6943 of a
<2111 and they <2960 the name of the city <1485 and it was by the
east sea; and it was on the <330 by the line of the possessions of the
<1216

50:14 And they also <47 a <47 for a city <176 the city of
<319 and the city of Aaron, <2296 the <252 of Aaron and <55
and they <65 the name of the <73 or the <1522 Nephihah.

50:15 And they also <44 in that same year to build many <3142 on the
north, one in a particular <1853 <164 they <37 <10887 <4 was in
the <365 by the <55 of the seashore.

50:16 And thus <841 the <697 year.

50:17 And in <661 prosperous circumstances were the <312 of <435 in
the <720 of the <11819 and <4243 year of the <721 of the
<866 over the <22 of <865

50:18 And they did <2356 <2114 and they <3647 <864
rich; yea, and they did multiply and wax <653 in the <397

50:19 And thus we see how <13326 and just are all the dealings of the
<2649 to the <19312 of all his <6183 unto the <2014 of men; yea,
we can <1606 that his <13 are verified, even at this <1368 <130 he
<8551 unto <136 <4295

50:20 <8461 art thou and thy <9529 and they <6253 be blessed,
<17902 as they <7 keep my <1040 they <5 <97 in the
<83 But <13637 <16 as they will not keep my <17 they
<18 be cut off from the <13119 of the <7358

50:21 And we see that <169 <19522 have been verified to the <149
of <3705 for it has been <339 quarrelings and <3 contentions, yea,
<4 murderings, and <3 <19348 <2 idolatry, <2
whoredoms, and <4 <19151 <102 were <963 <2737 <4
<1512 upon them <11 wars and <3 destructions.

50:22 And <793 who were <3076 in <2980 the <82 of the
Lord were <4757 at all times, whilst <19533 of <27 <3841
<2217 have been <13578 to <2217 or to <6402 by the <9259 or
to <8457 in <24720 and mingle with the <370

50:23 But <182 <894 <2211 was a happier time <75 the <107 of
<540 since the days of <5 than in the days of <508 yea, even
at this <202 in the <292 and <292 year of the <292 of the <5887

50:24 And it came to pass that the <21 and <4798 year of the <21
of the <313 also <349 in peace; yea, and also the <19 and <5117
<357

50:25 And it came to pass that in the <352 of the <20 and
<5092 year of the <40 of the <1074 <102 <1299 also have been
<1209 <103 the <103 of <381 had it not been for a contention <188
took <1679 <16 them <1390 the land of <299 and the land of
Morianton, <17 <4431 upon the <437 of Lehi; both of <9 were on
the <10 by the <447

50:26 For <1641 the <52 who <1114 the land of Morianton did
<13029 a part of the land of <35 <2035 <79 <507 to be a warm
<68 <552 <654 <1522 that the <31 of <27 took up
arms <980 <234 <1262 and they were <5502 by the <3378 to
slay <1043

50:27 But <59 the <28 who <59 the land of Lehi fled to the
camp of <213 and <24496 unto him for assistance; for <244 they
were not in the wrong.

50:28 And it came to pass that when the <41 of <128 who were
led by a man <3570 name was <11 <1801 that the <17 of Lehi
had fled to the camp of <55 they were <526 <16013 lest the
army of <658 <740 come upon them and <1717 <93

50:29 <4472 <117 put it into <115 <3287 that they <20
flee to the land <180 was <839 <3 was covered with <8019
<15721 of water, and take <4573 of the land <15 was northward.

50:30 And <133 they <252 have carried this plan into <2745 (which
<9 have been a <3730 to have been lamented) but <21 <62
<1419 a man of much passion, <203 he was <1632 with one of his
maid <4372 and he fell upon her and beat her much.

50:31 And it came to pass that she fled, and came over to the camp of
<133 and told <126 all <8702 <302 the matter, and also
<6 <119 intentions to flee into the land <96

50:32 Now <75 the <171 who were in the land <954 or <16260
<38 <2227 that they <101 <3349 to the <649 of <96 and
unite with his <1719 and thus he <16 <1979 <142 of <537
<4082 of the <824 <146 <11 lay a <862 for serious
consequences <375 the <51 of <488 yea, <15 <8 <16
lead to the overthrow of <79 <7507

50:33 <2556 <96 sent an <2658 with <12 <4094 to head the
<31 of <259 to stop <11 flight into the land <100

50:34 And it came to pass that they did not head them <1967 they had
come to the <414 of the land Desolation; and <391 they did head
<387 by the narrow pass <76 led by the sea into the land <261
yea, by the sea, on the west and on the east.

50:35 And it came to pass that the army <33 was sent by <158 <5
was led by a man <354 name was Teancum, did meet the <101 of
Morianton; and so stubborn were the <9 of <110 (being
<11152 by his <8077 and his <8041 words) that a <2850
<11786 <472 <85 in the <45 Teancum did slay <198 and
defeat his <149 and took them prisoners, and <1961 to the camp of
<2869 And thus <625 the <600 and <599 year of the <599 of the
<639 over the <61 of <952

50:36 And thus were the <11 of <48 <783 back. And upon
<185 covenanting to keep the <620 they were <13795 to the land of
<92 and a union took <618 <82 them and the <32 of <570
and they were also <24 to <34 <9630

50:37 And it came to pass that in the same year that the <28 of
<665 had <52 <26 unto <121 that Nephihah, the <733 <2088
judge, <6586 <4535 <2237 the judgment-seat with <4136 uprightness
<2372 God.

50:38 <3506 he had refused Alma to take <330 of <330
<9532 and <4 <392 <156 were esteemed by Alma and his <19116 to
be most sacred; <451 Alma had conferred them upon his son,
Helaman.

50:39 <3333 it came to pass that the son of Nephihah was <2689 to
fill the judgment-seat, in the stead of his father; yea, he was
<16 <88 <15247 and governor over the <405 with an oath and
<10808 ordinance to <14 <15261 and to keep the <117 and the
<4217 of the <22 and to <13758 unto them <153 <23 <4196
to <9685 the Lord <8 God, yea, to <4323 and <4296 the <558
of God all his <13971 and to <1402 the <968 to <7230 <1436 to
<25 <17952

50:40 Now <501 his name was Pahoran. And Pahoran did fill the seat
of his father, and did <1935 his <272 in the end of the <284 and
<285 <3545 over the <207 of <278

Alma <2014 51

51:1 And now it came to pass in the <915 of the <31 and
fifth year of the <44 of the <315 over the <37 of <517 they
<232 established <129 <284 the <10 of Lehi and the <5 of
<320 <603 <96 <1761 and <18 <383 the <39 and
<39 year in <985

51:2 <250 they did not long <137 an entire <38 in the
<578 for <498 <889 to be a <887 <576 the <44 <41
the <206 <192 Pahoran; for <136 <17 were a part of the <15
who <5215 that a few <1409 <15709 of the law <784 be altered.

51:3 But <27 <158 <607 not alter nor <3815 the law to be
altered; <2874 he did not <664 to <313 who had sent in <98
voices with <4 petitions <64 the altering of the law.

51:4 <841 <22 who were <7503 that the law <56 be <3230
were <780 with him, and <74 that he <12 no longer be <95
<96 over the <4292 <349 <97 <9011 a warm dispute <46
the <761 but not unto <11776

51:5 And it came to pass that <53 who were <53 that <98
<41 be dethroned from the <424 were <1526 king-men, for
they were <17 that the law <17 be <70 in a <1544 to
<726 the free <13331 and to <7242 a king over the <1387

51:6 And <49 who were <32 that <49 <31 <8421 <87 <86
over the land took upon them the name of freemen; and thus was the
division <207 <501 for the freemen had <3046 or covenanted to
<233 <154 <12841 and the <387 of <6 <11391 by a free
government.

51:7 And it came to pass that this matter of <20 <247 was
settled by the <7345 of the <2361 And it came to pass that the <11
of the <250 came in <5350 of the freemen, and <90 <10830 the
<491 <535 <1953 much <7172 <77 the <1391 of
<14 and also many of the <28 of <4772 who also put the
king-men to silence, that they <3465 not oppose but were <13586 to
<98 the <468 of <7331

51:8 Now <146 who were in <60 of kings were <8 of high <2677 and
they <5151 to be kings; and they were <22150 by <16 who <11
<1866 and <7425 over the <104

51:9 But <328 this was a critical time for such <4289 to be
<93 the <84 of <1553 for <18 <3555 had <3232 <5145 up
the <1149 of the <15 of the <1923 <1273 the <6 of the
<3040 and he was gathering <5156 <10692 from all <1002 of his
<425 and arming <212 and <2678 for war with all diligence; for he
had <219 to <2705 the <3617 of <828

51:10 But <61 we <1646 see that his <4134 <171 he made was rash;
<5427 he did <2317 <3627 and his <2125 to come to <886
<72 the <2494

51:11 Now his <15 were not so <2654 as they had <3426 <4566
<2044 of the many <1604 who had been <2869 by the hand of the
<2813 but <4352 <263 <26 loss, <127 had <5261
<106 a wonderfully <9 <921 <1405 that he <1137 not to come
down to the land of <2321

51:12 Yea, even <29 did <81 come <6606 at the head of the
<1634 And it was in the <588 and <587 year of the <626 of the
<23764 and it was at the same time that they had <19212 to settle the
<3722 of <77 <213 <474 the <401 <876 <713

51:13 And it came to pass that when the men who were <462 <305
had <5899 that the <217 were <2469 down to <151 <150 <201
they were glad in <42 <27185 and they <898 to take up <14060 for
they were so <7201 with the <55 <55 and also with the <250 of
<356 that they <617 not take up arms to <2739 <36 country.

51:14 And it came to pass that when <1230 saw <11580 and also saw that
the <71 were <71 into the <1200 of the <276 he was
<1480 <57 <209 of the <10961 of <354 <55 whom he
had <22658 with so much <2875 to preserve; yea, he was <23
wroth; his soul was <1009 with <7417 <109 <1499

51:15 And it came to pass that he sent a petition, with the <484 of
the <923 unto the <951 of the <64 <5981 that he <575 read
it, and give him (Moroni) <415 to <7296 <68 <5789 to <113
<114 country or to put them to <15671

51:16 For it was his <1836 care to put an end to such <215 and
<5763 <428 the <5158 for <365 this had been <326 a
<498 of all <42 <27034 And it came to pass that it was <9256
<967 to the <87 of the <478

51:17 And it came to pass that <172 <3700 that his army <92 go
<127 <85 <712 to pull down <43 pride and <3 nobility and
level them with the <3396 or they <23 take up arms and <1035 the
<68 of <1446

51:18 And it came to pass that the <419 did <3827 <2443 <46 <3441
and they did pull down <45 <48 and <3 nobility, <395 that as
they did lift <9 <10996 of war to <12774 <26 the men of <84
they were hewn down and leveled to the <6501

51:19 And it came to pass that <845 were four <3427 of <101
<187 who were hewn down by the sword; and <11 of <49 <4378
who were not <479 in <360 were <6578 and cast into <8663 for <34
was no time for <22 <22794 at this period.

51:20 And the <8135 of <37 <6002 <1625 than be smitten
down to the <3025 by the <2113 yielded to the <7991 of <372 and
were <4906 to hoist the <8029 of <5430 upon <44 <2957 and in
<5 <3076 and to take up arms in defence of <10 <389

51:21 And thus <128 put an end to <59 <208 that <81 were not
any <4356 by the appellation of king-men; and thus he put an end to the
<386 and the <180 of <28 <389 who professed the <662 of
nobility; but they were <1463 down to <5049 <3781 like unto
<61 <1987 and to <190 valiantly for <7 <1296 from <3420

51:22 <1356 it came to pass that <5753 <75 was thus breaking down
the wars and <343 <340 his own <397 and subjecting them to
<1166 and civilization, and <3242 regulations to <701 for war
<237 the <2783 <359 the <485 had come into the land of
<1635 <728 was in the <493 by the <2107

51:23 And it came to pass that the <2691 were not sufficiently
<2502 in the city of <2630 <1102 <670 did drive <592
slaying many. And it came to pass that <13 took <1488 of
the <2642 yea, <6 of all <114 fortifications.

51:24 And <148 who fled out of the city of <114 came to the city of
Nephihah; and also the <166 of the city of Lehi <753 <158
<8495 and made <3354 and were ready to <16706 the <109
to <4446

51:25 But it came to pass that <70 <638 not <1253 the
<20 to go <137 the city of <1525 to battle, but kept them
down by the <3013 <14023 men in <3166 city to <1007 and <550
it.

51:26 And thus he went on, taking <107 of many <298 the city
of <1637 and the city of <2296 and the city of <1695 and the
city of Omner, and the city of Gid, and the city of Mulek, all of <196
were on the east <198 by the <198

51:27 And thus had the <94 obtained, by the <6453 of
<3746 so many <62 by <171 <23426 hosts, all of <35
were strongly fortified <4682 the <1257 of the <3088 of
<215 all of <16 afforded <3068 for the <880

51:28 And it came to pass that they <4489 to the <65 of the land
<2070 driving the <256 <1731 them and <243 <243

51:29 But it came to pass that they were met by <1920 who had <500
<1518 and had <8640 his <224 in his flight.

51:30 And it came to pass that he <17 <207 <5666 as he was
<14260 <606 with his <6255 army that he <3179 take <178 of
the land <70 and also the land <2059

51:31 But <2365 he met with a disappointment by <2238 repulsed by
<1953 and his men, for they were <1032 warriors; for <233 man of
<14 did <4539 the <168 in <158 <3096 and in <4 skill
of war, <657 that they did gain advantage over the <149

51:32 And it came to pass that they did harass <381 <23 that they
did slay them even <2120 it was dark. And it came to pass that <56
and his men did <7871 <53 <7870 in the <178 of the land Bountiful;
and <131 did <14 his <14 in the <14 on the beach by the
<329 and <232 this <232 were they driven.

51:33 And it came to pass that when the <7891 had come, <55 and his
<6835 stole <167 and went out by night, and went into the camp of
<8197 and <521 sleep had overpowered them <995 of <76
much fatigue, <274 was <1421 by the <17887 and heat of the day.

51:34 And it came to pass that <53 <49 <25317 into the tent of
the <4078 and put a javelin to his <7303 and he did <857 the <6840 of
the king <26116 that he did not awake his servants.

51:35 And he <2158 <1377 <41 to his own <2316 and <81 his
men were asleep, and he <7726 them and told them all the <2041 that he
had <19550

51:36 And he <95 that his <902 <925 <9218 in readiness, lest the
<247 had awakened and <11 come upon <1085

51:37 And thus endeth the <1267 and <1267 year of the <1267 of the
<1894 over the <353 of <1458 and thus <20 the days of
<9001

Alma <1939 52

52:1 And now, it came to pass in the <42 and sixth year of the <42
of the <42 over the <42 of <1936 <112 when the <77
<109 on the <1097 <21597 of the <4 <5530 <14 they <2697
<269 was dead in his own tent; and they also saw that <191 was
<640 to give them <940 on that day.

52:2 And now, when the <46 saw this they were affrighted; and
they abandoned <245 <15503 in <438 into the land <2434 and
<5060 with all <13 army into the city of <588 and <1610
<3512 in <12 <732

52:3 And it came to pass that the <27343 of <81 was <2184
king over the <1181 and his name was Ammoron; thus king Ammoron, the
<20 of king <602 was <21 to <134 in his stead.

52:4 And it came to pass that he did <8494 that his <146 <214
<705 <788 <627 <331 they had <1053 by the <5855 of <4308
for they had not <11 any <3440 save they had lost much <6343

52:5 And now, <148 saw that the <133 were <2935 to
<41 <41 <24 <41 they had taken, and <7 <1665 of the land
<11 they had <4399 <571 of; and also <25134 the enormity of
<130 number, <38 <9340 it was not <9341 that he <80
<3981 to <4937 them in <17 forts.

52:6 But he kept his men <3837 <4892 as if <970 <857 for
war; yea, and <16396 he was <1716 to <815 <1599 <840 <549 by
<4876 up <4016 <25 <3862 and <14 <4081 of resort.

52:7 And it came to pass that he kept thus <17 for war <569
<925 had sent a <2920 <6685 of men to <6680 his <8161

52:8 And <17 also sent orders unto him that he <93 <12942 all the
prisoners who fell into his <12915 for as the <149 had <170 many
<2616 that he <22 <22 all the <21 of the <15 as
a ransom for <157 whom the <9 had taken.

52:9 And he also sent <54 unto him that he <32 <6753 the land
<737 and <3923 the <2758 pass <181 led into the land
<322 lest the <36 <21 <2869 that <12715 and <5 have
<1513 to <691 them on <734 side.

52:10 And <103 also sent unto him, <1541 him that he <1009 be
<3431 in maintaining that <14954 of the <1556 and that he <14
seek <33 opportunity to scourge the <52 in that quarter, as
much as was in his <23985 that <5546 he <826 take <579 by stratagem
or some <4584 way <116 <280 <88 had been <140 out of <245 <150
and that he also <48 <112 and <185 the <19 <222 <247
<22 had not <7894 into the <4035 of the <803

52:11 And he also said unto him, I <30 come unto you, but <504 the
<78 are upon us in the <771 of the land by the west sea; and
<19 I go <280 <280 <1215 I <11688 come unto you.

52:12 Now, the king (Ammoron) had <9778 out of the land of
<11647 and had made <1377 unto the <7553 <1867 the <713 of
his <20799 and had <1197 <1949 a <288 <288 of men, and had
<1030 <800 <53 the <1023 on the <71 by the west sea.

52:13 And thus he was endeavoring to <211 the <2093 and to draw
away a part of <148 forces to that part of the <200 <1380 he had
<1669 <169 whom he had left to <4220 the <157 <154 he had
<457 that they <256 also <42 the <62 on the <62 by the
east sea, and <14 take <464 of <47 <4062 as much as it was
in <9 <227 <1733 to the <285 of <7 <5388

52:14 And thus were the <40 in <62 dangerous <3932 in
the ending of the <724 and <724 year of the <590 of the <723 over
the <578 of <2697

52:15 But <192 it came to pass in the <28 and seventh year of the
<29 of the <3603 that <1156 by the <611 of Moroni—who had
<2689 <839 to protect the <4106 and the west <105 of the
<138 and had <2076 his <1756 <5755 the land <402 that he <323
assist <568 with his men in retaking the <146 <146 they had lost—

52:16 And it came to pass that <22 had <7921 <443 to make an
<586 upon the city of <741 and retake it if it were possible.

52:17 And it came to pass that <31 made <592 to make an
<30 upon the city of <30 and <77 <260 with his army <263
the <4813 but he saw that it was <28315 that he <4645
<6079 them <241 they were in <190 fortifications; <337 he
<824 his <7589 and <1006 <427 to the city <113 to wait
for the <2092 of <1603 that he <121 <1508 <1222 to his <604

52:18 And it came to pass that <506 did arrive with his army at the
land of <38 in the <6707 end of the <200 and <200 year of
the <200 of the <229 over the <228 of <228

52:19 And in the <2914 of the <26 and eighth <2944 <48 and
<132 and many of the <2212 <5231 held a council of war—what they
<316 do to <1127 the <467 to come out <136 them to <5801 or
that they <98 by some <5874 flatter them out of <131 strongholds,
that they <13 gain <1320 over them and take <133 the city of
Mulek.

52:20 And it came to pass they sent embassies to the army of the
<1759 <253 protected the city of <201 to <44 leader, <3385
name was <10588 <642 him that he <550 come out with his <311 to
meet them upon the plains <3007 the two <4945 But <352 <24
who was a Zoramite, <25 not come out with his army to meet them upon
the plains.

52:21 And it came to pass that <213 <3029 no hopes of meeting them
upon fair grounds, <2955 he resolved upon a plan that he <118
decoy the <147 out of <86 strongholds.

52:22 <3581 he <1231 that <179 <166 take a <7601 <568 of
men and <307 down near the seashore; and <198 and his <2530 by
<1373 <580 in the <4688 on the west of the city Mulek; and
<17331 on the morrow, when the <9105 of the <58 had <9499
<449 they ran and told it unto <122 <67 <8902

52:23 And it came to pass that the <150 of the <28 did <65
<373 <234 <30 <6203 by <25 numbers to <362 <86
<1424 of the smallness of his numbers. And as <11 saw the <30
of the <31 <356 out <29 him he <3145 to <6265 down by the
<1502 <1622

52:24 And it came to pass that when the <27 saw that he <25 to
<7348 they took courage and <8430 them with vigor. And <423 <52
was thus leading away the <25 who were <8580 them in <8440
<231 <149 <678 that a part of his army who were with him
<177 <104 <103 into the <1984 and take <665 of it.

52:25 And thus they did, and slew all <649 who had been left to
<596 the <26 yea, all <12 who <274 not yield up <136 <2326
of war.

52:26 And thus <64 had <1175 <46 of the city Mulek with a
part of his <224 <96 he <223 with the <2275 to meet the
<98 when they <79 <10024 from the pursuit of Teancum.

52:27 And it came to pass that the <21 did <8753 <129 <1137
they came near the city <505 and then they were met by Lehi and a
<293 <55 <402 had been left to <97 the city Bountiful.

52:28 And now <150 when the <491 <491 of the <46 had
<25962 Lehi with his army <224 <223 <938 they fled in much
confusion, lest <1031 they <84 not <1098 the city <110 <1922
Lehi <9 overtake <2479 for they were wearied <269 of <141
march, and the men of Lehi were fresh.

52:29 Now the <54 did not know that <151 had been in <25 rear
with his army; and all they <2900 was Lehi and his men.

52:30 Now Lehi was not <3254 to <58 them till they <63 meet
<36 and his <660

52:31 And it came to pass that <83 the <57 had <1513 far
they were <9408 by the <975 by the men of <31 on one <5715
and the men of Lehi on the other, all of whom were fresh and full of
<10812 but the <40 were <118 <118 of <93 long march.

52:32 And <38 <320 his men that they <78 fall upon them
<217 they had <9532 up <24 <283 of war.

52:33 And it came to pass that <459 <2007 <16 <613 <3 also a
<584 and <560 an unconquerable <12659 he led the <60
<354 to <1647 with <25495 fury <210 <3133

52:34 <61 <28 in <32 <5353 of <191 <822 Jacob was
<1521 to slay them and cut his way <6019 to the city of <693
But <259 <28 and his men were more powerful; <28 they did
not give way <158 the <1237

52:35 And it came to pass that they <6518 on both <1255 with <69
fury; and <2573 were many <2167 on both sides; yea, and <46 was
<6163 and <71 was killed.

52:36 And Lehi pressed upon <87 rear with such fury with his <2470
men, that the <116 in the rear <4797 up <18 <153 of war;
and the <412 of <332 <117 much confused, knew not <7855 to go
or to strike.

52:37 Now <61 <1621 <29 <347 he said unto <11458 If ye will
<3864 <160 your <41 of war and <7867 them up, <2201 we will
forbear <1701 your <1687

52:38 And it came to pass that when the <75 had <3144 <4938
<7693 <46 <413 captains, all <521 who were not slain, came <45
and <14113 down <15 <49 of war at the feet of <788 and also
<270 <13 men that they <270 do the same.

52:39 But <197 <160 were many that <561 not; and <45 who <5
not <83 up <28 <6520 were <1463 and bound, and <7 <48 of
war were <10 from <137 and they were <2805 to <627 with <16
<3554 <72 into the land <508

52:40 And now the <818 of <1630 who were <30 exceeded more than
the <11 of <58 who had been <103 yea, more than <8 who had
been <235 on both sides.

Alma <2035 53

53:1 And it came to pass that they did set <830 over the <50 of
the <983 and did <3141 them to go <75 and bury <81 <9697
yea, and also the dead of the <1350 who were <6397 and <223
<5621 men over them to guard them <669 they <154 <28269 <28
<28269

53:2 And <21 went to the city of <585 with <2612 and took <1333
of the city and gave it unto <7252 Now <177 this Lehi was a man who
had been with <33 in the more part of all his battles; and he was a
man like unto <223 and they rejoiced in each other’s safety; yea,
they were <27867 by each <531 and also <6 by all the <1196 of
<1197

53:3 And it came to pass that <2394 the <290 had finished burying
<101 dead and also the dead of the <584 they were <783 back
into the land <2437 and <958 by the <1379 of <67 <1045
that they <132 <4187 laboring in <6123 a <6857 <1713 <1935 the
<1437 or the <852 <247

53:4 And he <26 that they <25 <5498 a breastwork of <6066 upon
the inner bank of the ditch; and they cast up dirt out of the <41
<556 the <23 of timbers; and thus they did <1267 the
<95 to <8486 <615 they had <15509 the city of Bountiful <65
<66 with a <481 wall of <50 and <3286 to an <525 height.

53:5 And this city <5481 an <11 stronghold ever after; and in
this city they did <243 the <281 of the <1448 yea, even
<26383 a wall <867 they had <100 them to <99 with <156 own <15390
Now <221 was <377 to <78 the <77 to labor, <713 it
was easy to <40 them <283 at <24 labor; and he <4138 all his
<1729 when he <137 make an <1516 upon the <625

53:6 And it came to pass that <47 had thus <9597 a <12837 over one
of the <26707 of the <1140 of the <364 and had <1015
<1016 of the city of <1351 <88 was one of the <6998 holds
of the <79 in the land of <2460 and thus he had also <6228 a
<134 to <2088 his prisoners.

53:7 And it came to pass that he did no more <2219 a <763 with the
<39 in that <1489 but he did employ his men in <2175 for war,
yea, and in <2223 <2932 to <130 <229 the <84 yea,
and also <6578 <135 women and <3 <5633 from famine and
affliction, and providing food for <11 <1808

53:8 And now it came to pass that the <121 of the <37 on the
west sea, <6081 <175 in the absence of <150 on <18221 of some
intrigue <8295 the <359 <132 <218 <3614 <6 <590
had <164 some <14873 over the <13 yea, <2835 that they had
<159 <158 of a <575 of <64 <1769 in that part of the
<4275

53:9 And thus <238 of <7984 <40 <5604 yea, <6 of
<47 and <55 <3323 <3202 they were <536 in the most
<1895 circumstances.

53:10 And now <508 I have <14166 to say <2037 the <466 of
<8524 who in the beginning, were <313 but by <6643 and his
<3395 or <3503 by the <1947 and word of God, they had been
converted unto the <13917 and they had been <3426 down into the land
of <2092 and had ever <5606 been <1616 by the <4075

53:11 And <91 of <114 oath they had been kept from <3225 up arms
<211 <12 <13450 for they had <714 an oath that they <5652
<769 shed <3483 <13761 and <2020 to <19 oath they <10 have
perished; yea, they <6 have <14648 <129 to have <2224 into
the <970 of <21 <99 had it not been for the pity and the
<446 love <205 <117 and his <785 had had for <2814

53:12 And for this <424 they were <109 down into the land of
Zarahemla; and they ever had been <109 by the <109

53:13 But it came to pass that when they saw the danger, and the many
<30877 and tribulations <58 the <752 bore for <264 they
were <9328 with compassion and were <1256 to take up arms in the
<3651 of <96 <3651

53:14 But <225 as they were <563 to take <14 <895 of war, they
were <3032 by the persuasions of <8722 and his <124 for
they were <23 to <18151 the oath <63 they had <29935

53:15 And <22 <1329 lest by so <8868 they <519 lose <43 souls;
<1152 all <891 who had <10086 into this <11784 were <562
to <1043 <17 <153 wade <1185 <4 <23687 in <3
<309 <2204 at this <9792

53:16 But <86 it came to pass they had many <8812 who had not
<41 into a <41 that they <220 not take <34 <101 of war
to <2684 <227 <260 <9 <7324 <66 they did assemble
<9 <2371 at this <5886 as many as were able to take up <4212
and they <4244 <18 <197

53:17 And they <51 into a <51 to <3748 for the <3833 of the
<444 yea, to <1541 the land unto the laying down of <56 lives;
yea, even they <4674 that they <315 <78 give up <13 <3872
but they <8 <37 in all cases to <32 the <228 and
<60 from <3791

53:18 Now <124 <1120 were two <3968 of <161 young men, who
<71 into this <71 and took <41 <119 of war to <118
<7 <241

53:19 And now <32 as they <63 had <4144 been a disadvantage to
the <92 they <795 now at this period of time also a <3425
<24778 for they took <37 <44 of war, and they <86 that
<239 <233 be <12 <1906

53:20 And they were all <76 men, and they were <4288 valiant
for <16906 and also for <2230 and activity; but <68 this was
not <8834 were men who were true at all <22081 in <25792 <10893
they were <23268

53:21 Yea, they were men of <19003 and <19002 for they had been
<9315 to keep the <6183 of God and to walk <13909 <1451
him.

53:22 And now it came to pass that <93 did <1249 at the head of his
two <169 stripling soldiers, to the <4217 of the <608 in the
<2458 of the land on the <2468 by the west sea.

53:23 And thus <5509 the <2280 and <2280 year of the <2305 of the
<2306 over the <36 of <1109

Alma <1257 54

54:1 And now it came to pass in the <2317 of the <37 and
ninth year of the <2540 that Ammoron sent unto <767 <2233 that
he <191 exchange <868

54:2 And it came to pass that <18 felt to <8902 <187 at
this request, for he <970 the provisions <463 were <27073 for the
<113 of the Lamanite <1029 for the <7 of his own <3234
and he also <25 his own <93 for the <9809 of his <1787

54:3 Now the <910 had <673 many <883 and <9716 and <330 was
not a woman nor a child <792 all the <48 of <1193 or the
<6 whom <80 had taken; <445 <4 <2269 upon a
<2936 to <1909 as many <16 of the <379 from the
<49 as it were <2588

54:4 <2275 he <13651 an epistle, and sent it by the <3639 of
<3318 the same who had <679 an epistle to <1752 Now <1569 are
the <5936 <125 he <29 unto <20 <6578

54:5 <4212 <7 I have <13327 unto you <859 <857 this
war <22 ye have waged <530 my <4210 or <849 <9 thy <3364
hath <11 <11 <684 and <9 ye are <25991 <1787 to <17461 on
<1338 his <4597

54:6 <46 I <210 tell you <44 <44 the <5531 of God,
and the <6266 of his almighty wrath, <35 doth hang over you <9647 ye
<19963 and withdraw your <1026 into your own <5457 or the land of
your <6946 <24 is the land of <295

54:7 Yea, I <53 tell you <119 <3660 if ye were capable of
hearkening unto <2072 yea, I <16 tell you <68 that <21692 hell
that awaits to <2683 such murderers as thou and thy <112 have
<4990 <69 ye <68 and <68 your <19161 <19699 and <2200
with your <75 to your own <5814

54:8 But as ye have once rejected <63 <24709 and have <1879 <145
the <285 of the <6794 even so I may expect you will do it <20916

54:9 And now <515 we are <7435 to <72 you; yea, and <65
you <64 your <63 <15 ye will pull down the <22342 of that
God whom you have <58 upon you, even to your utter <4751

54:10 But, as the Lord <16197 our <90 <5137 come upon you <43 ye
withdraw, and ye <10 soon be visited with <13243 for we will <1292
our <1163 and our <10136 yea, and we will <3544 our <5389 and
the <982 of our God.

54:11 But <78 it supposeth me that I talk to you <177 <131
<195 in <10987 or it <15 me that thou art a <392 of <28062
<381 I will close my <339 by telling you that I will not
<490 <3452 save it be on <16247 that ye will <1866 up a
man and his wife and his <440 for one prisoner; if this be the
case that ye will do it, I will exchange.

54:12 And <84 if you do not <5039 I will come <209 you with my
<19072 yea, even I will arm my <486 and my <47 and I will come
<21 you, and I will <20722 you even into your own <1665 <325 is
the land of our <3867 <29139 yea, and it <173 be <1187 for
<16705 yea, life for life; and I will give you <1452 even <1642 you
are <9319 from off the face of the <4852

54:13 <413 I am in my <10557 and also my <586 ye have <3849 to
murder us, and we have only <9 to <880 ourselves. But <113 if
ye seek to <6601 us more we will seek to <7 you; yea, and we
will seek our <94 the land of our <91 <19224

54:14 Now I <202 my epistle. I am <4442 I am a <11637 of the <357
of the <1023

54:15 Now it came to pass that <546 when he had <3201 this
<589 was angry; and he <567 another <241 unto <638 and <267
are the <580 <156 he wrote, <578

54:16 I am <33 the king of the <1423 I am the <454 of
<3951 whom ye have murdered. <138 I will avenge his <174 upon
you, yea, and I will come upon you with my <373 for I fear not your
threatenings.

54:17 For <143 your <6218 did <23737 <980 <1242 <1545 that
they did rob them of <10 right to the <5821 when it rightly
<14207 unto <1365

54:18 And now <33 if ye will lay down your <1161 and <9334
<17698 to be governed by <1091 to whom the <34 doth <33
belong, then will I <410 that my <160 <267 lay down <53 <1055
and <7 be at war no <20086

54:19 <113 ye have <29490 out many <29490 <315 me and my
<254 but <63 we fear not your <107

54:20 <6094 I will <6246 to <410 <795 <1497 to
your <886 <14257 that I may <10323 my food for my men of war;
and we will wage a war <195 <66 be eternal, either to the <4962
the <827 to our <5762 or to <85 <9910 extinction.

54:21 And as <493 that God whom ye say we have rejected, <75
we know not such a being; <9606 do ye; but if it so be that <905 is
such a thing, we know not but that he hath made us as well as you.

54:22 And if it so be that <29 is a <10241 and a hell, <1416 will he
not send you <14 to <24281 with my <275 whom ye have murdered, whom
ye have hinted that he hath gone to such a place? But <31 <319
<586 <5984 not.

54:23 I am <315 and a descendant of Zoram, whom your <273
<2581 and <928 out of Jerusalem.

54:24 And <33 now, I am a bold Lamanite; <124 this war hath been
<903 to <331 <151 wrongs, and to <663 and to <997 <8
<6062 to the government; and I <428 my <389 to <969

Alma <1153 55

55:1 Now it came to pass that when <1035 had <421 this <24 he
was more <16582 <1767 he knew that <1154 had a <6606 <11302 of
his fraud; yea, he knew that <13 knew that it was not a just <316
that had <1932 him to wage a war <298 the <325 of <925

55:2 And he <11823 <317 I will not <292 <292 with <37
save he will <832 his <27373 as I have stated in my epistle; for
I will not <317 unto him that he <293 have any more <1889 than what
he hath got.

55:3 <47 I know the <6752 <11559 the <1129 do <2069 my <68
whom they have <1185 prisoners; and as <60 <978 not <43 unto me
mine <548 <180 I will give unto him <368 to my <29394 yea,
I will seek <4002 <1199 them <678 they <64 sue for <16789

55:4 And now it came to pass that when <169 had said <258 <2725 he
<137 that a <32980 <1499 be made <34 his men, that <3128 he
<3487 find a man who was a <269 of <19835 <17 <517

55:5 And it came to pass that they <4625 one, <3589 name was Laman; and
he was one of the <11934 of the king who was <21029 by <4697

55:6 Now <71 <65 that <44 and a <3229 <2118 of his men <71
go <2648 unto the <2665 who were over the <696

55:7 Now the <464 were guarded in the city of Gid; <932 <38
<4586 <38 and <42 that a <40 <40 of men <39 go with
him.

55:8 And when it was evening <23 went to the <51 who were over the
<1660 and <183 they saw him <3271 and they hailed him; but he
<15758 unto <2922 Fear not; <17 I am a Lamanite. <234 we have
escaped from the <31 and they <26372 and <404 we have <233 of
<386 wine and <422 with us.

55:9 Now when the <258 <2925 <199 <773 they <372 him with
joy; and they said unto him: Give us of your wine, that we may drink;
we are glad that ye have thus <48 wine with you for we are weary.

55:10 But <110 said unto <87 Let us keep of our wine till we go
<383 the <161 to <5460 But this <15897 only made them more
<2058 to <6319 of the wine;

55:11 For, said they: We are weary, <180 let us take of the <75
and by and by we <317 <1241 wine for our rations, <681 will
<4421 us to go <55 the <223

55:12 And <77 said unto <77 You may do <359 to your <9726

55:13 And it came to pass that they did take of the wine <20990 and it
was pleasant to <169 taste, <70 they took of it more <15 and
it was <9832 <3294 been <1313 in its <25429

55:14 And it came to pass they did <113 and were merry, and by and by
they were all drunken.

55:15 And now when <85 and his men saw that they were all drunken,
and were in a deep sleep, they <4136 to <318 and told him all the
<687 that had happened.

55:16 And now this was <117 to the <4986 of <638 And <26
had <84 his men with <902 of war; and he went to the city Gid,
<2549 the <273 were in a deep <5267 and <64 and cast in
<25 of war unto the <1299 <995 that they were all armed;

55:17 Yea, even to <148 women, and all <970 of <6 <1254 as
many as were able to use a weapon of war, when <72 had <14230 all
<22 <579 and all <4 <101 were done in a profound silence.

55:18 But had they <5218 the <2636 <371 they were drunken and
the <298 <4288 have <3162 <531

55:19 But <405 this was not the <9364 of <1190 he did not <10880
in <1248 or <16631 but he delighted in the saving of his <648
from <24902 and for this <735 he <582 not <3361 upon him
injustice, he <655 not fall upon the <143 and <1259 them in
<112 drunkenness.

55:20 But he had <2675 his <30712 for he had <110 <104 <746
of the <84 who were <2932 the wall of the <3039 and had <3604
them <733 to gain <2703 of <24 <5064 <357 were <20 the
walls.

55:21 And then he <563 the men who were with him to <785 a pace
from <1801 and <13186 the <1218 of the <2931

55:22 Now <151 this was done in the <13205 so that when the
<99 <5308 in the <5307 they <3846 that they were <3735 by
the <86 without, and that <111 <95 were <99 within.

55:23 And thus they saw that the <19 had <93 over <1777 and in
<554 <2449 they <715 that it was not <5140 that they
<647 <2346 with the <6746 <415 <41 <3494 <3907 demanded
<5 <295 of war, and they <595 them <702 and cast them at the
feet of the <621 pleading for mercy.

55:24 Now <237 this was the <236 of <361 He took them <82
of war, and took <162 of the <174 and <150 that all the
<16 <65 be liberated, who were <66 and they did join the
army of <1423 and were a <2355 <2315 to his <2098

55:25 And it came to pass that he did <267 the <319 whom he had
<643 <386 that they <46 <3281 a <3221 in <2130 the
<3014 <3218 <2631 the city Gid.

55:26 And it came to pass that when he had <5971 the city Gid,
<465 to his <14560 he <89 that his <87 <41 be <47
to the city <3341 and he also <829 that city with an
<2221 <3263 force.

55:27 And it came to pass that they did, <6924 all the
intrigues of the <89 keep and <2534 all the <46 whom
they had <4917 and also <1176 all the <3030 and the <4561
<317 they had retaken.

55:28 And it came to pass that the <248 <4311 <4575 to be
victorious, and to <22285 <227 <1204 and <3 privileges.

55:29 Many time did the <304 <3172 to <12042 them <135 by
<4454 but in <274 <10063 they did lose many <2335

55:30 And many <2489 did they <26 to <13321 of <41 wine to
the <258 that they <455 <441 them with <13334 or with
<443

55:31 But <266 the <78 were not slow to <15210 the Lord <32
God in this <5 time of affliction. They <532 not be <173 in <10
snares; yea, they <491 not <21752 of <9 <813 save they had <1738
<459 to some of the <2383 <83

55:32 And they were thus cautious that no <69 <212 be administered
<1105 <385 for if <34 wine <40 <12 a <27 it <5 also
<7 a Nephite; and thus they did try all <19 liquors.

55:33 And now it came to pass that it was <410 for <651 to make
<4938 to <3419 the city <8103 for <115 the <170
had, by <34 labors, <289 the city <6198 <1217 it had <10667
an <3065 stronghold.

55:34 And they were <32291 <21267 new <3460 into that <395 and
also new supplies of provisions.

55:35 And thus <2591 the <2554 and <2553 year of the <2591 of the
<2591 over the <655 of <1371

Alma <1438 56

56:1 And now it came to pass in the <2591 of the thirtieth year
of the <36 of the <2592 on the <8052 day in the <177 <5873
<115 <1087 an <1459 from <9919 stating the <7195 of the
<54 in that <5475 of the <3339

56:2 And <285 are the <1115 <338 he <1888 <1888 My dearly <3781
<5346 <481 as well in the Lord as in the <3138 of our
warfare; <155 my <19 <18 I have <2436 to tell you
<1702 our warfare in this part of the <52

56:3 <1197 two <2754 of the sons of <711 men whom <3233 <592
down out of the land of Nephi—now ye have <5417 that <75 were
<21160 of Laman, who was the eldest son of our <29913 <8210

56:4 Now I need not rehearse unto you <63 <224 <12835 or
<4 <8989 for thou <26861 <10 all <38 <33951

56:5 <2612 it <25181 me that I tell you that two <76 of
<19 <2924 men have <356 <31 <673 of war, and <310 that I
<329 be <11 leader; and we have come <682 to <2128 our <3007

56:6 And now ye also know <57 the <3030 <167 <24 <1724
<15789 that they <36 not take up <10 <45 of war <1187 <5
<3205 to shed <4246

56:7 But in the <279 and <5404 <3661 when they saw our <3326
and our <190 for <839 they were <508 to <3274 the <51
<52 they had made and take up <43 <48 of war in our defence.

56:8 But I <65 not <6743 them that they <103 <31 this <31
<31 they had <82 <4942 that God <18 <1267 us, <1088
that we <19 not <25 more <1746 of the <9342 the oath <24
they had <5837

56:9 But <261 here is one <3050 in <16 we may have <762 joy. For
<14 in the <105 and <105 <105 I, <329 did <3021 at the head
of <186 two <191 <188 men to the city of Judea, to <5458
Antipus, whom ye had <1539 a <2262 over the <352 of that part of
the <301

56:10 And I did join my two <38 <3349 (for they are worthy to be
<3310 sons) to the army of <42 in <81 <839 Antipus did
<2980 <11014 for <81 his army had been reduced by the
<518 <121 <164 <493 had <1150 a vast <1597 of our men, for
<31 <854 we have to mourn.

56:11 <2136 we may console <15695 in this <15566 that they
have died in the <24 of <39 <7450 and of <4 God, yea, and they
are happy.

56:12 And the <59 had also <7972 many <895 all of whom
are <1002 <4496 for none <5912 have they spared alive. And we
<17379 that they are now at this time in the land of <3981 it is so
if they are not <10736

56:13 And now <184 are the <2694 of <101 the <58 have <1195
<1006 by the <4572 of the <2371 of so many of our <3310 men:

56:14 The land of <21066 or the city of <5 and the city of Zeezrom,
and the city of Cumeni, and the city of Antiparah.

56:15 And <59 are the <59 <58 they <9213 when I arrived at
the city of Judea; and I <1135 <203 and his men toiling with <149
<845 to <6018 the <10251

56:16 Yea, and they were depressed in body as well as in <4844 for
they had <2896 <7290 by day and toiled by <6749 to <964 <37
<13087 and thus they had <3827 <333 <424 of <6108 kind.

56:17 And now they were <3064 to conquer in this <2025 or die;
<1195 you may well <183 that this <17479 force <97 I <602
with me, yea, <611 sons of mine, gave them <44 <5473 and much joy.

56:18 And now it came to pass that when the <184 saw that <116
had <722 a <13003 <326 to his <5171 they were <3729 by the
<4436 of <2074 to not come <532 the city of <395 or <6 us,
to <1780

56:19 And thus were we <12460 of the <4008 for had they come upon us
in this our weakness they <165 have <2052 <2763 our <98 <5134
but thus were we <29162

56:20 They were <4780 by <60 to <154 <108 <214 <117
they had <501 And thus <867 the <483 and <483 <9586 And in the
<841 of the <11 and <5775 year we had <1664 our city
and <390 for <576

56:21 Now we were <1863 that the <130 <556 come upon us; for
we were not <13 to make an <970 upon them in <218 <5615

56:22 And it came to pass that we kept <21089 out <1284 <6280 to <21486
the movements of the <1222 that they <116 not pass us by <254
nor by day to make an <45 upon our <419 <108 <108 were on the
<5538

56:23 For we knew in <124 <16 they were not <7499 <1284 to
meet <1089 <259 we were desirous, if they <94 pass by us, to
fall upon them in <87 <20948 and thus <1642 them up in the rear at the
same time they were met in the front. We <11702 that we <1176
<5634 <45 but <575 we were <11884 in this our desire.

56:24 They <8457 not pass by us with <49 <14749 <274 <2627 <10
they with a <16759 lest they <71 not be <86 <86 and they
<8 fall.

56:25 Neither <23 they <694 down <284 the city of <4159
<34 <11 they <21104 the head of <18801 over to the city of
<10231

56:26 And <5762 with <59 forces, they were <396 to <266
<143 <143 <159 they had <266

56:27 And now it came to pass in the <1093 <12504 of this <758 <2662
was <406 unto us many <3664 from the <904 of <35 my two
<725 sons.

56:28 And also <24 were sent two <12 men unto us from the land
of <8365 And thus we were <304 with ten <17 men, and
<42 for <904 and also for <86 <12680 and <3 children.

56:29 And the <267 thus <5217 our <742 <10488 <32864 and
<26 <6135 for our <20065 they <1466 to be fearful, and <5
to sally <12897 if it were possible to put an end to our receiving
<28 and <2112

56:30 Now when we saw that the <360 <31 to grow uneasy on this
wise, we were <361 to <264 a <3712 into <23730 upon <246
<292 <509 ordered that I <212 <204 <1057 with my <456 sons
to a neighboring <1315 as if we were carrying <56 to a
<11 <639

56:31 And we were to <30 near the city of Antiparah, as if we were
going to the city beyond, in the <3947 by the <7671

56:32 And it came to pass that we did <34 <118 as if with our
provisions, to go to that <55

56:33 And it came to pass that <92 did <25 <89 with a part of
his <328 <7785 the <5413 to <270 the <28 But he did not
<21 <21 <1438 I had gone <5 with my <115 <23 and came near
the city <782

56:34 And now, in the city Antiparah were <12749 the <4856 army
of the <3225 yea, the most numerous.

56:35 And it came to pass that when they had been <21936 by <252
spies, they came <56 with <7 army and <5122 <380 us.

56:36 And it came to pass that we did flee <4128 <286 <513 And
thus we did lead away the most <29943 army of the <63

56:37 Yea, even to a considerable distance, <1166 that when they saw
the army of <142 <6045 <37 with <59 <27031 they did not turn
to the <3262 nor to the left, but <6079 <16 <140 in a <11031
<5679 <3881 us; and, as we <24931 it was <15 <34190 to slay us
<77 <42 <273 <5838 <43 and this that they <620 not be
<2083 by our <8453

56:38 And now <1130 beholding our <4629 did speed the <50 of his
<1974 But <558 it was night; <316 they did not <41 us,
<513 did <48 <6 <329 <12 we did camp for the night.

56:39 And it came to pass that <69 the dawn of the <34071 <39
the <375 were <120 us. Now we were not <574 <574 to
<12004 with <41 yea, I <1314 not <1307 that my <251 sons <100
fall into <112 <7022 <56 we did <28006 our <5805 and we took
our <89 into the <11762

56:40 Now they <594 not turn to the <162 nor to the left lest they
<40 be surrounded; <98 <51 I turn to the <17 nor to the left
lest they <17 <110 me, and we <691 not <7638 <259 <164 but
be <5576 and they <29 make <71 escape; and thus we did flee all
that day into the <6408 even <350 it was <7863

56:41 And it came to pass that <14864 when the <18997 of the <2288
came we saw the <140 upon us, and we did flee <156 <2458

56:42 But it came to pass that they did not <6207 us far <18 they
halted; and it was in the <40 of the <10532 day of the <938
month.

56:43 And now, <25280 they were overtaken by <224 we knew not, but
I said unto my men: <1713 we know not but they have halted for the
<30223 that we <139 come <133 <133 that they <295 catch us in
<132 snare;

56:44 <1676 what say ye, my <1441 will ye go <24 them to
battle?

56:45 And now I say unto you, my <1791 <3411 <1809 that <4663 had
I seen so <1155 <4613 nay, not <5169 all the <2836

56:46 For as I had ever <1480 them my sons (for they were all of them
very young) even so they said unto me: Father, <2479 our God is with
us, and he will not <301 that we <103 <25423 then let us go <26200
we <235 not slay our <1705 if they <7 let us alone; <313
let us go, lest they <27 <954 the army of Antipus.

56:47 Now they <96 had fought, yet they did not fear <16745 and they
did <28607 more upon the <4863 of <150 <863 than they did upon
<7 <4857 yea, they had been <4688 by <8 mothers, that if they
did not doubt, God <67 <4080 <260

56:48 And they rehearsed unto me the <1974 of <25 <25 <1974 We
do not doubt our mothers knew it.

56:49 And it came to pass that I did <4309 with my two <895
<205 <1449 <313 who had <556 us. And now <463 the <2641
of <270 had <274 <245 and a terrible <4043 had commenced.

56:50 The army of <17 <6141 <3070 <1650 of <66 long <448 in
so <34909 a <13700 of <5011 were <1840 to fall into the <5251 of the
<647 and had I not <2961 with my two <68 they <113 have
<1569 <36 purpose.

56:51 For <48 had <5283 by the <8868 and many of his <21758
<57 of <21 weariness, <1058 was occasioned by the <601 of <9
march—therefore the men of <614 <77 confused <20 of the fall
of <15 <29 <944 to give way <409 the <2752

56:52 And it came to pass that the <135 took <317 and <22 to
<433 <582 and thus were the <13 <600 them with <333 vigor
when <4878 came upon <44 rear with his two thousand, and <27 to
slay them <11289 <753 that the <1208 army of the <31
<421 and <21538 upon <10223

56:53 Now when the <1864 of <118 saw that the <20 had <18
them <1357 they <7548 <5177 <49 men and came <2540 upon the
rear of the <96

56:54 And now it came to pass that we, the <40 of <8159 the <4
of <134 and I with my two <82 did <2882 the <1128 and
did slay <112 yea, <85 that they were <1564 to <309 up
<58 <2047 of war and also <5165 as <2635 of war.

56:55 And now it came to pass that when they had surrendered <20
up unto us, <290 I <19521 <1232 <1991 men who had <1703 with me,
<17471 lest <1231 were many of them <1832

56:56 But <25 to my <173 joy, <16 had not one soul of them
<256 to the <30454 yea, and they had <38 as if with the <1657
of God; yea, <444 were men <2294 to have <16 with such miraculous
<6670 and with such <14597 <2945 did they fall upon the <125
that they did frighten <126 and for this <1965 did the <189
<127 <99 up as <120 of war.

56:57 And as we had no <1768 for our <1964 that we <779 <3795
them to keep them from the <412 of the <49 <535 we sent
them to the land of <5701 and a part of <139 men who were not
<2059 of <207 with <68 and the <1153 I took and <11198 them
to my <5172 Ammonites, and took our <430 back to the city of
Judea.

Alma <2548 57

57:1 And now it came to pass that I <1804 an <2526 from <4066
the <8574 <2529 that if I <438 <115 up <68 <114 of war
whom we had <2390 that he <14 <14 up the city of <1188 unto
us.

57:2 But I sent an <42 unto the <40 that we were sure our <1419
were sufficient to take the city of <30 by our force; and by
<6004 up the <56 for that city we <672 <1924 <1772
unwise, and that we <59 only <60 up our <18 on <4683

57:3 And <1827 <9765 mine <3956 for he <19 not <4032
<3395 <176 we <437 to make <2752 to go <611 the
city of <1288

57:4 But the <384 of <69 did leave the <1418 and fled to <365
<1759 <8409 <542 they had <2136 of, to <2062 <193 and thus
the city of <26 fell into our <6252

57:5 And thus <1885 the <1874 and <5343 year of the <2716 of the
<11513

57:6 And it came to pass that in the <1900 of the <26 and
<2779 <1637 we <202 a supply of <1428 and also an addition to
our <1387 from the land of <277 and from the land <1870 <513 to
the <2332 of six <660 men, besides sixty of the sons of the
Ammonites who had come to join <109 <4572 my <1174 band of two
thousand. And now <429 we were <3711 yea, and we had also plenty
of <1548 <1705 unto us.

57:7 And it came to pass that it was our <3296 to wage a <765 with
the army <154 was <6124 to <3157 the city Cumeni.

57:8 And now <52 I will show unto you that we soon <15393 our
desire; yea, with our <1263 force, or with a part of our <8 <8
we did surround, by <3133 the city <2298 a <96 <719 they were
to <3869 a <151 of <2948

57:9 And it came to pass that we did camp <147 <818 the city for many
nights; but we did <3722 upon our <21421 and keep <16396 that the
<496 <473 not come upon us by <2028 and slay us, <106 they
attempted many times; but as many <3187 as they <9 this <169
<2403 was spilt.

57:10 At length <11 <158 did arrive, and they were <63 to
<13473 the city by <1407 And we, <13278 of <832 <516 were
<3431 <7744 we did take them and <30 <102

57:11 And <3331 the <75 <21 cut off from <14
<5553 <1512 this <27403 they were <5404 <1944 to <1674 the
<13608 <378 it <5820 <3134 that we <416 take <480
<68 and send them to <2283 and our <415 to the land of
<1910

57:12 And it came to pass that not many days had <23129 away <180 the
<64 <421 to lose all <2363 of succor; <52 they <9818 up
the city unto our <1464 and thus we had <233 our <8086 in
<15469 the city <257

57:13 But it came to pass that our <68 were so <9363 <15775
<114 the <8785 of our <14274 we were <10571 to <6546
all our <2435 to keep <1073 or to put them to <5518

57:14 For <297 they <506 <2864 out in <781 <31 and <7
<3668 with stones, and with clubs, or <5888 <2838 they <236 get
into <161 <16921 <870 that we did slay upwards of two <411 of
them <172 they had <851 <752 <79 of war.

57:15 <1367 it <172 <172 for us, that we <174 put an end
to <40 <14738 or <755 <81 <5575 in <7497 down to the land of
<2178 and also our <194 were not any more than <641
for our own <5641 <124 that <302 we had <685 from the
<985

57:16 And now, in <225 <10649 circumstances, it <63 a very
<11604 <4799 to determine <3067 <1226 <82 of war;
<10578 we did resolve to send them down to the land of
<64 <213 we selected a part of our men, and gave them
charge over our <33 to go down to the land of <264

57:17 But it came to pass that on the <16405 they did return. And now
<187 we did not <23904 of them <70 the <696 for
<12 the <278 were upon us, and they <1247 in season to save
us from falling into <152 <665 For <21 <731 had sent to <8
<361 a new <483 of <149 and also a <268 army of men.

57:18 And it came to pass that <138 men whom we sent with the
<99 did <2228 in <53 to check <196 as they were <442 to
<1474 us.

57:19 But <59 my <542 band of two <250 and <660 <1029 most
desperately; yea, they were firm <376 the <458 and did
<3680 <4750 unto all <56 who opposed <1454

57:20 And as the <965 of our army were <53 to give way <30
the <31 <51 <25 two <48 and <48 were firm and
undaunted.

57:21 Yea, and they did obey and observe to <7312 <2831 word of
<7297 with exactness; yea, and even <3879 to <141 <15403 it was
done unto <831 and I did <3724 the <1513 <283 they said unto me
that <21 <1511 had <1549 <82

57:22 And now <68 it was <276 my <1714 and <74 men who had been
<265 to convey the <1106 to whom we owe this <415 victory;
for it was they who did beat the <1477 <289 they were <13092
back to the city of <23716

57:23 And we <3107 our city <716 and were not all <2813 by
the <10400 <333 we had <2947 <46 <13709

57:24 And it came to pass that <440 the <280 had <12050 I
<9643 gave <2887 that my men who had been <7747 <437 be
<399 from <3791 the <7488 and <4015 that <120 <13816 <13 be
dressed.

57:25 And it came to pass that <1296 were two hundred, out of my two
<199 and sixty, who had fainted <1529 of the loss of <9409
<82 <182 to the goodness of God, and to our <88
<14468 and also the joy of our <1489 <959 <43 was not one
soul of them who did <36700 yea, and <2065 was <15 one soul <83
them who had not <996 many wounds.

57:26 And now, <92 preservation was astonishing to our <41 <41
yea, that they <102 be <3255 <4569 <34 was a <86 of our
<1839 who were <1409 And we do justly ascribe it to the <1372
<1367 of God, <101 of <42 <3863 <276 in that <266 they had
been <261 to believe—that <39 was a just God, and <15526 did not
<1813 that they <56 be <19169 by his <31074 <20280

57:27 Now this was the <39 of <283 of whom I have <27730 they are
young, and <54 <16198 are firm, and they do put <8 <30534 in God
continually.

57:28 And now it came to pass that <241 we had thus <225 care of our
<234 men, and had <20774 our dead and also the dead of the
<414 who were <22019 <349 we did <559 of Gid <559 the
<498 whom they had started to go down to the land of <13284
with.

57:29 Now Gid was the <3428 <14586 over the band who was <3562 to
<721 them down to the <3558

57:30 And now, <117 are the <425 <159 Gid said unto me: <2157 we
did start to go down to the land of <54 with our <4132 And
it came to pass that we did meet the <3093 of our <13304 who had been
sent out to <3099 the camp of the <749

57:31 And they <21902 unto us, saying—Behold, the <1544 of the
<388 are <9832 <9120 the city of Cumeni; and <131 they
will fall upon <619 yea, and will <4255 our <2505

57:32 And it came to pass that our <146 did hear <202 <38044
<103 <404 them to take courage; and they did rise up in rebellion
<1413 us.

57:33 And it came to pass <294 of <30 <16 we did <1654 that
our <8032 <277 come upon <556 And it came to pass that they did in
a body run upon our <1186 in the which, the <3378 <1348 of them
were <7947 and the <660 of them <22399 <7106 and fled from us.

57:34 And <113 when they had fled and we <977 not <2471 <117 we
took our <1640 with <2010 <137 the city <136 and <23 we did
<758 in time that we <2350 <3806 our <404 in <16041 the
<2828

57:35 And <23 we are <1928 <8264 out of the <2094 of our
<13606 And <21194 is the name of our God; for <22 it is he that
has <25 us; yea, that has done this <518 <1055 for us.

57:36 Now it came to pass that when I, <3890 had <5316 <291 <289
of Gid, I was <11278 with <459 joy <170 of the <557 of God
in <83 us, that we <92 not all <542 yea, and I <418 that
the <18896 of them who have been <1787 have <7108 into the rest of
<205 God.

Alma <1768 58

58:1 And <94 now it came to pass that our next object was to <5791
the city of <24010 but <19 <519 was no way that we <181 lead them
out of the city by our <5498 bands. For <20 they <34337 that
<289 we had <7148 <15481 <769 we <25 not <9096 them away from
<71 <3481

58:2 And they were so much more <987 than was our army that we
<2733 not go <2963 and <3465 them in <28 <28

58:3 Yea, and it <1132 <1195 that we <308 <1272 our men to the
<9856 <855 <5024 of the land <68 we had regained of our
possessions; <71 it <27 <27 that we <27 wait, that we
<169 <1540 more <2039 from the land of <470 and also a new
<1068 of <1449

58:4 And it came to pass that I thus did send an <17498 to the
<11471 of our <6381 to acquaint him <574 the <4456 of our
<443 And it came to pass that we did wait to <59 <1113 and
<61 from the land of <1186

58:5 But <167 this did profit us but little; for the <499 were
also <3315 <300 <26 from day to day, and also many
provisions; and thus were our <5057 at this <7326 of <7508

58:6 And the <32 were sallying <169 <482 us from time to
<2466 resolving by <3326 to <527 us; <15160 we <215 not
come to <1740 with <425 <324 of <190 retreats and <3
<194

58:7 And it came to pass that we did wait in <357 difficult
<64 for the <2513 of many months, even <2899 we were <1141 to
<13468 for the want of food.

58:8 But it came to pass that we did <140 food, <221 was <4983 to
us by an army of two <879 men to our <13241 and this is all
the <17472 <23 we did receive, to <4469 <2044 and our
<4196 from <1306 into the <479 of our <14281 yea, to <3071
with an <37130 <26 was innumerable.

58:9 And now the <606 of <98 our embarrassments, or the <7 why
they did not send more <186 unto us, we knew not; <293 we were
<35563 and also <474 with fear, lest by any <9599 the <32488 of
God <306 come upon our <266 to our <12334 and <6929 <6929

58:10 <1549 we did pour out our <480 in <36412 to God, that he
<1605 <4464 us and <2139 us out of the <99 of our <99
yea, and also give us <73 that we <352 <6940 our <2105 and our
<7127 and our <7123 for the <1422 of our <319

58:11 Yea, and it came to pass that the Lord our God did <37115 us with
assurances that he <62 <59 us; yea, <1653 that he did <17459
<11437 to our souls, and did <6160 unto us <322 <16822 and did <147 us
that we <119 hope for our <21168 in him.

58:12 And we did take <9453 with our <533 <1738 <189 we had
<23279 and were <19013 with a determination to <4201 our <112
and to <1867 our <101 and our <101 and our <17125 and our
<5669 and the <58 of our <11779

58:13 And thus we did go <367 with all our <138 <371 the
<1035 who were in the city of <615 and we did <11061 our <11061 by
the <14501 side, <73 was near to the <771

58:14 And it came to pass that on the <9651 that when the <419
saw that we were in the <3680 by the <35 <34 was near the
<2309 that they sent out <409 <1005 <2080 <381 us that they <74
<33150 the <883 and the <222 of our <3455

58:15 And it came to pass that when they saw that we were not <2222
<1332 to our <1874 and <2674 that we <182 cut them off from
<51 <244 <7212 they <10 come out to <476 <126 us and kill
us, and also <4762 that they <493 <16146 <499 us with <25
<696 <11418 <355 they <1999 to make <2420 to come out
<30 us to <4317

58:16 And when we saw that they were <8500 <21 to come out
<21 us, <595 I <1047 that Gid, with a <239 <110 of men,
<70 secrete <10732 in the <3412 and also that Teomner and a
<18 <18 of men <17 <17 <1942 also in the <3498

58:17 Now Gid and his men were on the <3482 and the others on the left;
and when they had thus <25504 <8461 <63 I remained, with
the <1046 of my <1420 in that same <2724 <6517 we had <5172 pitched
our <247 <87 the time that the <225 <62 come out to
<116

58:18 And it came to pass that the <18 did come out with <150
<150 army <32 us. And when they had come and were <236 to fall
upon us with the <3106 I <134 that my men, <834 who were with me,
<55 <9864 into the <115

58:19 And it came to pass that the <54 did <7276 <1399 us with
<428 speed, for they were <5617 <4046 to <1131 us that
they <288 slay us; <218 they did <24 us into the <14869
and we did pass by in the <23543 of Gid and Teomner, <480 that they
were not <9994 by the <1316

58:20 And it came to pass that when the <66 had <2266 by, or
when the army had <8 by, Gid and <221 did rise up from <134
<19330 <37738 and did cut off the <368 of the <31 that they
<117 not <3327 to the <420

58:21 And it came to pass that when they had cut them off, they ran to
the city and fell upon the <6536 who were left to <1465 the <420
<98 that they did <348 them and did take <2729 of the
<49 Alma 58:22 Now this was done <851 the <67 did <3515
<83 <1680 <260 save a few <41 only, to be led away into the
<195

58:23 And it came to pass that Gid and <116 by this <736 had
<3349 <52 of <37 <888 And it came to pass that we
took our <32535 <215 <6391 traveled much in the <510 <1332
the land of <993

58:24 And when the <74 saw that they were <1488 <19 the
land of <2754 they were <240 afraid, lest <1198 was a plan
laid to lead them on to <6211 <244 they <462 to <286
into the <51 <3817 yea, even back by the same way <569 they
had <21459

58:25 And <393 it was <2622 and they did <628 <97 tents, for the
<1644 <6074 of the <73 had <4590 that the <5784 were
<33200 <158 of <20 march; and <532 that they had <2009 <8
<163 army <67 they took no <11260 <1128 the city of <2016

58:26 Now it came to pass that when it was <2739 I <385 that my men
<263 not <6485 but that they <6 <1481 <16422 by <7495 way
<133 the land of <38

58:27 And <67 of this our <20 in the <6227 <101 on the
<2335 we were <32717 the <742 <263 that we did <1507 <2200
them at the city of <36

58:28 And thus it came to <15688 that by this <1134 we did take
<233 of the city of <26345 <29060 the <5155 of <5481

58:29 And it came to pass that when the <1710 of the <151 did
<56 near the <328 and saw that we were <4592 to meet <1167 they
were <16742 <230 and <23855 with <479 <1028 <83 that
they did flee into the <313

58:30 Yea, and it came to pass that the <50 of the <50 did
flee out of all this <5756 of the <1845 But <130 they have <14268
with them many <7821 and <9189 out of the <16

58:31 And <567 <4728 <263 had been <1942 by the <149 all of
them are at this <1286 of time in our possession; and our <3856 and
our <40 and our <41 are returning to <250 homes, all save it be
<42 who have been <41 <1806 and <66 off by the <545

58:32 But <79 our <97 are <745 to <984 so <126 a <750 of
<71 and so <8 possessions.

58:33 But <23 we <1623 in our God who has <6064 us <9397 over
<53 <1013 <154 that we have <444 <7 <31 and <3
<11 <106 were our own.

58:34 Now we do not know the <1026 that the <7670 does not <1097
us more <3529 <2215 do <30 men who came up unto us know why we
have not <2219 <1842 <4750

58:35 <2006 we do not know but what ye are unsuccessful, and ye have
<38339 away the <3388 into that <200 of the <13638 if so, we do not
<3166 to murmur.

58:36 And if it is not so, <116 we fear that <492 is some faction
in the <20805 that they do not send more men to our <1379
for we know that they are more <820 than that <123 they have sent.

58:37 But, <42 it <30969 not—we <160 God will <1231 us,
<2816 the <5273 of our <2076 yea, and <11 us out of
the <1302 of our <1879

58:38 <117 this is the <3349 and <3348 <3348 in the <11034 end, and
we are in the <399 of our <8251 and the <329 have fled to
the land of <6140

58:39 And <175 sons of the <3454 of <9386 of whom I have so <17818
<24513 are with me in the city of <1208 and the Lord had <13555
<407 yea, and kept them from <1485 by the <921 <252 that even
one soul has not been <2394

58:40 But <124 they have <219 many wounds; <1614 they
<4499 fast in that <4212 <32176 God has made them free; and they
are <34904 to <2674 the Lord <358 God from day to day; yea, they do
<2713 to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his <8917
<29422 and <24 <2397 is <3354 in the <26811 <630
that <196 is to <687

58:41 And now, my <4390 <6181 <4390 may the Lord our God, who
has <20878 us and made us free, keep you <6330 in his presence;
yea, and may he <13702 this <3035 even that ye may have success in
<3188 the <189 of all that <56 the <189 have <441
from us, <8 was for our support. And now, <134 I <7778 mine
<8207 I am <2078 the son of Alma.

Alma <2030 59

59:1 Now it came to pass in the <6342 year of the <3625 of the
<6377 over the <225 of <4067 <869 <6339 had <178 and had read
Helaman’s <3719 he was <617 <10113 <714 of the <38720
yea, the <2123 <90 <74 <4171 had had, in <93 <261
<11585 <9 were lost.

59:2 Yea, and he did make it <3992 unto all his <123 in all the land
<1415 <1179 in that part <1232 he was, that they <1132 <6000 <28784

59:3 And it came to pass that he <2796 sent an <3849 to
Pahoran, <9020 that he <806 <510 men to be <4191 <4191 to
<1686 <135 or the <583 of <5 <298 that he <43
with ease <589 that part of the land <86 he had been so
miraculously prospered in regaining.

59:4 And it came to pass when <137 had sent this <60 to the land
of <986 he <968 <2314 to lay a plan that he <50 <2197 the
<1342 of <135 <15730 and <606 <50 the <227 had <227
from <2431

59:5 And it came to pass that <2775 <49 was thus <1447 <1447
to go <1327 the <27 to <12999 <244 the <205 of <12966
who were <114 <114 from the city of <27 and the city of Lehi
and the city of <12977 were <17533 by the <719

59:6 Yea, even <73 who had been <4283 to flee from the land of
<6024 and from the land <199 <3841 had come over and <4107 the
<66 in this part of the <817

59:7 And thus <3619 <265 <25855 yea, and <2112 <1630
from day to day, by the <3135 of <3274 they came <1728 <101 the
<97 of <97 and they did <39216 to slay them with an <34
<780 <17030

59:8 And <445 <219 were so <638 that the <165 of the <31
of <13135 were <3559 to flee <1015 <3169 and they came even and
<86 the army of <7167

59:9 And now as <144 had <1134 that <702 <274 be men sent to
the city <70 to the <2069 of the <47 to <267 that
<1001 and <26973 that it was easier to keep the city from <591 into
the <676 of the <138 than to <11809 it from <610 he <49
that they <1940 <1704 <36 that <1349

59:10 <2025 he <3177 all his <1907 to <14 <193 <12386
<265 he had recovered.

59:11 And now, when <86 saw that the city of <117 was lost he
was <145 sorrowful, and <309 to <3000 <448 of the
<14999 of the <420 <5036 they <109 not fall into the <79
of <160 <23389

59:12 Now this was the case with all his <1274 captains. They doubted
and marveled also <40 of the <39 of the <39 and this
<10 of the <493 of the <117 over <345

59:13 And it came to pass that <87 was <14551 with the <869
<26 of <60 indifference <660 the <13531 of <6 <6703

Alma <579 60

60:1 And it came to pass that he <8774 <415 to the <2452 of the
<2187 who was <491 and <2234 are the <2691 <149 he <6892 <4918
<857 I <34166 mine <449 to <17 in the city of <450 who
is the <109 <14523 and the <38 over the <37 and also to all
<186 who have been <22802 by this <246 to govern and manage the
<2504 of this war.

60:2 For <439 I have <6923 to say unto them by the way of
condemnation; for <15 ye <8752 know that ye have been
<3080 to <21433 <457 men, and arm them with <2912 and with
<26951 and all <13138 of <4717 of war of <3534 <36588 and send
<395 <395 the <1227 in <3880 <2638 they <226 come into
our <434

60:3 And now <56 I say unto you that <33696 and also my men, and
also <700 and his men, have <3466 <274 <418 sufferings;
yea, even hunger, <34306 and <13148 and all <63 of <6426 of
<62 <6427

60:4 But <44 were this all we had <31 we <349 not murmur nor
complain.

60:5 But <19 <43 has been the slaughter <3398 our <8827 yea,
<14398 have <4754 by the <983 <604 it <634 have <25647 been
if ye had rendered unto our <482 <3918 <523 and succor for
<290 Yea, <38 has been your neglect <1527 us.

60:6 And now <52 we <1184 to know the <741 of this <104
<24 neglect; yea, we <13 to know the <13 of your thoughtless
<29812

60:7 Can you <5237 to sit upon your thrones in a <29837 of <19
stupor, <79 your <19419 are spreading the work of <3777 <18576 you?
Yea, <13 they are murdering <102 of your brethren—

60:8 Yea, even they who have looked up to you for protection, yea, have
<4420 you in a situation that ye <123 have succored <511 yea, ye
<7 have sent <122 unto <9 to have <26098 <4 and have
saved <50 of them from <546 by the sword.

60:9 But <124 this is not all—ye have withheld your <2815 from
<29 <856 that many have <3880 and bled out <423 lives <433
of <5 <139 <26042 <395 they had for the <19432 of this <204
yea, and this they have done when they were <940 to <2735 with
<265 <31 of your <171 <31 <191 <191 <199

60:10 And now, my <1121 brethren—for ye <36690 to be beloved; yea, and
ye <8 to have <14752 <376 more <32230 for the <55 and
the <497 of this <59 but <97 ye have neglected them <90
that the <4447 of <121 <8386 come upon your <25373 for vengeance;
yea, for <1023 unto God were all <99 <3371 and all <4 sufferings—

60:11 <496 <2375 ye <4819 that ye <5 sit upon your thrones, and
<94 of the <1078 <3197 of God ye <15 do <24305 and he
<348 <1395 you? <30 if ye have <708 this ye have <4 in
vain.

60:12 Do ye <45 <4366 <37 so many of your <3315 have been
killed it is <12 of <70 wickedness? I say unto you, if ye have
<36 this ye have <4 in <9629 for I say unto you, <807 are
many who have <389 by the <3919 and <5627 it is to your
<534

60:13 For the Lord suffereth the <24460 to be <3270 that his <9916
and <30715 may come upon the <31543 <1964 ye need not <84
that the <23 are lost <77 they are <3454 but <181 they do
<4604 into the rest of the Lord <91 God.

60:14 And now <19 I say unto you, I fear <248 that the
<2879 of God will come upon this <756 <43 of <29 <169
slothfulness, yea, even the slothfulness of our <741 and <12
<28 <276 <276 <276 <6 <4848 yea, <4 <673
who have been <1478

60:15 For were it not for the <800 <329 <2476 <15449 at our
head, we <210 have withstood our <447 that they <7 have <11008
no <3893 over us.

60:16 Yea, had it not been for the war <35 <3565 out <565 ourselves;
yea, were it not for <774 <14395 who <2083 so much bloodshed <15
<16 yea, at the time we were <27123 <10 ourselves, if we
had united our <572 as we <3383 have <3384 yea, had it not been
for the <551 of <67 and <9385 <55 <108 <14898 had over us;
had they been true to the <565 of our <22558 and <39 with us, and
gone <730 <730 our <2888 <4790 of <10972 up <143 <3689
<10 us, <37 was the <27 of so much <82 <72 <81
yea, if we had gone <29 <19 them in the <77 of the <10047 we
<762 have dispersed our <41 for it <357 have been <37056
<2797 to the <7514 of his <37117

60:17 But <238 now the <969 are <8967 upon us, <66
<1557 of our <1932 and they are <616 our <880 with the
<718 yea, our <2024 and our <2962 and also <6605 them away
captive, causing them that they <65 <2447 all <786 of
<10857 and this <269 of the <255 <233 of <143 who are
<24356 for <153 and authority, yea, even <11 king-men.

60:18 But why <34 I say much <1021 this matter? For we know not
but what ye <542 are <32 for authority. We know not but what
ye are also traitors to your <1044

60:19 Or is it that ye have <553 us <70 ye are in the <19842 of
our <3297 and ye are <6438 by <18786 that ye do not <188
food to be sent unto us, and also men to <1538 our armies?

60:20 Have ye forgotten the <1776 of the Lord your God? Yea,
have ye <12 the <37448 of our fathers? Have ye <8 the
many <5068 we have been <3810 out of the <1200 of our enemies?

60:21 Or do ye <473 that the Lord will <5024 <583 us, <814 we
sit upon our <841 and do not make use of the <2598 <278 the Lord
has provided for us?

60:22 Yea, will ye sit in idleness <33 ye are <115 with
<678 of those, yea, and tens of thousands, who do also sit in
idleness, <21 <582 are <18 <1500 <759 in the <3134 of the
land who are <825 by the <261 yea, <4244 and bleeding?

60:23 Do ye <91 that God will look upon you as guiltless <38 ye
sit <99 and <614 <443 things? Behold I say unto you, Nay. Now I
<339 that ye <250 <1962 that God has said that the inward vessel
<762 be cleansed first, and then <6 the <32786 <11 be <9
<1766

60:24 And now, <3149 ye do <10470 of that <135 ye have <379 and
<1547 to be up and <20107 and send <411 food and men unto us, and also
unto <1766 that he may <3184 <324 <1180 of our <266 <34 he
has regained, and that we may also recover the <1565 of our
<1731 in <103 parts, <106 it will be <3831 that we <3580
no more with the <426 <3657 we have <610 <87 our <103
vessel, yea, even the <389 head of our <15807

60:25 And <96 ye <2352 mine <1931 and come out and show unto me a
true <25671 of <541 and strive to <321 and <5621 our
<2249 and <26 unto them food for <541 <7138 <71 I will <5652
a part of my <15877 to <1553 this part of our <1377 and I will
<18 the <540 and the <20463 of God upon <1041 that none <5674
<460 can operate <559 them—

60:26 And this <413 of <50 <752 <3528 and <4 <35099 in
<4 tribulations—

60:27 And I will come unto you, and if <290 be any <603 you that has
a <659 for <99 yea, if <14 be even a spark of <1020
remaining, <93 I will stir up insurrections <26 you, even <159
<200 who have <1102 to <29778 <75 and <688 <258 <8512
<25573

60:28 Yea, <29 I do not fear your <18 nor your <554 but it
is my God whom I <26567 and it is <643 to his <471 that I
do take my <5258 to <3816 the <505 of my <20540 and it is <119
of your <11790 that we have <1384 so much <4882

60:29 <355 it is <3948 yea, the time is now at <5293 that <228 ye
do bestir <595 in the <11579 of your <296 and your <5100
ones, the <57 of <982 doth hang over you; yea, and it <108 fall
upon you and <3732 you even to your <3812 <3812

60:30 <1096 I wait for <1839 from you; and, <53 ye do
<5122 unto our relief, <741 I come unto you, even in the land
of <1638 and <19045 you with the <474 <1192 that ye can have
no more <152 to impede the <35852 of this <755 in the <132 of our
<16053

60:31 For <46 the Lord will not <750 that ye <87 live and wax
<2406 in your iniquities to <3230 his <1072 <3843

60:32 <88 can you <521 that the Lord will <21631 you and come out
in <1107 <304 the <1622 when it is the <37547 of <295
<2842 that has <972 <6 hatred, yea, and it has been redoubled by
<263 who have <20190 from us, <556 your <206 is for the <89
of your love of <20587 and the vain <9454 of the world?

60:33 Ye know that ye do <24346 the laws of God, and ye do know
that ye do trample them <24251 your feet. <94 the Lord <9864 unto
me: If <61 whom ye have <1740 your governors do not <565 of
<83 sins and <37560 ye <137 go up to <3723 <108 <1413

60:34 And now <158 I, <2533 am constrained, <319 to the
<8500 <559 I have made to keep the <328 of my God;
<1240 I <647 that ye <647 adhere to the word of God, and send
speedily unto me of your <1514 and of your men, and also to
<6598

60:35 And <57 if ye will not do this I come unto you speedily; for
<14 God will not <228 that we <51 <1510 with hunger;
<61 he will give unto us of your <4238 even if it must be by the
<1586 Now see that ye <37361 the word of God.

60:36 <152 I am <115 your <1945 captain. I seek not for <14099
but to pull it <22804 I seek not for honor of the <20463 but for the
<217 of my God, and the <518 and <1544 of my <993 And thus I
<2631 mine <2630

Alma <2044 61

61:1 <59 now it came to pass that soon <2610 <2080 had sent his
<2025 unto the <71 governor, he <2619 an <8 from <2033
the <10 governor. And <734 are the <2054 <197 he received:

61:2 I, <18 who am the <19 <2042 of this <665 do send <23
<22 unto <113 the <13 <5085 over the <4010 <64 I say unto
you, <13 that I do not joy in your <754 <1150 yea, it
grieves my <31355

61:3 But <193 <639 are <297 who do joy in your <21 yea,
<462 that they have risen up in <4979 <292 me, and also
<22 of my <463 who are <16559 yea, and <9 who have <21 up
are <1453 <7689

61:4 And it is <16 who have <11034 to take away the <16716
from me that have been the <409 of this <82 <32471 for they have
used <7 flattery, and they have led away the <16494 of many <1516
<146 will be the <27 of sore affliction <720 us; they have <1839
our <6402 and have daunted our <822 that they have not come
unto you.

61:5 And <123 they have <3577 me out <2484 <822 and I have fled
to the land of Gideon, with as many men as it were <7994 that I
<1524 get.

61:6 And <36 I have sent a <23601 <18997 this part of the
<3228 and <14 they are flocking to us <8047 to <463 <10975 in the
<707 of <7 <707 and <3 <833 and to <10725 our wrongs.

61:7 And they have come unto us, <196 that <160 who have <176 up
in <198 <198 us are set at defiance, yea, <17 that they do
fear us and <4898 not come out <19 us to <4086

61:8 They have got <1447 of the <292 or the <2565 of <6009
they have <550 a king over <134 and he hath <11725 unto the king
of the <653 in the <189 he hath <2628 an alliance with him; in
the <11 <7 he hath agreed to <1006 the city of <756
<12 <28102 he <11460 will enable the <1088 to <4470 the
<1114 of the <65 and he <596 be <2106 king over this <297
when they <10 be conquered <637 the <2797

61:9 And now, in your <412 you have censured me, but it <3343
not; I am not <10838 but do <2986 in the <20559 of your <26875 I,
<417 do not seek for <512 save only to <4636 my <321
that I may <11095 the <9701 and the <3247 of my <793 My soul
standeth fast in that <11 in the <102 God hath made us free.

61:10 And now, <242 we will resist <1574 even unto <17103
We <665 not shed the <2067 of the <124 if they <10 stay in
<248 own <2431

61:11 We <12 not shed the <22 of our <2009 if they <10 not
rise up in <246 and take the <978 <231 us.

61:12 We <18 <11267 <4858 to the yoke of <21666 if it were
<33298 with the <999 of God, or if he <682 <2900 us so to do.

61:13 But <1107 he doth not <14 us that we <186 <40 <40
to our <1750 but that we <29 put our <3519 in him, and he will
<1534 us.

61:14 <17265 my <2219 <3340 <566 let us <130 <31472 and
<2550 evil we <14930 <8 with our <10877 yea, such as
rebellions and <24799 let us <13 them with our <2594 that we
may <201 our <388 that we may <225 in the <511 privilege of
our <21130 and in the <503 of our Redeemer and our God.

61:15 <66 come unto me <838 with a few of your men, and
<1321 the <309 in the <6365 of Lehi and Teancum; give unto them
<1076 to <35305 the war in that part of the <328 <904 to the
<34337 of God, <249 is also the <7 of <772 <7 is in <933

61:16 <1208 I have sent a few <895 unto <411 that they may not
<866 <1302 ye can come unto me.

61:17 Gather <2720 <142 <2961 ye can upon your <4089 hither,
and we will go <96 <240 <499 <16504 in the <1412 of
our God <73 to the <3538 <63 is in us.

61:18 And we will take <486 of the city of <440 that we may
<3278 more food to send <1582 unto Lehi and <124 yea, we will go
<10 <52 them in the <51 of the <2003 and we will put an end
to this <190 <21673

61:19 And now, <240 I do joy in <3202 your <1545 for I was
<2848 <33708 <1929 what we <277 do, <3027 it <4 be
just in us to go <54 our <3028

61:20 But ye have <21521 <1301 they <1112 the Lord hath <9066 you
that ye <30 go <24 <177

61:21 See that ye <1583 Lehi and <14343 in the <9120 tell them to
fear not, for God will <328 <189 yea, and also all <160 who <3733
fast in that <476 <3734 God hath made them <474 And now I <990
mine <546 to my <349 <349 <3237

Alma <996 62

62:1 And now it came to pass that when <995 had <986 this <28
his <2004 did take <7782 and was <5249 with <887 <152 joy
<1489 of the <36755 of <569 that he was not also a traitor
to the <290 and <354 of his <1062

62:2 But he did also mourn <35 <32 of the <1314 of <100
who had <847 <17486 from the <17499 yea, in fine <17 of
<15 who had <40190 <150 <550 <801 and also <4 God.

62:3 And it came to pass that <92 took a <4180 <4175 of men,
<295 to the <1659 of <81 and gave Lehi and <173 <513
over the <406 of his <4641 and took his <335 <2441 the land of
Gideon.

62:4 And he did <22097 the <16829 of <177 in <361 <4922 he
did enter, and <2432 <8 <369 he <914 in all his <35
<36 the land of <35

62:5 And it came to pass that <2027 did flock unto his standard,
and did take up <105 <2363 in the <916 of <6 <525 that they
<2880 not come into <13000

62:6 And <9092 when <116 had <3608 <431 <62 men he
<63 in all his <8547 he came to the land of Gideon; and uniting his
<4208 with <163 of <175 they <5772 <189 <5173 even
stronger than the men of Pachus, who was the king of <20 <17009
who had <199 the <1065 out of the land of <5784 and had <3704
<451 of the <747

62:7 And it came to pass that <78 and <52 went down with <101
<2975 into the land of <473 and went <456 <228 the <964 and
did meet the men of <65 <1002 that they did come to <993

62:8 And <824 Pachus was <2736 and his men were <64 <6729 and
<50 was <18349 to his judgment-seat.

62:9 And the men of <25 <351 <62 trial, <256 to the law,
and also <109 <2572 who had been <34 and cast into prison; and
they were executed <22 to the law; yea, <20 men of <34 and
<6 <2643 <6540 <830 not take up arms in the <210 of
<48 <1877 but <13 <7204 <104 it, were put to <7227

62:10 And thus it <182 <2123 that this law <502 be strictly
<36530 for the <20398 of <32 <29154 yea, and <47 was <9781
<32180 <9 <409 was <652 <70 <70 to the law.

62:11 And thus <7707 the <4080 year of the <4080 of the <4079 over
the <1059 of <9907 <188 and <138 <4951 <138 <5602 to the
land of <186 <1302 <44 own <1315 <13 inflicted <3221 upon
all <107 who were not true to the <466 of <1846

62:12 And it came to pass in the <7741 of the thirty and <2211
year of the <63 of the <63 over the <62 of <4142 <62
<4065 <1818 that <781 <117 be sent, and also an army of
six <5864 men <12 be sent unto <2294 to <6345 him in
<6262 that part of the <294

62:13 And he also <38 that an army of six <31 men, with a
<3390 quantity of <1677 <38 be sent to the <303 of Lehi and
<15023 And it came to pass that this was done to <2260 the land
<210 the <1198

62:14 And it came to pass that <94 and <527 <9245 a <15883 body
of men in the land of <159 took <159 <490 with a <15 body of
men <496 the land of <3894 <3990 <7597 to <5880 the
<1147 in that <3858

62:15 And it came to pass that as they were <5133 <29 the <955
they took a <41 body of men of the <1335 and slew many of <751
and took <60 <166 and <3 <3635 of war.

62:16 And it came to pass <1718 they had <357 <24 they <151 them
to <3107 into a <1903 that they <333 no more take up <34 <34
of war <131 the <8833

62:17 And when they had <6434 into this <27 they sent them to
<12281 with the <238 of <4605 and they were in <682 <2630 four
<199 who had not been <3099

62:18 And it came to pass that when they had sent them away they

that when they had come to the city of <170 they did <5224 <26
<5606 in the <15595 of <11 <1032 is near the city of <34

62:19 Now <223 was <5535 that the <192 <267 come out to
<2050 <117 <140 upon the plains; but the <175 <4095 of
<43 <638 <862 <869 and <9297 the <1434 of <9
<5815 <1982 they <1570 not come out <29 <4162 <8 they
did not come to <39 in that day.

62:20 And when the <5310 came, <63 went <616 in the <38605 of the
<5261 and came upon the top of the wall to spy out in what part of the
city the <87 did camp with <64 <1891

62:21 And it came to pass that they were on the <31087 by the <21363

that part of the <745 yea, even on the <20395 <4602 the <113 did
not camp with <115 <14401

62:23 And it came to pass that they were all let down into the city by
<161 by the <2985 of <27 <101 <101 and <4 ladders; thus when
the <9289 came they were all <11675 the <16674 of the <442

62:24 And now, when the <62 <11640 and saw that the <529 of
<106 were <25 the walls, they were affrighted <8875
<825 that they did flee out by the pass.

62:25 And now when <26 saw that they were fleeing <1945 him, he did

thus were the <5722 relieved from a <471 burden; yea, <213 that
they were <11 from all the <54 of the <745

62:30 Now it came to pass that <177 <654 he had <162 <161

62:44 And <988 did <266 to his judgment-seat; and <76 did take
upon him <756 to <22042 unto the <69 the word of God; for <155
of so many wars and <18805 it had <182 <1818 that a

1:22 And now when <26 saw that he was in <72 of the city
of <3826 and saw that the <135 had fled <62 <94 and were
<12751 and were <770 and were cast into <21220 and that he had
<3118 the <35 of the <13071 hold in all the <1401 his
<229 took <9602 <74 that he was <809 to go <153 <85 all
the <1488

1:23 And now he did not tarry in the land of <70 but he did
<179 <26 with a <429 <3569 even <3743 the city of <14864 for
it was his <9637 to go <19 and cut his way <10398 with the
<5938 that he <497 <939 the <23668 <1470 of the <59

1:24 And, <444 that <248 <18040 <433 was in the center of
the <95 <829 he did <61 <2346 <27256 them no time to <17495
<705 <273 save it were in <4526 bodies; and in this <563
they did fall upon them and cut them down to the <2752

1:25 But <703 this <41 of <191 <80 the <54 of the
land gave Moronihah <329 <14916 over <183 <2273 the
<3013 of the <3891 of the <197 who were <3433

come into the <42 of the <95 but that they <841 <416 the <8143
<3118 <190 in the <1935 as they had <6940 <6939 <113
<36 had <3696 that <130 <2209 <2556 <507 <5344 <887
<148 <24 <24 by the borders.

1:27 But <59 the <55 were not <3283 <768 to his
<34818 but they had come into the <63 of the <63 and had <3351
the capital city <1348 was the city of <233 and were <4093
<128 the most <15 <53 of the <25 <21042 the <907 with a
<133 slaughter, both men, <15526 and <2070 <6913 <301 of
many <100 and of many <9295

1:28 But when <97 had <9460 <1107 he <4282 sent <257
Lehi with an army <98 <98 to head them <355 they <110 come to
the land <18463

1:29 And thus he did; and he did head them <22 they came to the land
<2083 and gave unto them <8274 <355 that they <1374 to

1:31 And now, <196 the <196 <785 not <67 <16547 way,
<2534 on the <24051 nor on the <3337 nor on the <3991 nor on the
<3906 for they were <3785 on <587 hand by the <740

1:32 And thus had <53 plunged the <44 into the <9639 of
the <831 <85 that they were in the <818 of the <10 and
he <3250 was <88 and the <26 did <19478 <396 into the

2:3 But <245 <1397 who had <1290 <1394 did lay wait to
<1449 <113 also; and he was upheld by his <1299 who had <1357
into a <4446 that no one <70 know his wickedness.

2:4 For <92 was one Gadianton, who was <317 expert in many
<5586 and also in his craft, to <2215 on the <9848 work of <15897 and
of robbery; <122 he <344 the <14837 of the band of Kishkumen.

by <4258 and <7 <21667 <570 disguise, a <16737 of <67
<43001 <588 had been laid by this band to <34 Helaman—

2:7 And it came to pass that he met <107 and he gave unto him a
sign; <81 <81 made <1512 unto him the <11041 of his <647
<8919 that he <119 <5680 him to the <80 that he <833

was the <10 of all <98 who <164 to his band to <18 and to
rob, and to gain <6006 (and this was <574 <229 plan, and <4
combination) the <57 of <57 said unto Kishkumen: Let us go
<164 unto the <346

2:9 Now this did please <112 <4101 for he did <2588 that
he <214 <29073 his design; but <333 the <38 of <180 as
they were <14192 <36 unto the <358 did stab <30 even
to the <28771 that he fell dead <4314 a groan. And he ran and told
<69 all the <2423 <197 he had seen, and heard, and <3026

2:10 And it came to pass that <22 did send <50 to take this band
of robbers and <112 murderers, that they <177 be <5142 <844

3:3 And it came to pass in the <16 and sixth, yea, <25 was much
<27 and many dissensions; in the <70 <11 were an <676
<1113 many who <3179 out of the land of <1141 and went <266
unto the land <2903 to <39540 the <1342

3:4 And they did <43120 to an <34 <33 <14430 <950 that
they came to <1397 <24401 of water and many rivers.

3:5 Yea, and even they did spread <46 into all <1184 of the <332
into whatever <7 it had not been <8784 desolate and <441
timber, <1742 of the many <1670 who had <1136 inherited the

3:6 And now no part of the land was desolate, save it were for timber;
but <32 of the <1353 of the <300 of the <171 who had
<38 inhabited the land it was <2613 desolate.

3:7 And <142 <1894 but <221 timber upon the face of the <83

<175 that they <988 to <27178 the face of the <1730 <19681 from the
sea <18734 to the sea <1187 from the sea west to the sea <4517

3:9 And the <94 who were in the land <234 did <5390 in <10550
and in <91 of <91 and they did <7272 <5959 tree <547

<1590 of <7 buildings.

3:10 And it came to pass as <35 was <171 scarce in the land
<128 they did send <140 much by the way of shipping.

3:11 And thus they did <6864 the <109 in the land <107 that
they <74 <71 many <68 both of wood and of cement.

3:12 And it came to pass that <245 were many of the <33 of <4977

3:13 And now <27 are many <2958 kept of the proceedings of this
<497 by many of this <5 <252 are <24023 and very large,
<1198 <4773

3:14 But <645 a hundredth part of the <30 of this <24
yea, the <595 of the <63 and of the <1366 and <149 <4392
and <3049 and <4371 and <8 <37948 and <3
prophecies, and <4 shipping and <3 <28647 of ships, and <5
<6 of <188 and of synagogues and <9 <188 and <3

<44635 and <4 plundering, and all <204 of <3024 and
<25290 <6784 be <45490 in this work.

3:15 But <92 <124 are many books and many <127 of <1479 <9367
and they have been kept chiefly by the <1439

3:16 And they have been <3330 down from one <3329 to <10791 by

been <17994 plundered, and hunted, and <3256 <1887 and <1491 and
scattered upon the face of the <379 and mixed with the <149
<34 they are no more <482 the <43 becoming <41040 and <29186
and ferocious, yea, even <9 <5166

3:17 And now I <929 <1404 to mine account; <2866 what I have
<876 had <11167 <1446 <114 had been <617 <185 and
disturbances, and <193 and <190 <712 the <274 of <840

3:18 The <689 and <3904 year of the <787 of the <895 ended;

3:19 And it came to pass that <43 was <8411 <43 <706 in the
<551 yea, even in the <34 and <3762 <3464 and also in the <8
and <3636 <747

3:20 Nevertheless <854 did fill the <1223 with <7055 and
equity; yea, he did <4007 to keep the <10384 and the <10384
and the <4010 of God; and he did do that <327 was <11467 in the
<42587 of God <10400 and he did walk <121 the ways of his <24503
<564 that he did <4167 in the <379

3:21 And it came to pass that he had two <15536 He gave unto the <16541
the name of <955 and unto the youngest, the name of <5281 And they
<604 to grow up unto the <25633

3:22 And it came to pass that the wars and <4507 <21 to cease,
in a <2128 degree, <187 the <187 of the <237 in the <10625 end
of the <148 and <147 year of the <190 of the <190 over the <23
of <211

3:23 And it came to pass in the <27 and <3535 year of the <27 of
the <1004 <207 was <26696 <1695 <1698 in the <206 all save
it were the <1175 combinations <160 <1106 the robber had

were not <1415 unto <1391 who were at the head of <18278 <781
they were not <13206 out of the <173

3:24 And it came to pass that in this same year <72 was <644
<280 <26763 in the <1064 <204 that <11 were <6713 who
did join <1881 unto the <4578 and were <4602 unto <38675

3:25 And so <29 was the <31 of the <31 and so many the
<8528 <87 were <32745 out upon the <572 that even the high
<31559 and the <33557 were <45 <11150 <11230 measure.

3:26 And it came to pass that the work of the Lord did <274 unto the
baptizing and <6734 to the <71 of God, many <12090 yea, even tens
of thousands.

3:27 Thus we may see that the Lord is <25989 unto all who will, in
the sincerity of <583 <33582 call upon his holy name.

3:28 Yea, thus we see that the gate of heaven is open unto all, even to
<184 who will <34491 on the name of <31607 <3616 who is the Son of
God.

3:29 Yea, we see that <6613 will may lay hold upon the word of God,

of God in the <29738 of heaven, to sit down with <47733 and <47730
and with <21314 and with all our holy <36571 to go no more out.

3:31 And in this year <280 was <363 <24599 in the land of
<1260 and in all the regions <2352 <10532 even in all the land
<84 was <16543 by the <736

<60 <22 and <21 joy in the fiftieth year of the <441 of the
<2166

3:33 And in the <27403 and <2184 year of the <18 of the <486 <36
was <35 <4255 save it were the <1456 <82 <528 to <4394 into the
church—not into the <314 of God, but into the <8115 of the <513
who <23910 to <33198 to the <17 of God—

3:34 And they were <4904 up in pride, even to the persecution of many
of <199 <3625 Now this was a <95 <7690 <57 did <1508 the more
<4908 part of the <48 to <1169 <15 persecutions, and to wade
<1998 much <17493

3:35 <728 they did fast and pray oft, and did wax <7120 and
<3 in <49 humility, and firmer and <2 in the <7568 of
<344 unto the <27630 <15 <12587 with joy and consolation, yea,
even to the purifying and the sanctification of <16 <400 <74
<6 <34588 <1389 of <8 yielding <2 <124 unto God.

3:36 And it came to pass that the <174 and <1745 year <1751 in <167
<168 save it were the <229 <98 <170 <39 had gotten into
the <36 of the <2144 and it was <48 of <46 <19 <19
<42925 and <6 <552 in the <5536 and it did grow upon them from
day to day.

3:37 And it came to pass in the <64 and <1649 year of the <238 of
the <697 <873 <4015 and his <798 son <1699 <235 to <14 in
his <23217 And it came to pass that he did fill the <893 with
<894 and <893 yea, he did keep the <884 of God, and did
walk in the ways of his <4472

<51 <1778 4

4:1 And it came to pass in the <76 and <1706 year <308 were many
<1747 in the <662 and <9 was also a <982 <831 the
<659 <703 that <11 was much <8082

4:2 And the rebellious part were <2676 and <1110 out of the <775 and
they did go unto the king of the <1088

4:3 And it came to pass that they did <39383 to stir up the <1126
to war <3119 the <3527 but <1207 the <10 were <192
<12090 <65 that they <2252 not <25316 to the <8608 of <635
dissenters.

4:4 But it came to pass in the <111 and <1101 year of the <173 of the
<187 <98 were <4510 who went up from the <2580 unto the
<4513 and they succeeded with <42 <12508 in stirring them up to
<4517 <72 the <72 and they were all that year <21091 for
war.

4:5 And in the <57 and <1124 year they did come down <28 the
<49 to <2841 and they did <18104 the work of <4022 yea,
<105 that in the <28 and <996 year of the <85 of the <510
they <71 in <11352 <2744 of the land of <3513 yea,
and also all the <4544 even unto the land <352 was near the land
<2957

4:6 And the <62 and the <3084 of <2704 were <209 even into
the land of <3263

4:7 And <139 they did <7215 <89 the <2714 from the west
sea, even unto the east; it <1799 a day’s <38466 for a Nephite, on the
line <61 they had <5751 and <16429 <398 <52 to <9341
<5 <3285 <7826

4:8 And thus <170 <186 of the <1121 with the help of a
<3572 army of the <57 had <3393 all the <118 of the
<92 <45 was in the land southward. And all this was done in the
<152 and <152 and <697 <29480 of the <154 of the <681

4:9 And it came to pass in the sixtieth year of the <19 of the
<258 <134 did succeed with his <89 in <177 many <1124
of the <492 yea, they <6557 many <3158 <65 had <1484 into the
<2954 of the <354

4:10 And it came to pass in the <14458 and <734 year of the <51 of
the <225 they <224 in regaining even the half of all <140
<12078

4:11 Now this <556 loss of the <140 and the <7 <10849 <59
was <443 <2758 <373 not have <31229 had it not been for <32
<4642 and <4 <43968 <20 was <19 <7150 yea, and it was
<7 <179 also who <763 to <763 to the <763 of God.

4:12 And it was <617 of the <634 of <35 <676 <7 of <4
<9667 <5690 yea, it was <9 of <9 oppression to the poor,
withholding <7 food from the hungry, <6 <6 clothing from
the <38817 and smiting <8 <777 <5852 upon the cheek, <11531 a
mock of that <79 was <4989 <7682 the <9781 of <35213 and of
revelation, murdering, <1717 lying, stealing, committing
adultery, rising up in <123 <1588 and deserting away into the
land of <1443 <103 the Lamanites—

4:13 And <76 of this <56 <23 <1760 and <4 boastings in
<4 own <5780 they were left in <7 own <12198 <1333
they did not prosper, but were <45370 and <36092 and <383 <2167
the <311 <1688 they had lost <311 of <2487 all <28
<20428

4:14 But <572 <273 did <6000 many <2669 unto the <887
<64 of <20 <34466 and also <727 and <21985 who were the sons
of <2497 did <24 many <24 unto the <663 yea, and did
<35625 many <10 unto them <1920 <31 <9452 and what
<2079 come unto them if they did not <5984 of <15 <44714

4:15 And it came to pass that they did <41134 and <27214 as they did
<23 they did <6978 to prosper.

4:16 For when <90 saw that they did <17 he did venture to lead
them <2016 from <3045 to <6552 and from city to <3955 even <131 they
had <375 the one-half of <65 property and the <6 of all
<8 <138

4:17 And thus <927 the <373 and <373 year of the <373 of the
<444

4:18 And it came to pass in the <22 and <955 year of the <22 of
the <446 that <84 <2735 <3815 no more <10106 over the
<428

4:19 <3141 they did abandon <62 <19196 to <19 the <1200 of
<8 <631 for so <537 were the <778 that it <2367
<23395 for the <535 to <22 more <3137 over <393 <256
<50 did <13999 all his <497 in <13998 <397 <497 <330 he
had <17326

4:20 And it came to <12730 <239 of the <2449 of the <3550 of the
<51 the <45 were in <314 <12687 lest they <220 be
overpowered, and <33959 <25660 and <1996 and <32102

4:21 Yea, they <995 to <6065 the <5175 of <5225 and also the
<853 of Mosiah; and they saw that they had been a <47290 <276
and that they had set at naught the <1000 of God.

4:22 And that they had <26102 and trampled <9129 <132 feet the laws
of <30284 or that <107 the Lord <5445 him to give unto the
<1119 and they saw that <24 laws had <6338 corrupted, and that
they had <7 a <26438 <62 <831 that they were <6 even
like unto the <197

4:23 And <138 of <32 <6598 the <548 had <23670 to dwindle; and
they <115 to <52404 in the <495 of <495 and in the <6 of
<40183 and the <10982 of God did stare them in the face.

4:24 And they saw that they had <69 weak, like unto <51 <5145
the <461 and that the <8921 of the Lord did no more <9200
<235 yea, it had <50516 from them <77 the <18 of the Lord
doth not <2531 in <50485 temples—

4:25 <292 the Lord did <30271 to <32 them by his <14882
and <28644 <3245 for they had <750 into a <11460 of <35979 and
<20975 wickedness; and they saw that the <255 were <1084 more
<314 than they, and <8827 they <257 cleave unto the Lord <90
God, they must <51685 perish.

4:26 For <542 they saw that the <4169 of the <36 was as
<290 as <26 <598 even man for man. And thus had they <67
into this <16 <34283 yea, thus had they <140 <140 <114
of <25 <34369 in the <6815 of not many <6816

<1259 <1259 5

5:1 And it came to pass that in this same <2214 <68 <595 <6223
up the <1309 to a man <4701 name was Cezoram.

5:2 For as <49 laws and <3 governments were <2028 by the
<3684 of the <273 and they who <43457 evil were more <132 than
they who <9 <30698 <435 they were ripening for <35891 for
the laws had <93 corrupted.

5:3 Yea, and this was not all; they were a <377 <42 <315
that they <514 not be <20608 by the law nor <41251 save it were to
<71 <10323

5:4 And it came to pass that <105 had <49 <7286 <142 of <18
<9783 and he <6781 up the <3419 and took it upon him to
<711 the word of God all the <547 of his <26822 and his <4994
Lehi <1538 all the <12 of his days;

5:5 For they <14598 the <473 <428 <49 <18820 <180 <27950 unto

<41760 who came out of the land of <48426 and this I have done
that when you <51 your <25 ye may <5 <398 and when ye

that it may be said of you, and also <33 even as it has been said
and <6049 of <151

<1893 who <2206 <25322 yea, <28 that he <1876 to <52751 the
<41202

5:10 And <14 also the <55 <55 <50769 <54 unto <18675 in
the city of <29967 for he said unto him that the Lord <44733 <198

in <246 <41074 but to <8 them from <7 <1066

5:11 And he hath <913 <125 unto him from the Father to <20 them
from <21 sins <427 of <42160 <492 he hath sent his
angels to <346 the <44602 of the <21418 of <29209 <87
<41317 unto the <38 of the Redeemer, unto the <41303 of <34
<46951

5:12 And now, my <168 <171 <116 that it is upon the rock of
our <27 who is <148 the Son of God, that ye must <3160 your
foundation; that when the <20961 <162 send <1118 his <5289 winds, yea,

<548 of <1428 beginning at the city <1767

5:15 And from thenceforth to the city of Gid; and from the city of Gid
to the city of <24261

5:16 And even from one city to <48717 <1291 they had gone <188 <52
all the <52 of <701 who were in the land southward; and from thence
into the land of <2474 <22 the <1054

5:17 And it came to pass that they did <710 with <880 <956
<767 that they did <48620 many of <1227 <1803 who had gone
over from the <1668 <17 that they came <64 and did confess
<300 sins and were <2801 unto <320 and <4883 <7568
to the <1231 to <2079 to repair unto them the wrongs <172 they
had <4161

5:18 And it came to pass that <99 and Lehi did <72 unto the
<974 with such <77 <277 and <11250 for they had <6 and
<7 <404 unto them that they <3492 speak, and they also had
what they <443 <14894 <16 unto <11368

5:19 <1080 they did <11 unto the <40 astonishment of the
<1128 to the <7516 <1766 <107 that <544 were eight
<7082 of the <62 who were in the land of <4772 and <2631
<4984 <115 unto <115 and were <48663 of the <1784 of
the <19643 of <133 <601

5:20 And it came to pass that <108 and Lehi did proceed from <204 to
go to the land of <3075

5:21 And it came to pass that they were <4107 by an army of the
<72 and cast into <9506 yea, even in that same prison in <169
<8620 and his <1780 were cast by the <4560 of Limhi.

5:22 And <3232 they had been cast into <26 many days <3932 <9323
<1090 they went <229 into the <12 to take them that they <169
slay <787

5:23 And it came to pass that <102 and Lehi were <8342 <134 as if
by fire, even <161 that they <5269 not lay <132 <1992 upon them
for fear lest they <201 be burned. <6381 <31 and Lehi were
not burned; and they were as standing in the <5002 of fire and were not
<23

5:24 And when they saw that they were <60 <60 with a pillar of
<61 and that it burned them not, <60 <2575 did take courage.

5:25 For they saw that the <160 <78 not lay <18 <78 upon
<971 <4181 <9 they come near unto <257 but <38230 as if they were
<14266 dumb with amazement.

5:26 And it came to pass that <98 and Lehi did <5920 <157 and <1462
to <301 unto <34 <13105 Fear not, for <172 it is God that has
<48438 unto you this <16236 <21653 in the <217 is <10 unto you
that ye <605 lay your <75 on us to slay us.

5:27 And <37 when they had said <612 <4899 the <26831 <46627
<4635 and the <5718 of the <220 did shake as if they were
<143 to tumble to the <6662 but <32 they did not <654 And
<7 they that were in the <28 were <138 and <466 who
were <2515

5:28 And it came to pass that they were overshadowed with a cloud of
<37448 and an <1477 solemn fear came upon <274

5:29 And it came to pass that <421 came a <1363 as if it were <46140
the <33 of <32 <146 Repent ye, <1921 ye, and seek no more
to <4877 my <347 whom I have sent unto you to <877 good
tidings.

5:30 And it came to pass when they <7355 this <35954 and <20784 that it
was not a <58 of <46775 <237 was it a <7 of a <504
tumultuous noise, but <128 it was a <3699 <13 of <21686 mildness,
as if it had been a whisper, and it did <8520 even to the very soul—

5:31 And <5660 the mildness of the <60 <1176 the <198
<199 <198 and the <198 of the <170 trembled <5304 as if it
were <198 to <198 to the <198 and <26 the <130 of <130
<258 had <172 <281 did not disperse—

5:32 And <18 the <78 came <35 <148 <148 ye, <148 ye, for
the <3254 of <3370 is at hand; and seek no more to <156 my
<26359 And it came to pass that the <77 <76 <33 and the <76
trembled.

5:33 And also <3883 the <2934 time the <52 <9513 and did <350 unto
them <336 <915 <76 <327 be uttered by man; and the <32 did
<50811 <39 and the <44 <44 as if it were <110 to <3391
asunder.

5:34 And it came to pass that the <302 <1569 not flee <995 of
the <125 of <9563 <48 did overshadow <446 yea, and also they
were immovable <18 of the fear <15 did come upon <299

5:35 Now <294 was one <864 them who was a <30574 by <4220 who had
once <5072 to the <1920 of God but had <11798 from <31

5:36 And it came to pass that he <18255 him <3368 and <259 he saw
<1290 the <75 of <75 the faces of <492 and <20396 and <16
they did <44529 <238 even as the <15 of angels. And he <311
that they did lift <549 eyes to heaven; and they were in the <50323
as if talking or lifting <16 <28255 to some <2765 whom they beheld.

5:37 And it came to pass that this man did cry unto the multitude, that
they <703 turn and look. And <69 <127 was <889 <870 unto them
that they did turn and look; and they did <280 the <79 of <94 and
<3942

5:38 And they said unto the man: <1636 what do all these things mean,
and who is it with whom <10 men do converse?

5:39 Now the man’s name was Aminadab. And Aminadab said unto them: They
do converse with the angels of God.

5:40 And it came to pass that the Lamanites said unto him: What shall
we do, that this cloud of darkness may be removed from overshadowing
us?

5:41 And <50 said unto <50 You must repent, and cry unto the
voice, even until ye <37 have faith in Christ, who was taught unto
you by Alma, and Amulek, and Zeezrom; and when ye <20 do this, the
<56 of <56 <8 be <56 from <56 you.

5:42 And it came to pass that they all did begin to cry unto the voice
of him who had shaken the earth; yea, they did cry even <68 the <43
of <44 was dispersed.

5:43 And it came to pass that when they cast their eyes about, and saw
that the <27 of <26 was dispersed from <69 them,
behold, they saw that they were encircled <22 yea every soul, by a
pillar of fire.

5:44 And Nephi and Lehi were in the midst of them; yea, they were
<29 about; yea, they were as if in the <16 of a flaming fire,
yet it did harm them not, neither did it take hold upon the walls of
the prison; and they were filled with that joy which is unspeakable and
full of glory.

5:45 And <88 the Holy Spirit of God did come down from heaven, and
did enter into <121 hearts, and they were <38 as if with <65 and
they could speak forth marvelous words.

5:46 And it came to pass that there came a <187 unto <139 yea, a
pleasant <250 as if it were a whisper, saying:

5:47 Peace, peace be unto you, because of your <264 in my Well
Beloved, who was from the foundation of the world.

5:48 And now, when they heard this they cast up <85 eyes as if to
behold from whence the <64 came; and <114 they saw the heavens
open; and <370 came down out of heaven and ministered unto them.

5:49 And <93 were about three hundred souls who saw and <50 <420
things; and they were bidden to go <125 and marvel not, <192 should
they doubt.

5:50 And it came to pass that they did go forth, and did minister unto
the people, declaring throughout all the regions round <53 all the
<478 <210 they had <54 and seen, insomuch that the more part of
the <445 were convinced of <166 <145 of the greatness of the
evidences <27 they had received.

5:51 And as many as were <24 did lay down <140 weapons of war,
and also <7 hatred and the tradition of <6 fathers.

5:52 And it came to pass that they did yield up unto the Nephites the
lands of <23 possession.

Helaman Chapter 6

6:1 And it came to pass that when the sixty and second year of the
reign of the judges had ended, all <164 <116 had happened and the
<107 had become, the more part of <110 a righteous <143
<127 that <55 righteousness did exceed that of the <67
<125 of <11 firmness and <3 steadiness in the faith.

6:2 For <242 <220 were many of the <23 who had become hardened
and impenitent and grossly wicked, <43 that they did reject the
word of God and all the preaching and prophesying <165 did come among
<263

6:3 Nevertheless, the people of the church did have great joy <68
of the conversion of the Lamanites, yea, <9 of the <17 of God,
<36 had been established <37 <36 And they did fellowship one with
another and did rejoice one with another, and did have <41 joy.

6:4 And it came to pass that many of the <145 did come down into
the land of Zarahemla, and did declare unto the <77 of the <119
the manner of <140 conversion, and did exhort them to <419 and
repentance.

6:5 Yea, and many did preach with exceedingly <60 power and
authority, unto the bringing down many of them into the depths of
humility, to be the humble followers of God and the Lamb.

6:6 And it came to pass that many of the <86 did go into the land
northward; and also <625 and Lehi went into the land northward, to
<64 unto the people. And thus ended the <280 and third year.

6:7 And <230 <230 was <522 in all the land, <221 that the
<117 did go into whatsoever part of the land they would, whether
<182 the <15 or the Lamanites.

6:8 And it came to pass that the <79 did also go whithersoever
they <27 <27 it were <28 the <13 or <4 the Nephites;
and thus they did have free intercourse one with <212 to buy and to
sell, and to get gain, according to <183 desire.

6:9 And it came to pass that they became <176 rich, both the
<47 and the <46 and they did have an exceeding plenty of
gold, and of silver, and of all <224 of precious metals, both in the
land south and in the land north.

6:10 Now the land <13 was called Lehi and the land north was <7
Mulek, <317 was after the son of Zedekiah; for the Lord did bring
Mulek into the land north, and Lehi into the land south.

6:11 And <185 <185 was all <67 of gold in both <469 lands, and
of <81 and of <78 ore of <870 kind; and <22 were also
curious workmen, who did work all kinds of ore and did refine it; and
thus they did <451 rich.

6:12 They did raise grain in abundance, both in the <94 and in the
south; and they did flourish exceedingly, both in the <14 and in the
<85 And they did multiply and wax <174 strong in the land.
And they did <42 many flocks and herds, yea, many fatlings.

6:13 Behold <210 women did toil and spin, and did make all <114 of
cloth, of fine-twined linen and cloth of <108 kind, to clothe <24
nakedness. And thus the <332 and fourth year did pass away in peace.

6:14 And in the <16 and fifth year they did also have <425 joy and
peace, yea, much <554 and many prophecies concerning that <204
was to come. And thus passed away the <31 and <31 <379

6:15 And it came to pass that in the <16 and sixth year of the <674
of the judges, <212 Cezoram was murdered by an unknown hand as he
sat upon the judgment-seat. And it came to pass that in the same year,
that his son, who had been appointed by the <540 in his stead, was
also murdered. And thus <453 the <58 and <58 <74

6:16 And in the commencement of the <14 and seventh year the <31
began to grow <197 wicked again.

6:17 For <79 the Lord had blessed them so long with the riches of
the world that they had not been stirred up to anger, to wars, nor to
bloodshed; therefore they <43 to set <194 hearts upon <3 riches;
yea, they <11 to seek to get gain that they might be lifted up one
above another; <29 they <18 to commit secret murders, and to
rob and to plunder, that they <24 get gain.

6:18 And now <84 those murderers and plunderers were a band who had
been formed by Kishkumen and Gadianton. And now it had come to pass
that <378 were many, even <533 the Nephites, of Gadianton’s band. But
<38 they were more numerous <13 the more <137 part of the
<581 And they were <462 <22 robbers and murderers.

6:19 And it was they who did murder the chief judge Cezoram, and his
son, while in the judgment-seat; and <46 they were not found.

6:20 And now it came to pass that when the <560 found that <79
were <51 <66 them they were <205 sorrowful; and they did
use <367 means in <169 <761 to destroy them off the face of the
earth.

6:21 But <56 Satan did stir up the <194 of the more part of the
<122 <707 that they did unite with <160 bands of robbers, and
did <1300 into <47 covenants and <3 oaths, that they would protect
and preserve one <891 in <729 difficult circumstances they
<1175 be placed, that they <5 not suffer for <26 <219 and
<4 plunderings, and <3 stealings.

6:22 And it came to pass that they did have <15 signs, yea, <3
<246 <5 and <5 <4 words; and this that they <245
distinguish a brother who had entered into the covenant, that
<64 wickedness his <12 <58 do he <3 not be injured by
his brother, nor by <105 who did belong to his band, who had taken
this covenant.

6:23 And thus they <50 murder, and <301 and steal, and <314
whoredoms and all <555 of wickedness, contrary to the laws of <77
country and also the laws of <8 God.

6:24 And whosoever of <57 who belonged to <13 band <73 reveal
unto the <404 of <9 <87 and <3 abominations, <12 be
tried, not <825 to the laws of <12 country, but <8 to the
laws of <9 <61 <562 had been given by Gadianton and
Kishkumen.

6:25 Now <236 it is <745 <150 oaths and <212 <22 Alma
commanded his son <49 not go <1383 unto the world, lest they <9
be a <282 of <1036 down the <505 unto destruction.

6:26 Now <40 <94 <38 <38 and <38 did not come <32
unto <61 from the records <48 were delivered unto Helaman; but
<23 they were put into the heart of <19 by that same being
who did entice our first parents to partake of the forbidden fruit—

6:27 Yea, that same <21 who did plot with Cain, that if he <304
<413 his <233 Abel it <89 not be known unto the <1553 And he
did plot with Cain and his <1120 from that time forth.

6:28 And also it is that same <47 who put it into the <379 of the
<121 to build a tower sufficiently high that they <252 get to
heaven. And it was that same <29 who led on the <24 who came from
that <26 into this land; who spread the works of <1809 and
abominations over all the face of the <1131 <1851 he dragged the <30
down to an entire destruction, and to an everlasting hell.

6:29 Yea, it is that same <56 who put it into the <165 of <165
to still carry on the work of darkness, and of <206 murder; and he
has brought it <207 from the beginning of man even down to this time.

6:30 And <209 it is he who is the author of all sin. And <12 he
doth <48 on his <101 of <101 and <47 <385 and doth hand
down <318 plots, and <3 <508 and <3 covenants, and <3 plans
of awful <331 from generation to <2 <343 as he can
get hold upon the <181 of the children of men.

6:31 And now <58 he had got <935 hold upon the <20 of the
<1185 yea, <577 that they had <1066 <624 wicked; yea,
the more part of them had turned out of the way of righteousness, and
did trample under <72 feet the commandments of God, and did turn unto
<11 own ways, and did <244 up unto themselves idols of <11 gold
and <4 silver.

6:32 And it came to pass that all <419 iniquities did come unto them
in the space of not many years, <80 that a more part of it had
come unto them in the <928 and <928 year of the <1000 of the <1674
over the <256 of Nephi.

6:33 And they did grow in <66 <53 in the <29 and eighth year
also.

6:34 And thus we see that the <1404 did <2164 to dwindle in
unbelief, and grow in <545 and <544 <806 the <785
<912 to grow <155 in the knowledge of <46 God; yea, they did
<30 to keep his statutes and commandments, and to walk in truth and
uprightness before him.

6:35 And thus we see that the <2073 of the Lord <45 to withdraw from
the <786 <1669 of the <62 and the hardness of <52
hearts.

6:36 And thus we see that the Lord <29 to pour out his <38 upon
the <1702 <32 of <26 easiness and willingness to believe in
his <2097

6:37 And it came to pass that the <109 did hunt the band of
<895 of Gadianton; and they did <1586 the word of God <905 the
more <972 part of <1842 <210 that this band of <24 was
utterly destroyed from <19 the <984

6:38 And it came to pass on the other hand, that the <180 did <278
them up and support <38 <425 at the more <46 part of <8
<490 they had overspread all the land of the <138 and had seduced
the more part of the <1907 <20 they had come down to <115 in
<123 <432 and <641 of <5 spoils, and to join with them in <8
<442 murders and combinations.

6:39 And thus they did obtain the sole management of the government,
<111 that they did <380 <380 <28 feet and smite and rend and
turn <9 backs upon the poor and the meek, and the <1775 <655
of God.

6:40 And thus we see that they were in an <485 state, and ripening for
an <590 <774

6:41 And it came to pass that thus <1314 the <343 and <343 year of
the <373 of the <373 over the <372 of <372

<2081 <2081 7

7:1 Behold, now it came to pass in the <34 and ninth year of the
<34 of the <34 over the <34 of the <170 that Nephi, the
son of Helaman, returned to the land of Zarahemla from the land
northward.

7:2 For he had been <643 <243 the <33 who were in the land
<1865 and did <279 the word of God unto <227 and did prophesy
many <2134 unto <2506

7:3 And they did <2079 all his words, <181 that he <2434 not stay
<45 <28 but <68 again unto the land of his nativity.

7:4 And seeing the <61 in a state of such <169 <654 and
<932 <738 <324 filling the judgment-seats—having usurped the
<1234 and authority of the <801 laying aside the <605 of God,
and not in the least aright <459 him; doing no justice unto the
<676 of men;

7:5 Condemning the <306 <422 of <249 righteousness; letting
the guilty and the <341 go unpunished <13 of <13 money; and
moreover to be held in office at the head of <293 to rule and do
<733 to <22 wills, that they <898 get gain and glory of the
<1048 and, moreover, that they <13 the more easily <1160 adultery,
and <1166 and kill, and do <32 to <32 own wills—

7:6 Now this <751 iniquity had come upon the <231 in the <675 of
not many years; and when <2077 saw it, his <884 was swollen with
sorrow within his breast; and he did exclaim in the agony of his soul:

7:7 Oh, that I <203 have had my days in the days when my father <41
<1076 came out of the land of Jerusalem, that I <23 have joyed with
him in the promised <189 then were his <217 easy to be entreated,
firm to keep the <199 of God, and slow to be led to do
iniquity; and they were quick to hearken unto the words of the Lord—

7:8 Yea, if my days <55 have been in <253 days, then <1124 my soul
have had joy in the <2427 of my brethren.

7:9 But <905 I am consigned that <830 are my <28 and that my soul
<2947 be <2764 with <142 <234 of this the <702 of my
<33

7:10 And <33 now it came to pass that it was upon a tower, <1236
was in the garden of <425 <8 was by the highway <5 led to the
<1614 market, <7 was in the city of Zarahemla; therefore, <165 had
bowed himself upon the <1144 <16 was in his garden, <5 <7 was
also near unto the <44 gate by <11 led the highway.

7:11 And it came to pass that <1629 were certain men passing by and saw
<47 as he was pouring out his soul unto God upon the tower; and they
ran and told the <207 what they had <2711 and the <7 came
together in multitudes that they <329 know the cause of so <311
mourning for the <143 of the <2366

7:12 And now, when <57 arose he beheld the <30 of <37 who
had gathered together.

7:13 And it came to pass that he opened his mouth and said unto <3181
<608 why have ye <25 yourselves together? That I may tell you
of your iniquities?

7:14 Yea, <211 I have got upon my <149 that I <84 pour out my
soul unto my God, <18 of the <2323 <234 of my heart, <159 is
<11 of your iniquities!

7:15 And <9 of my <108 and lamentation ye have <63
<64 together, and do marvel; yea, and ye have <126 need to
<9 yea, ye ought to <2907 <29 ye are <1558 away that the
devil has got so <22 hold upon your <985

7:16 Yea, how <345 you have <23 way to the enticing of him who is
seeking to hurl away your <2965 down to <781 misery and endless
wo?

7:17 O repent ye, <2 ye! Why will ye die? Turn ye, turn ye unto the
Lord your God. Why has he forsaken you?

7:18 It is <84 you have <2787 your hearts; yea, ye will not
<432 unto the <3053 of the good shepherd; yea, ye have provoked him
to anger against you.

7:19 And <382 instead of gathering you, except ye will <3394
<10 he <413 scatter you <778 that ye <6 <1321 meat for dogs
and wild beasts.

7:20 O, how <128 you have forgotten your God in the very day that he
has <1651 you?

7:21 But <44 it is to get <2577 to be praised of men, yea, and that
ye <246 get gold and <1326 And ye have set your <1392 upon the
<2196 and the vain <826 of this <685 for the <253 ye do <1463
and <1849 and <683 and bear false witness <114 your neighbor,
and do all <1854 of iniquity.

7:22 And for this <381 wo <108 come unto you <125 ye <6 repent.
For if ye will not <132 <87 this <249 city, and also all <584
<7 cities <58 are <3147 <3420 <4 are in the land of our
possession, <33 be <1930 away that ye <6 have no place in <912
for <38 the Lord will not grant unto you strength, as he has
hitherto done, to withstand <89 your enemies.

7:23 For <25 thus saith the Lord: I will not show unto the <848
of my <32 to one more than the other, save it be unto <82 that
<294 of <809 sins, and <261 unto my <1295 Now <586 I <678
that ye <1799 <46 my brethren, that it <84 be better for the
<1303 than for you <135 ye <12 <135

7:24 For <24 they are more <922 than you, for they have not
sinned <91 that <139 <1433 <135 ye have received; <2358
the Lord will be merciful unto <127 yea, he will lengthen out <74
days and increase <5 seed, even when thou shalt be <1329 <1329
<59 thou <7 <59

7:25 Yea, wo be unto you <371 of that <51 abomination <51 has
come <1063 you; and ye have united <489 unto it, yea, to that
<1284 band <19 was <3119 by Gadianton!

7:26 Yea, wo <105 come unto you <39 of that pride <19 ye have
suffered to <2256 your <3555 <9 has <2460 you up beyond that
<8 is good <24 of your <1549 <64 riches!

7:27 Yea, wo be unto you <15 of your <667 and abominations!

7:28 And <102 ye <195 ye <58 perish; yea, even your <3344 <6
be <272 from you, and ye <8 be <124 from off the face of the
<2358

7:29 <2765 now, I do not say that <876 <379 <24 be, of myself,
<58 it is not of myself that I know <16 <3518 but <211 I
know that <8 <24 are true <21 the Lord God has made them
<2049 unto me, <210 I testify that they <42 be.

<1336 <1336 8

8:1 And now it came to pass that when <768 had said <43 <1259
<51 <841 were men who were <2744 who also <2258 to the <189
band of Gadianton, and they were angry, and they cried out <274 him,
saying unto the people: Why do ye not seize upon this man and <3008 him
<3586 that he may be condemned <1162 to the crime <193 he has
done?

8:2 Why seest thou this man, and hearest him revile <47 this <841
and <5 our law?

8:3 For <85 <92 had spoken unto them <2867 the corruptness
of <318 law; yea, many <145 did <16 <3793 <50 cannot be written;
and nothing did he <10 <10 was <2389 to the <1127 of God.

8:4 And <433 <1460 were angry with him <175 he spake plainly unto
them <49 <45 <130 <1618 of darkness; nevertheless, they
durst not lay <11 own hands upon him, for they feared the <87 lest
they <452 cry out <91 <3459

8:5 Therefore they did cry unto the <3572 <3840 Why do you <2562
this man to <119 <23 us? For <3807 he doth condemn all this
<21 even unto destruction; yea, and also that <212 our <343
<598 <240 be <313 from us, that we <7 have no <586 in <57

8:6 And now we know that this is impossible, for <155 we are
powerful, and our <34 great, <280 our enemies can have no <1471
over us.

8:7 And it came to pass that thus they did stir up the <114 to <821
<88 <1179 and raised contentions <474 <518 for <286 were some
who did cry out: Let this man alone, for he is a good man, and <179
<208 <195 he <641 will surely come to pass <427 we repent;

8:8 Yea, <85 all the judgments will come upon us <24 he has
testified unto us; for we know that he has <9 <1545 unto us
<211 our iniquities. And <161 they are <2904 and he knoweth as
well all <58 <34 <147 befall us as he <12 of our iniquities;

8:9 Yea, and <58 if he had not been a prophet he <895 not have
<50 <46 <92 things.

8:10 And it came to pass that <12 <136 who sought to <2863 <314
were compelled <287 of <270 fear, that they did not lay <7 <276
on him; <185 he <2047 <1686 to <326 unto <1693 <1679 that he had
gained favor in the eyes of some, <1714 that the remainder of them
did fear.

8:11 <293 he was constrained to <33 more unto them <295
<1220 my <764 have ye not read that God gave <233 unto one man,
even Moses, to <1928 upon the waters of the Red Sea, and they parted
hither and thither, <57 that the Israelites, who were our fathers,
came through upon dry ground, and the <28 closed upon the armies of
the Egyptians and swallowed them up?

8:12 And now <163 if God gave unto this man such power, then why
<393 ye dispute <277 yourselves, and say that he hath <1196 unto me
no <85 whereby I may know <181 the <252 that <214 come
upon you <270 ye repent?

8:13 But, <49 ye not only deny my <603 but ye also deny all the
<1597 <243 have been <525 by our <98 and also the <11 <11
were <11 by this man, <134 who had such <421 <60 <66 unto
him, yea, the <20 <20 he hath <20 <67 the coming of the
Messiah.

8:14 Yea, did he not bear record that the Son of God <109 come? And
as he <818 up the brazen serpent in the wilderness, even so <101 he
be <14 up who <23 <3461

8:15 And as many as <10 look upon that <27 <5 live, even so
as many as <8 look upon the Son of God with faith, having a
contrite spirit, <1193 <22 even unto that life <92 is eternal.

8:16 And now <147 Moses did not only <776 of <540 things, but
also all the holy prophets, from his days even to the days of Abraham.

8:17 Yea, and <31 Abraham saw of his coming, and was <1716 with
gladness and did rejoice.

8:18 Yea, and <439 I say unto you, that <26 not only knew of
<57 <57 but <522 were many <2009 the days of <16 who were
<3339 by the order of God; yea, even <3804 the <7 of his Son; and
this that it <126 be shown unto the <643 a <214 many thousand
years <39 his <75 that even redemption <18 come unto <634

8:19 And now I <1159 that ye <14 know, that even since the days of
<64 <72 have been many prophets that have <492 <83 <943
yea, <120 the <505 Zenos did <151 boldly; for the <169 he was
slain.

8:20 And <19 also Zenock, and also Ezias, and also Isaiah, and
Jeremiah, (Jeremiah <2895 that same <33 who <42 of the
destruction of Jerusalem) and now we know that Jerusalem was <1034
<896 to the <309 of Jeremiah. O then why not the Son of God come,
<16 to his prophecy?

8:21 And now will you <414 that <34 was destroyed? Will ye say
that the sons of Zedekiah were not slain, all <405 it were Mulek?
Yea, and do ye not <208 that the seed of <20 are with us, and
they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem? But <111 this is not
all—

8:22 Our <2078 Lehi was <22 out of <64 <621 he <113
of <157 <648 <632 also <7 of <6 <246 and also almost
all of our <445 even down to this time; yea, they have <20 of
the <427 of <4984 and have looked forward, and have rejoiced in his
day <186 is to <400

8:23 And <74 he is God, and he is with <664 and he did manifest
<1985 unto <8 that they were redeemed by him; and they gave unto
him glory, <86 of that <42 is to <42

8:24 And now, <698 ye know <91 <778 and <1041 deny them <157
ye <469 lie, <720 in this ye have sinned, for ye have rejected
all <23 <114 notwithstanding so many <4668 <42 ye have
<1418 yea, even ye have received all <16 both <41 in <4897
and all <6 <20 are in the earth, as a <1629 that they are true.

8:25 But <112 ye have <49 the truth, and rebelled <938 your
holy God; and even at this time, <1762 of <2439 up for <1416
treasures in <49 where <1128 doth corrupt, and <5 <5 can
come <55 is unclean, ye are heaping up for <23 wrath <40
the day of judgment.

8:26 Yea, even at this time ye are ripening, <148 of your <2738
and your fornication and <2512 for <1896 <1083 yea,
and <142 ye <1401 it will come unto you soon.

8:27 Yea, <303 it is now even at your doors; yea, go ye in unto the
judgment-seat, and search; and <115 your <3827 is murdered, and he
lieth in his blood; and he hath been <4074 by his <3654 who
seeketh to sit in the <4074

8:28 And <33 they both <3665 to your <1221 <3666 whose <3285 is
<2593 and the evil one who <29 to <962 the <1992 of men.

<1406 <1406 9

9:1 <914 now it came to pass that when <352 had <758 <237 <803
<2244 men who were <849 them ran to the <3907 yea, even
<538 were five who went, and they said <17 themselves, as they went:

9:2 <44 now we will know of a surety <4528 this man be a <521
and God hath <3641 him to <2734 such <5147 <269 unto us.
<28 we do not <2947 that he hath; yea, we do not <8 that he
is a prophet; <1337 if this thing <240 he has said <846
the <2382 <169 be true, that he be dead, then will we <29 that the
<3036 <561 <24 he has <112 are <313

9:3 And it came to pass that they ran in <1101 might, and came in unto
the <123 and <183 the <48 <48 had fallen to the <352
and did lie in his blood.

9:4 And now <22 when they saw this they were astonished
<4450 <1061 that they fell to the <5430 for they had not
believed the <76 <76 <188 had <76 <100 the <51 judge.

9:5 But now, when they saw they believed, and fear came upon them lest
all the <1035 <29 <29 had <29 <749 come upon the people;
<472 they did quake, and had <87 to the <1717

9:6 Now, immediately when the <101 had been murdered—he <723 stabbed
by his <3742 by a garb of secrecy, and he fled, and the servants ran
and told the <826 raising the cry of <3766 <249 <1392

9:7 And <378 the <1274 did gather <3484 <2490 unto the <1468
of the judgment-seat—and <135 to <169 astonishment they saw <1293
five men who had <77 to the <77

9:8 And now <22 the <36 knew <480 <133 the multitude
who had <2405 <42 at the <2591 of Nephi; <111 they said
<65 themselves: These men are they who have <409 the judge, and
God has smitten them that they <1368 not flee from us.

9:9 And it came to pass that they laid hold on <666 and bound them and
cast them into prison. And <371 was a proclamation sent abroad that
the <155 was <811 and that the <4377 had been <1592 and were
cast into <26

9:10 And it came to pass that on the morrow the <108 did assemble
<145 <103 to mourn and to fast, at the burial of the <999
<254 <49 who had been <946

9:11 And thus also <157 <1733 who were at the <132 of <1588 and
<5391 his <469 were also <146 <43 at the burial.

9:12 And it came to pass that they inquired <152 the <225 <1420
Where are the five who were sent to inquire <183 the <62 <62
<468 he was dead? And they answered and said: Concerning this five
whom ye say ye have sent, we know not; but <145 are five who are the
murderers, whom we have cast into <134

9:13 And it came to pass that the <99 desired that they <344 be
brought; and they were brought, and <290 they were the five who were
sent; and <10 the <25 <94 of them to <1118 <84 the
matter, and they told them all that they had <2346 <108

9:14 We ran and came to the <323 of the <698 and when we saw
all <565 even as <411 had testified, we were <464 <462
that we fell to the <463 and when we were recovered from our
astonishment, <68 they cast us into <108

9:15 Now, as for the <390 of this man, we know not who has done it;
and only this much we <92 we ran and came <1125 as ye desired,
and <42 he was <595 <10 to the <514 of <3463

9:16 And now it came to pass that the <130 did expound the matter
unto the <228 and did cry out <871 <261 <126 <667 we know
that this <109 must have agreed with some one to slay the <396 and
then he <1425 <5398 it unto us, that he <7 convert us unto his
<1444 that he <9 <5023 <1059 to be a <329 man, chosen of God,
and a prophet.

9:17 And now <470 we will detect this man, and he <1045 confess his
fault and make <2238 unto us the true murderer of this <618

9:18 And it came to pass that the five were liberated on the day of the
<353 <5555 they did rebuke the <124 in the <142 <627
they had <628 <120 <120 and did contend with them one by one,
<225 that they did confound <1404

9:19 <35 they caused that <136 <310 be <468 and <497 and
<4225 <1431 the multitude, and they <1851 to question him in divers
ways that they <129 cross him, that they <5 accuse him to death—

9:20 Saying unto him: Thou art confederate; who is this man that hath
done this murder? Now tell us, and acknowledge thy fault; saying,
<2413 here is <3502 and also we will <2696 unto thee thy life if thou
wilt tell us, and <25 the agreement <116 thou hast made with
him.

9:21 But <98 said unto <3118 O ye fools, ye uncircumcised of <3077
ye blind, and ye stiffnecked <265 do ye know how long the Lord your
God will <2215 you that ye <207 go on in this your way of sin?

9:22 O ye <3076 to <4092 to howl and mourn, <1151 of the <255
<1497 <73 at this time doth await you, <1148 ye <37 <2651

9:23 <111 ye say that I have <313 with a man that he <185 <395
Seezoram, our <555 <253 But <278 I say unto you, that this is
<50 I have <1409 unto you that ye <182 know <495 this
thing; yea, even for a <1295 unto you, that I did know of the
<2622 and <4509 <75 are <616 you.

9:24 And <40 I have done <6410 ye say that I have <73 with a man
that he <74 do this <47 yea, <22 I showed unto you this sign
ye are <2418 with me, and seek to <1177 my life.

9:25 And now <96 I will show unto you <4960 sign, and see if ye
will in this <1093 seek to <28 me.

9:26 <141 I say unto you: Go to the house of Seantum, who is the
<950 of <143 and say unto him—

9:27 Has <366 the pretended prophet, who doth <1164 so much evil
<140 this <240 <103 with thee, in the <127 ye have <888
<34 who is your brother?

9:28 And <86 he <210 say unto you, Nay.

9:29 And ye <11 say unto him: Have ye <31 your <27

9:30 And he <15 stand with <2257 and wist not what to say. And
<40 he <14 deny unto you; and he <6 make as if he were
astonished; <1222 he <10 <555 unto you that he is
innocent.

9:31 But <32 ye <16 examine him, and ye <5 find blood upon the
skirts of his cloak.

9:32 And when ye have seen <227 ye <21 say: From <6363 cometh this
blood? Do we not know that it is the <35 of your <98

9:33 And then <26 he tremble, and <4 look pale, even as if death
had come upon him.

9:34 And then <18 ye say: Because of this fear and this paleness
<174 has come upon your face, <93 we know that thou art guilty.

9:35 And then <30 greater fear come upon him; and then <8 he
<640 unto you, and deny no more that he has done this murder.

9:36 And then <22 he say unto you, that I, <249 know <1143
<242 the <751 save it were <2240 unto me by the <2246 of God.
And then <28 ye know that I am an honest man, and that I am sent unto
you from God.

9:37 And it came to pass that they went and did, even <822 as
<551 had said unto <662 And <114 the <688 <123 he had said were
true; for <20 to the <12 he did deny; and also <9 to the
<10 he did confess.

9:38 And he was <682 to prove that he <798 was the very murderer,
<715 that the five were set at liberty, and also was <883

9:39 And <1056 were some of the <4519 who <1414 on the <49 of
<1268 and <15 were some also, who <13 <474 of the testimony
of the five, for they had been converted <4714 they were in <973

9:40 And now <30 were some <530 the <413 who said that <123 was
a <867

9:41 And <19 were others who <1139 <929 he is a god, for <627 he
was a god he <1313 not know of all <2031 For <152 he has told us
the thoughts of our <3238 and also has told us <2206 and even he
has <139 unto our <3351 the true <899 of our <647 <647

<1731 <1731 10

10:1 And it came to pass that <74 <3903 a division <94 the <94
<163 that they divided <2633 and thither and went <1447 <4949
leaving <105 <2853 as he was standing in the <6922 of <234

10:2 And it came to pass that <21 went his way towards his own house,
pondering upon the <1158 <253 the Lord had <2347 unto him.

10:3 And it came to pass as he was thus pondering—being much cast down
<197 of the <708 of the <1386 of the <4313 <73 <1857
<3079 of <5177 and <7 murderings, and <3 <5600 and all
<3656 of iniquities—and it came to pass as he was thus <65 in
his <868 <170 a <3808 came unto him <1126

10:4 Blessed art thou, <400 for <1406 <84 <84 thou hast done;
for I have <4047 how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word,
<18 I have <415 unto <660 unto this <4076 And thou hast not
<3141 <1522 and hast not <2892 thine own life, but hast <6 my
will, and to keep my commandments. <204 10:5 And now, <115 thou
hast done this with such unwearyingness, <83 I will bless thee
forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in <6579 and
in works; yea, even that all <94 <477 be done unto thee <419
to thy <87 for thou <3584 not ask that <92 is <3264 to my will.

10:6 <328 thou art <127 and I am God. <8 I <690 it unto
thee in the presence of mine angels, that ye <49 have <534 over this
<282 and <8 <2924 the earth with famine, and with pestilence, and
<5415 <64 to the <222 of this <143

10:7 <46 I give unto you <2893 that <5774 ye <32 seal on
<33 <5 be sealed in heaven; and <13 ye <8 loose on <12
<5 be loosed in <13 and thus <7 ye have <66 <347 this
<46

10:8 And thus, if ye <16 say unto this temple it <6 be rent in
twain, it <7 be done.

10:9 And if ye <10 say unto this mountain, Be thou cast down and
<4043 smooth, it <14 be <24

10:10 And <204 if ye <11 say that God <4 <125 this <130 it
<6 come to pass.

10:11 And now <23 I command you, that ye <16 go and <171 unto
this <26 that thus <3265 the Lord God, who is the Almighty: Except
ye <2294 ye <23 be smitten, even unto <4984

10:12 And <40 now it came to pass that when the Lord had <1364
<2210 <613 unto <225 he did stop and did not go unto his own <449
but did return unto the <4403 who were scattered <7166 upon the
face of the <5641 and <1360 to <80 unto them the word of the Lord
<280 had been <50 unto him, <796 <436 <1235 if they
did not <1230

10:13 Now <78 <2511 that <1252 miracle <25 <513 had
done in telling them <27 the <908 of the <585 <1550 they did
harden <37 <4159 and did not <4005 unto the <96 of the Lord.

10:14 <3251 <35 did <72 unto them the word of the Lord,
<474 <147 ye <4129 thus <159 the <9 ye <150 be <1985 even
unto <151

10:15 And it came to pass that when <38 had <477 unto them the
<393 <87 they did <5727 <68 <68 <68 and <2905 not <68
unto his <6122 <2043 they did <3593 <1536 him, and did seek to
lay <22 <3363 upon him that they <1314 cast him into <773

10:16 But <43 the <331 of God was with him, and they <745 not
take him to cast him into prison, for he was <1555 by the <5440 and
conveyed away out of the <684 of <684

10:17 And it came to pass that thus he did go <4380 in the Spirit, from
<2139 to <1583 <7402 the word of God, even <5359 he had
<119 it unto them all, or sent it <27 <407 all the <407

10:18 And it came to pass that they <129 not <129 unto his <128
and <781 <264 to be contentions, <778 that they were <779
<137 <2089 and <13 to slay one <1359 with the sword.

10:19 And thus <5316 the seventy and <4983 year of the <5281 of the
<1711 over the <738 of <970

<639 <843 11

11:1 And now it came to pass in the <34 and <7397 year of the
<35 of the <34 that the <3704 did increase, <75 that
<83 were wars <7529 all the land <113 all the <50 of <50

11:2 And it was this <794 band of <5240 who did <5930 on this work
of <360 and wickedness. And this war did last all that year; and
in the <67 and <7184 year it did also last.

11:3 And it came to pass that in this year <305 did cry unto the <330
<339

11:4 O <8 do not <1678 that this <78 <343 be <3140 by the
sword; but O <16 rather let <101 be a famine in the <455 to stir
them up in remembrance of the Lord <319 God, and perhaps they will
<531 and turn unto thee.

11:5 And so it was <2128 <701 to the <425 of <132 And <45 was
a <462 <47 upon the <47 <148 all the <70 of <16 And thus
in the <118 and <6970 year the <20 did continue, and the work of
<146 did cease by the sword but <7217 sore by famine.

11:6 And this work of <19 did also continue in the <38 and
<6962 <6888 For the <737 was <465 that it was dry, and did not
<7667 <330 <7112 in the season of grain; and the whole <22 was
<638 even <83 the <4508 as well as <6 the <1021 so
that they were <39 that they did perish by thousands in the more
<4577 parts of the <7119

11:7 And it came to pass that the <121 saw that they were <639 to
<31 by <858 and they <361 to remember the Lord <179 God; and
they <10 to <10 the <164 of <148

11:8 And the <36 <14 to plead with <23 <618 <331 and <4
leaders, that they <420 say unto Nephi: <884 we know that thou art
a man of God, and <558 cry unto the Lord our God that he turn away
from us this <71 lest all the <58 <675 thou hast <700
<672 our <174 be fulfilled.

11:9 And it came to pass that the <64 did say unto <767 <252
to the <31 <31 had been desired. And it came to pass that when
<339 saw that the <97 had repented and did <5826 <489 in
sackcloth, he <4393 <3980 unto the <329 <352

11:10 O <7 <2335 this <25 repenteth; and they have swept away
the band of <3072 from amongst them <455 that they have <923
extinct, and they have concealed <139 <443 <6344 in the <2749

11:11 Now, O <41 <1145 of this <16 humility wilt thou turn away
<1173 <7115 and let <4 <4207 be appeased in the <124 of
<1226 <237 men whom thou hast already destroyed.

11:12 O <37 wilt thou turn away <27 <31 yea, thy fierce <4
and <4930 that this <357 may <349 in this <266

11:13 O <27 wilt thou <631 unto me, and <21 that it may be done
<162 to my <2676 and send <336 rain upon the face of the <3011
that she may <4523 <13 her fruit, and her <353 in the <353 of
grain.

11:14 O <50 thou didst <50 unto my <200 when I said, Let <454
be a <244 that the pestilence of the <426 <806 cease; and I know
that thou wilt, even at this <3390 <32 unto my <71 for thou
saidst that: If this <198 <511 I will spare <789

11:15 Yea, O <58 and thou <4579 that they have repented, <179 of
the <131 and the <55 and <168 <269 has come unto <29

11:16 And now, O <30 wilt thou turn away <165 <161 and try <262
if they will serve thee? And if so, O <20 thou canst <1357 them
<150 to thy <111 <42 thou hast said.

11:17 And it came to pass that in the <519 and <7406 year the Lord
did turn away his <243 from the <1157 and <2461 that rain <2202
fall upon the <181 <296 that it did <181 <181 her fruit in the
<179 of her fruit. And it came to pass that it did <19 <19 her
<198 in the <19 of her <198

11:18 And <972 the <154 did <8063 and glorify God, and the <565
face of the land was <4016 with rejoicing; and they did no more seek
to <2226 <426 but they did esteem him as a <674 <2200 and a man
of God, <4103 <9 <1017 and <6043 <1541 unto him from God.

11:19 And <60 Lehi, his <3500 was not a whit behind him as to
<1492 pertaining to righteousness.

11:20 And thus it did come to pass that the <88 of <471 <564 to
prosper <198 in the <733 and <9 to <6405 up <414 waste places,
and <9 to <7759 and spread, even <1023 they did cover the <112
face of the <27 both on the northward and on the southward, from the
sea west to the sea east.

11:21 And it came to pass that the <220 and <220 year did end in
<7747 And the <11 and <6695 year <60 in peace; and the <8255
did <6969 <964 the face of all the <5988 and the more part of
the <244 both the <1981 and the <6582 did <3622 to the
church; and they did have <5124 <166 <8124 in the <30 and thus
<1062 the <55 and <55 <804

11:22 And also they had <21 in the <15 and <6393 <7733 save it
were a few <1040 <665 the points of doctrine <333 had been
laid down by the prophets.

11:23 And in the <32 and <6391 year <460 <103 to be much strife.
But it came to pass that <194 and <227 and many of <186 brethren who
knew <49 the true <50 of doctrine, <258 many revelations
daily, <750 they did <6377 unto the <120 <354 that they
did put an end to <32 strife in that same <104

11:24 And it came to pass that in the eightieth year of the <1145 of
the <751 over the <263 of <326 <83 were a <3733 number of the
dissenters from the <14 of <14 who had some <4303 <2872 gone
over unto the <180 and <1331 upon <753 the name of
<9 and also a <34 <34 who were real descendants of the
<13 <3535 <7822 up to <460 by <1888 or by <700 dissenters,
<107 they commenced a war with <97 <6126

11:25 And they did <6331 <2751 and plunder; and then they <895
retreat back into the mountains, and into the wilderness and <772
<343 hiding <69 that they <1418 not be discovered, receiving
daily an addition to <45 numbers, inasmuch as <114 were <108
that went <491 unto <596

11:26 And thus in <650 yea, even in the <6363 of not many <7038 they
<1099 an <289 <289 band of robbers; and they did search out
all the <64 <836 of <6865 and thus they <22 <1284 of
<7862

11:27 Now <470 <1698 <11 did make <34 havoc, yea, even <4
<664 <1085 the <177 of <177 and also <7 the <7 of the
<6874

11:28 And it came to pass that it was expedient that <100 <616 be a
stop put to this work of <4074 <167 they sent an army of
<8231 men into the <146 and upon the mountains to <91 out
this band of <7795 and to <580 <131

11:29 But <85 it came to pass that in that same year they were
<4371 back even into <166 own lands. And thus <417 the <297
year of the <298 of the <297 over the <99 of <1131

11:30 And it came to pass in the <8123 of the eighty and <1507
year they did go <199 <579 <1536 this band of <76 and did
<77 many; and they were also visited with much <1729

11:31 And they were <26 obliged to <1854 out of the <116 and
out of the <118 unto <85 own <8438 <852 of the <6203
<9006 of the numbers of <318 <199 who infested the <20
and the wilderness.

11:32 And it came to pass that thus <114 this <424 And the <25
did <1771 <5763 and wax strong, <449 that they did defy the
<649 <5021 of the <1316 and also of the Lamanites; and they did
<1026 <247 fear to come unto the <142 upon all the face of the <1053

11:33 Yea, for they did visit many <1333 of the <686 and did do <31
<278 unto <3924 yea, did kill <5247 and did <1588 away <2553
captive into the <4935 yea, and more especially <123 <8461 and
<4 children.

11:34 Now this <35 evil, <601 came unto the <66 <139 of <17
iniquity, did stir them up <166 in <1543 of the Lord <13 God.

11:35 And thus <131 the <217 and <217 year of the <246 of the
judges.

11:36 And in the <18 and <1708 year they <633 <40 to forget the
Lord <40 God. And in the <17 and <1658 year they <17 to wax
<339 in <6130 And in the <15 and <1555 year they did not mend
<29 ways.

11:37 And it came to pass in the <22 and <1538 year they did wax
stronger and <2 in <25 pride, and in <4 wickedness; and thus
they were <7154 <72 for <288

11:38 And thus <107 the <35 and <35 <241

<1819 <1819 12

12:1 And thus we can <1361 how false, and also the unsteadiness of the
<2028 of the <6991 of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his
<183 infinite goodness doth <1126 and <945 <312 who put <73
trust in him.

12:2 Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth <25 his
<755 yea, in the <313 of <30 fields, <2 <8710 and <3
<8712 and in <8884 and in <8803 and in all <2638 of <8806 <1022
of <8332 kind and art; sparing <23 lives, and delivering them out of
the <2099 of <11 enemies; softening the <99 of <6 <5650 that
they <554 not <2186 wars <452 <309 yea, and in fine, <7110 all
<43 for the welfare and happiness of his <4302 yea, then is the
time that they do <2167 <37 <2848 and do <251 the Lord <7
God, and do <7386 <7386 <7 feet the Holy One—yea, and this <319
of <10 ease, and <3 <685 <151 prosperity.

12:3 And thus we see that <2911 the Lord doth chasten his <345 with
many afflictions, yea, <12 he doth <404 them with <2302 and with
terror, and with <1350 and with all <134 of <2581 they will
not <1716 him.

12:4 O how foolish, and how vain, and how <394 and devilish, and how
<7026 to do <393 and how slow to do good, are the <243 of men;
yea, how <18 to <1436 unto the <1357 of the evil one, and to set
<101 <168 upon the vain <152 of the world!

12:5 Yea, how <29 to be <5396 up in pride; yea, how <9 to boast,
and do all <90 of that <465 is <7098 and how slow are they to
<96 the Lord <47 God, and to give ear unto his counsels, yea,
how slow to walk in wisdom’s paths!

12:6 <1808 they do not desire that the Lord <30 God, who hath
created <959 <244 rule and <482 over <244 <2476 his
<192 <342 and his mercy <2988 <16 they do set at naught his
<52 and they will not that he <30 be <39 guide.

12:7 O how <31 is the nothingness of the <150 of men; yea, even
they are less than the dust of the <1748

12:8 For <820 the dust of the <1994 moveth <3081 and <5714 to
the dividing asunder, at the <2670 of our <46 and <4951 God.

12:9 Yea, <455 at his <2995 do the hills and the <738 tremble
and quake.

12:10 And by the <1438 of his <21 they are broken up, and <1825
<2749 yea, even like unto a valley.

12:11 Yea, by the <25 of his <25 doth the <745 <77 shake;

12:12 Yea, by the <16 of his <9975 do the foundations rock, even to
the very center.

12:13 Yea, and if he say unto the earth—Move—it is moved.

12:14 Yea, if he say unto the earth—Thou <2971 go back, that it
<6580 out the day for many hours—it is <3088

12:15 And <2876 <1670 to his word the <74 goeth <26 and it
appeareth unto man that the sun standeth still; yea, and <172 this
is so; for <6080 it is the <26 that <178 and not the sun.

12:16 And <22 <3401 if he say unto the <5889 of the <184 deep—Be
thou dried up—it is <2895

12:17 <297 if he say unto this mountain—Be thou <6157 up, and come
over and fall upon that <6841 that it be buried up—behold it is <31

12:18 And <54 if a man hide up a treasure in the <1733 and the
Lord <2396 say—Let it be accursed, <525 of the <7586 of him who
hath hid it up—behold, it <18 be accursed.

12:19 And if the Lord <11 say—Be thou <28 that no man <7
find thee from this time henceforth and forever—behold, no man getteth
it <8 and forever.

12:20 And <74 if the Lord <27 say unto a man—Because of <1872
iniquities, thou <206 be accursed forever—it <14 be <100

12:21 And if the Lord <11 say—Because of <22 <8292 thou <21
be cut off from my presence—he will <1016 that it <18 be so.

12:22 And wo unto him to whom he <14 say <3853 for it <5 be unto
him that will do <575 and he <5468 be saved; <6910 for this
cause, that men <2020 be saved, hath repentance been declared.

12:23 Therefore, <9290 are they who will <2012 and <590 unto the
<354 of the Lord <470 God; for <1343 are they that <55 be saved.

12:24 And may God grant, in his <252 fulness, that men <51 be
<3576 unto <52 and good works, that they <11 be restored
unto grace for grace, <328 to <45 works.

12:25 And I <1487 that all men <22 be <50 But we read that in the
<47 and last day <1372 are some who <68 be cast out, yea, who <6
be cast off from the <3334 of the Lord;

12:26 Yea, who <17 be <7699 to a <7986 of <7363 misery,
fulfilling the <705 <663 say: They that have done good <20 have
<535 life; and they that have done evil <11 have <10
damnation. And thus it is. Amen.

<1015 <1015 13

13:1 And now it came to pass in the <1037 and <1872 <1791 the <1836
did <1277 remain in <5535 yea in <104 <4 <3799 the
<2594 did observe strictly to keep the <6715 of God,
<144 to the law of Moses.

13:2 And it came to pass that in this year <135 was one Samuel, a
Lamanite, came into the land of <10117 and <1167 to <1782 unto the
<2987 And it came to pass that he did preach, many <7831 <209
unto the <1044 and they did cast him out, and he was <2626 to <1420
to his own <1331

13:3 But <379 the <271 of the Lord came unto him, that he <748
<24 again, and <4311 unto the <952 <3474 <867 <11
come into his heart.

13:4 And it came to pass that they <251 not <2879 that he <22
<7112 into the city; <1604 he went and got upon the wall thereof,
and stretched <1523 his hand and <2566 with a loud <677 and
prophesied unto the <57 <57 <57 the Lord put into his
<58

13:5 And he said unto <4636 <580 I, <153 a <152 do <6545 the
<259 of the Lord <262 he doth put into my heart; and <788 he hath
put it into my <8120 to say unto this <53 that the <2445 of <8243
hangeth over this <1129 and four <10637 <1906 pass not away save the
<18 of <18 falleth upon this <195

13:6 Yea, heavy <1480 awaiteth this <189 and it <692 <4333
unto this <8 and <4226 can save this <51 save it be
<212 and <3751 on the Lord Jesus <6032 who <25 <331 come
into the <7561 and <7 <162 many <127 and <5 be slain for his
<57

13:7 And <219 an angel of the Lord hath <3264 it unto me, and he
did <2386 glad tidings to my soul. And <22 I was sent unto you to
<1258 it unto you <759 that ye <464 have glad tidings; but <145
ye <225 not receive me.

13:8 <553 thus <3455 the <7520 <4393 of the <8823 of the
<1134 of the <107 of the <1651 <1218 they <568 I will take
away my word from <1054 and I will <8860 my <3390 from <8 and I
will <112 them no longer, and I will turn the <40 of <546
<2171 <1336 <1857

13:9 And four <195 <195 <132 not pass away <2105 I will <681
that they <11 be smitten; yea, I will <1280 them with the <210 and
with <1278 and with pestilence.

13:10 Yea, I will <19 them in my <2781 <2620 and <441 <33 be
<1480 of the <1589 <9184 who <9 <6581 of your enemies, to
<138 your utter <1957 and this <13 <212 come <117 ye
<3594 <138 the <588 and <30 of the <30 <30 <16 <47
your <1579

13:11 But if ye will <141 and <423 unto the Lord your God I will
turn away mine <68 <37 the <37 yea, thus <5 the <2682 <737
are they who will <29 and turn unto me, but wo unto him that
repenteth not.

13:12 Yea, wo unto this <578 city of <8283 for <248 it is
<926 of <79 who are <7672 that it is <802 yea, wo unto this
<24 <976 for I perceive, <59 the <59 that <135 are <1830 yea,
even the more part of this <20 <20 that will <1512 <207 <210
<207 me, <25 the <3743

13:13 But <89 are they who will <140 for them will I spare. But
<70 if it were not for the <68 who are in this <43 <43
<15 I <312 <231 that fire <536 come down out of <11094 and
<2039 it.

13:14 But <21 it is for the righteous’ sake that it is spared. But
<13 the time cometh, <74 the <99 that when ye <197 cast out
the <57 from <2212 you, then <10 ye be ripe for <231
yea, wo be unto this <69 <69 <149 of the <4127 and
<5058 <541 are in her.

13:15 Yea, and wo be unto the city of Gideon, for the <23 and
<23 <23 are in her.

13:16 Yea, and wo be unto all the <7356 <16 are in the land <7991
<7992 <8 are possessed by the <411 <60 of the <37
and <37 <13 are in <382

13:17 And <110 a curse <93 come upon the <2048 <114 the Lord of
Hosts, <30 of the people’s sake who are upon the <16 yea, <11
of <213 <42 and <3 abominations.

13:18 And it <36 come to pass, <35 the Lord of <34 yea, our
<129 and true God, that whoso <18 hide up <6460 in the <1300
<8 find them <1942 no more, <46 of the <23 <73 of the <55
save he be a <179 man and <22 hide it up unto the <271

13:19 For I <4420 <58 the <207 that they <19 hide up <78
<51 unto me; and cursed be they who hide not up <13 <12
unto me; for none hideth up <9 <9 unto me save it be the
righteous; and he that <15 not up his <16 unto me, <36 is
he, and also the treasure, and none <55 redeem it <93 of the
<93 of the <895

13:20 And the day <18 come that they <4 hide up <55 treasures,
<25 they have set <7 <378 upon <10449 and <9 they have
set <10 <10 upon <3 riches, and will hide up <6 <65
when they <34 flee <594 <8 <1960 <24 they will not hide
them up unto me, <81 be they and also <17 treasures; and in that
day <27 they be <3652 <147 the <157

13:21 <5301 ye, the <689 of this <187 <339 and <1255 unto my
<3995 yea, <6 unto the <887 <283 the Lord saith; for <279 he
<34 that ye are <54 <65 of your <83 and also are your
<8382 <11 <11 ye have set your <99 upon <713 and have not
hearkened unto the <40 of him who gave them unto you.

13:22 Ye do not <1853 the Lord your God in the <848 with <63 he
hath <513 you, but ye do always <19 your <59 not to thank
the Lord your God for <1839 yea, your <59 are not drawn out unto the
<267 but they do swell with <115 <2262 unto boasting, and unto <6
swelling, envyings, strifes, malice, persecutions and <10398 and all
<1932 of <7677

13:23 For this <544 hath the Lord God <3310 that a <243 <550 come
upon the <339 and also upon your <73 and this <127 of your
<33

13:24 Yea, wo unto this <982 <14 of this time <106 has arrived,
that ye do cast out the <7330 and do mock <152 and cast stones at
<6 and do slay <4 and do all <77 of <1621 unto <8 even
as they did of old <10049

13:25 And now when ye talk, ye say: If our days had been in the days of
our fathers of old, we <652 not have <1022 the prophets; we <7 not
have stoned <47 and cast them out.

13:26 <276 ye are worse than they; for as the Lord liveth, if a
<6730 come <640 you and declareth unto you the word of the <187
<116 testifieth of your sins and <1650 ye are <5654 with him,
and cast him out and seek all <108 of ways to <713 him; yea, you
will say that he is a <8659 <3411 and that he is a sinner, and of
the devil, <168 he <49 that your deeds are evil.

13:27 But <341 if a man <380 come <79 you and <5 say: Do <1666
and <836 is no <2171 do that and ye <14 not suffer; yea, he will
say: Walk <7458 the <8445 of your own <8857 yea, walk <9 the <9
of your eyes, and do <1311 your <1266 desireth—and if a man <34
come <54 you and say <52 ye will <1139 him, and say that he is a
<5281

13:28 Yea, ye will lift him up, and ye will give unto him of your
substance; ye will give unto him of your <2493 and of your <2494 and
ye will <11185 him with costly apparel; and <132 he speaketh
flattering <431 unto you, and he <467 that all is well, then ye will
not find <6193 with him.

13:29 O ye <3910 and ye perverse generation; ye <8976 and ye
<6026 <342 how long will ye suppose that the Lord will <1193
you? Yea, how long will ye <8 <7178 to be led by foolish and
blind guides? Yea, how long will ye choose <10354 <4358 than light?

13:30 Yea, <204 the <3273 of the Lord is <3967 kindled <1015
you; <12 he hath <542 the land <103 of your <2769

13:31 And <15 the time <1402 that he curseth your <437 that
they <2223 slippery, that ye <1887 hold <510 and in the days of your
poverty ye <12 retain <887

13:32 And in the days of your <15 ye <217 cry unto the <1165 and
in vain <9 ye cry, for your desolation is <79 come upon you, and
your <1472 is made sure; and then <20 ye weep and howl in that
day, <183 the Lord of Hosts. And then <16 ye lament, and say:

13:33 O that I had <3939 and had not killed the <505 and
<440 <440 and cast them out. Yea, in that day ye <33 say: O that
we had remembered the Lord our God in the day that he gave us our
<134 and then they <480 not have <137 slippery that we <592
lose <138 for <158 our <715 are gone from us.

13:34 <1643 we lay a tool here and on the <6836 it is gone; and
<26 our swords are <3511 from us in the day we have <5370 them for
battle.

13:35 Yea, we have hid up our <849 and they have slipped away from
us, <229 of the <663 of the <906

13:36 O that we had <4313 in the day that the word of the Lord came
unto us; for <1420 the land is cursed, and all <773 are <110
<248 and we <236 hold <236

13:37 <102 we are surrounded by demons, yea, we are <12538 <1863
by the <12368 of him who hath <94 to <560 our souls. <24 our
<2213 are great. O <596 <4096 thou not turn away <2224 <334 from
us? And this <194 be your language in <1394 days.

13:38 But <143 your days of probation are past; ye have
procrastinated the day of your salvation <3931 it is everlastingly too
late, and your <286 is made <286 yea, for ye have <70 all
the days of your lives for that <662 ye <3621 not obtain; and ye have
<19 for <2943 in <2953 <2258 <15 <6292 is <5493 to the
nature of that <9840 <11 is in our <869 and Eternal Head.

13:39 O ye <1003 of the <847 that ye <270 hear my words! And I pray
that the <117 of the Lord be <10743 away from you, and that ye <22
<1546 and be <2218

<2139 <2139 14

14:1 And now it came to pass that <1933 the <1933 did <2018 a
<68 many more <214 <76 <209 be written.

14:2 And <154 he said unto <1960 <191 I give unto you a sign; for
five <1727 more <1456 and <19 then <499 the Son of God to
<1198 all <191 who <198 <7494 on his name.

14:3 And <23 this will I give unto you for a sign at the time of
his coming; for <18 <758 <30 be <77 lights in <7797 <3490
that in the night <1187 he <55 <16 <16 be no <5823 <14
that it <8 appear unto man as if it was day.

14:4 <1877 <23 <15 be one day and a <34 and a day, as if it
were one day and <19 were no night; and this <24 be unto you for a
<121 for ye <10 know of the rising of the sun and also of its
setting; <2149 they <16 know of a <7678 that <38 <7 be two
days and a <43 nevertheless the <61 <11 not be darkened; and it
<7 be the <11 <106 he is born.

14:5 And <129 <33 <15 a new star arise, such an one as ye never
have beheld; and this also <17 be a sign unto you.

14:6 And <450 this is not all, <34 <17 be many signs and wonders
in <11231

14:7 And it <15 come to pass that ye <6 all be amazed, and wonder,
<171 that ye <10 fall to the <3017

14:8 And it <11 come to pass that <11491 <6 <241 on the Son
of God, the same <10 have <2469 <6696

14:9 And <103 thus hath the Lord <7809 me, by his angel, that I
<633 come and tell this <405 unto you; yea, he hath <19 that I
<15 <337 <2634 <333 unto you; yea, he hath said unto me: Cry
unto this <888 <378 and prepare the way of the <1426

14:10 And now, <612 I am a <373 and have <4963 unto you the
<951 <373 the Lord hath <52 me, and <20 it was hard <874
you, ye are <1144 with me and do seek to <576 me, and have cast me
out from <1048 you.

14:11 And ye <121 hear my <4753 for, for this intent have I come up
upon the <13130 of this <1492 that ye <2219 hear and know of the
<7783 of God <71 do <6966 you <68 of your <1209 and
also that ye <23 know the conditions of repentance;

14:12 And also that ye <14 know of the <8358 of <2327 <2327 the
Son of God, the Father of <1943 and of <2974 the Creator of all
<164 from the beginning; and that ye <32 know of the <270 of his
<8615 to the <94 that ye <14 <235 on his <476

14:13 And if ye <11 on his name ye will <189 of all your <9796
that thereby ye may have a remission of them <8986 his merits.

14:14 And <257 <2586 <5589 sign I give unto you, yea, a sign of
his death.

14:15 For <20 he <2215 must die that <714 may come; yea, it
behooveth him and becometh <4203 that he dieth, to <2406 to pass
the resurrection of the <7468 that <67 men may be <2892 into the
<2835 of the <267

14:16 Yea, <48 this <3590 bringeth to pass the resurrection, and
redeemeth all mankind from the <3932 death—that spiritual death; for
all mankind, by the fall of Adam <4428 cut off from the <42 of the
<833 are considered as <60 both as to <175 temporal and to <4
spiritual.

14:17 But <57 the <81 of Christ <52 <41 yea,
even all <5 and <67 them back into the <42 of the <84

14:18 Yea, and it <16 to pass the condition of repentance, that
<440 <2289 the same is not hewn down and cast into the fire;
but <15 <15 not is hewn down and cast into the <13 and
<516 <665 upon them <2008 a <112 death, yea, a <4032 <4
for they are cut off <14 as to <95 <4874 to <4874

14:19 <6017 <244 ye, <2 ye, lest by knowing <455 <17 and
not <880 them ye <381 <1320 <1320 to come <3806 condemnation,
and ye are <192 down unto this <50 <238

14:20 But <133 as I said unto you <4702 <263 <7211 a sign of
his <70 <15 in that day that he <43 <43 <211 the sun <5
be darkened and refuse to give his light unto you; and also the moon
and the stars; and <114 <22 be no <16 upon the face of this <932
even from the time that he <17 <44 <53 for the <4572 of <13425
<2959 to the time that he <15 rise <131 from the dead.

14:21 Yea, at the time that he <16 <5655 up the ghost <54 <6 be
thunderings and lightnings for the <40 of many hours, and the <2192
<16 shake and tremble; and the rocks <497 are upon the face of this
<459 <9 are both <12511 the <23 and beneath, <8 ye know at
this time are solid, or the more part of it is one solid mass, <43 be
<3666 up;

14:22 Yea, they <11 be rent in <6446 and <6 ever <1658 be <12426
in seams and in cracks, and in <27 fragments upon the face of the
<3676 <67 yea, both <66 the <66 and beneath.

14:23 And <198 <113 <37 be <960 tempests, and <6 <6 be
many <3745 laid low, like unto a valley, and <13 <13 be many
places <97 are now <9195 valleys <5 <11 <1275 <4797 <8656
height is <1240

14:24 And many highways <15 be <71 up, and many <2436 <7
<23 desolate.

14:25 And many graves <11 be opened, and <4 <186 up many of <2189
dead; and many saints <11 <1014 unto many.

14:26 And <89 thus hath the <2942 <756 unto me; for he said unto
me that <84 <805 be <215 and <215 for the <215 of
many hours.

14:27 And he said unto me that <3289 the thunder and the lightning
lasted, and the tempest, that <382 <382 <36 be, and that <1682
<6 <5234 the face of the <167 <162 for the <45 of <300 <1340

14:28 And the <74 said unto me that many <93 see <7333 <36
than these, to the <697 that they <697 <686 that <49 <711 and
<4 <983 <47 come to pass upon all the face of this <360 to
the <26 that <106 <17 be no <2163 for unbelief <841 the
<4011 of men—

14:29 And this to the <23 that <526 will <49 <51 be
<3599 and that <9 will not believe, a <2515 judgment <13
come upon <1598 and also if they are <10196 they <691 upon
<5017 <191 own condemnation.

14:30 And now remember, <1 my <9783 that <37
perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and <7 doeth <1405 <2
it unto <9 for <206 ye are free; ye are permitted to act for
yourselves; for <13 God hath <5467 unto you a <7196 and he hath
made you free.

14:31 He hath <18 unto you that ye <85 know good from <4297 and he
hath <14 unto you that ye <14 <1887 life or <737 and ye can do
good and be <3659 unto that <333 is <4310 or have that <6 is
good <13 unto you; or ye can do <43 and have that <15 is evil
<15 unto you.

<1449 <1449 15

15:1 And now, my beloved <129 <99 I <3230 unto you that
<3076 ye <243 <665 your houses <4 be left unto you <368

15:2 Yea, <17 ye <2952 your <4800 <16 have <434 <225 to <8591
in the day that they <12 give suck; for ye <5 attempt to flee and
<249 <7 be no <8434 for refuge; yea, and wo unto them <86 are
with child, for they <18 be <3388 and <1510 flee; <3853 they
<9 be trodden down and <5 be left to perish.

15:3 Yea, wo unto this <1596 who are <479 the <5 of <5432 <82
they <24 <84 when they <4 see all <331 <335 and <333
<57 <9 be <7977 unto <280 for <128 they have been a <8350
<32 of the <1999 yea, the <6 of <38 hath he loved, and also
hath he chastened <27 yea, in the days of <301 <1770 hath he
<12 them <1154 he loveth <1811

15:4 But <1383 my <178 the <3745 hath he hated <17 <25
<2333 have been evil continually, and this <10 of the <2482 of
the <14061 of <18 <14061 But <77 <1058 hath come unto
them <1098 the <13387 of the <12454 and for this <397 hath
the Lord prolonged <25 <475

15:5 And I <1705 that ye <434 <64 that the more part of them are
in the path of <25 duty, and they do walk circumspectly <1506 God,
and they do <3829 to keep his <3828 and his <12332 and his
<1271 <3832 to the law of <3832

15:6 Yea, I say unto you, that the more part of them are <944 <2375
and they are striving with unwearied diligence that they may <458 the
<10251 of <65 <3467 to the <413 of the truth; <1603
<275 are many who do add to <17 <5220 daily.

15:7 And <137 ye do know of <10178 for ye have witnessed it,
that as many of them as are <992 to the <43 of the <9546 and
to know of the <2364 and abominable traditions of <45 <9712 and
are led to <558 the holy scriptures, yea, the <13562 of the holy
<2198 <277 are written, <3 leadeth them to <3695 on the <1181
and unto <1130 <12 <9 and <3708 <1141 a change of
<2509 unto them—

15:8 <1757 as many as have come to <136 ye know of <1080 are
firm and steadfast in the <8676 and in the <1569 wherewith they have
been made <544

15:9 And ye know also that they have <4411 <93 <14344 of war, and
they fear to take them up lest by any <13051 they <251 sin; yea, ye
can see that they fear to sin—for <262 they will <1058 <648
that they be <428 down and <2759 by <43 <3597 and will not lift
<7 <2245 <1576 <2322 and this <335 of <8 <117 in Christ.

15:10 And now, <12 of <12 steadfastness when they do <161 in
that <99 <139 they do <717 for <17 of <17 <14329 when
they are once enlightened, <225 the Lord <448 <5145 them and
prolong <17 <1123 <4816 <3 iniquity—

15:11 Yea, even if they <100 <12682 in <783 the Lord <25
<22 <19 <22 <2165 the time <8 come <53 hath been <921 of
by our <233 and also by the <2832 Zenos, and many <9506 <226
<1239 the restoration of our <453 the <5843 <1171 to the
<273 of the truth—

15:12 Yea, I say unto you, that in the latter times the promises of the
Lord have been extended to our <36 the <5501 and
<93 the many afflictions <70 they <74 have, and
<10 they <6 be <5670 to and fro upon the face of the
<1115 and be hunted, and <17 be <6850 and <7460 abroad, <6016
no <653 for refuge, the Lord <14 be <11344 unto <549

15:13 And this is <449 to the prophecy, that they <18 <100 be
<375 to the true knowledge, <66 is <106 of <147 Redeemer,
and <4 <719 and true shepherd, and be numbered <947 his sheep.

15:14 <1422 I say unto you, it <38 be <11444 for them than for
you <673 ye <7502

15:15 For <220 had the <7838 <7962 been <7998 unto them <55 have
been <7 unto you, yea, unto them who have dwindled in <218
<255 of the <438 of <68 <205 ye can see of <383
that they <2053 <593 <96 have <23 in unbelief.

15:16 <409 <2666 the <4042 I will not <11453 <1886 <322 but I
will <820 that in the day of my wisdom they <91 <3903 <34 unto
me, <28 the <1601

15:17 And now <89 <10 the <471 <255 the <741 of the
Nephites: If they will not <781 and <628 to do my <3556 I will
<56 <56 <56 <27 the <27 <95 of <92 <100
<231 the many <125 <125 <121 I have done <164 <769 and
as <1782 as the Lord liveth <70 <816 <1164 be, <31 the <68

<953 <953 16

16:1 And now, it came to pass that <628 were many who <9481 the <2025
of <2411 the <2038 <50 he <11227 upon the <1980 of the city. And
as many as <8363 on his word went <4401 and <2517 for <8379 and
when they had come <11 and <1437 him they confessed unto him <96
sins and denied not, desiring that they <1073 be baptized unto the
<83

16:2 But as many as <74 were who did not <487 in the <76 of
Samuel were <2089 with him; and they cast <3347 at him upon the wall,
and also many shot arrows at him as he stood upon the wall; but the
<4240 of the Lord was with him, <2252 that they <2617 not hit him
with <82 <40 <15042 with <4 arrows.

16:3 Now when they saw that they <22 not hit him, <78 were many
more who did <80 on his <2137 <40 that they went away unto
<982 to be baptized.

16:4 For <258 <10 was baptizing, and prophesying, and preaching,
crying <728 unto the <2238 showing <1032 and wonders, working
miracles <234 the <10 that they <146 know that the <1913 must
shortly come—

16:5 Telling them of <243 <210 must <12 <10613 that they <23
know and <3599 at the time of <101 <2154 that they had been made
<9389 unto them beforehand, to the <985 that they <26 believe;
<887 as many as <235 on the <182 of <181 went <226 unto
him to be baptized, for they came repenting and confessing <44 sins.

16:6 But the more part of them did not <136 in the <34 of Samuel;
<45 when they saw that they <160 not hit him with <32 <181
and <4 arrows, they <4686 unto <5 captains, <7251 Take this
fellow and bind him, for <787 he hath a devil; and <387 of the
<5385 of the <12340 <125 is in him we <1232 hit him with our <43
and our arrows; <60 take him and bind him, and away with him.

16:7 And as they went <112 to lay <61 <5840 on him, <208 he did
cast <8772 down from the <298 and did flee out of <19 <6252 yea,
even unto his own <13980 and <4889 to <4889 and to <2478 <218
his own <4641

16:8 And <41 he was <559 <428 of more <17 the <1175 and
thus were the affairs of the <24

16:9 And thus <6032 the <4995 and <4995 year of the <5657 of the
<6386 over the <541 of <6386

16:10 And thus <24 also the <25 and <6826 year of the <25 of
the <11832 the more part of the <28 remaining in <97 <3551 and
<5028 and the lesser part walking more <1207 <1207 God.

16:11 And <541 were the <2452 <4701 in the <45 and <6856 year
of the <46 of the <6209

16:12 And <389 was but little alteration in the <105 of the <349
save it were the <61 <146 to be more <3501 in <1638 and do
more and more of that <226 was <3050 to the <1264 of God, in
the <59 and <6883 year of the <58 of the <58

16:13 But it came to pass in the ninetieth year of the <19 of the
<123 <73 were <821 <423 <1637 unto the <70 and wonders; and
the <329 of the <11093 <73 to be <7615

16:14 And <3218 did <1923 unto men, wise men, and did <1602 unto
them glad <4850 of <40 joy; thus in this year the scriptures <33
to be <34

16:15 <9752 the <118 <12 to <4578 <180 <6090 all save
it were the most believing part of <743 both of the <5230 and also
of the <1024 and <27 to depend upon <28 own strength and upon
<6 own wisdom, <392

16:16 Some <501 they may have guessed right, <293 so <6612 but
<305 we know that all <220 <83 and <10630 <781 <391 come to
<4419 of <176 has been spoken.

16:17 And they <56 to reason and to <9860 <37 <10686 <51

16:18 That it is not reasonable that such a <2517 as a <574 <808
<2591 if so, and he be the Son of God, the <2703 of <2703 and of
<1063 as it has been spoken, why will he not show <422 unto us as
well as unto them who <40 be at <11154

16:19 Yea, why will he not show <24 in this land as well as in the
land of <23

16:20 But <123 we know that this is a <1444 tradition, <116 has
been handed down unto us by our <1012 to <980 us that we <1247
<588 in some <147 and <147 <1293 <25 <10 come to <147
but not <133 us, but in a land <14 is far distant, a land <6 we
know not; <553 they can keep us in ignorance, for we <181
<9780 with our own eyes that they are <10766

16:21 And they <999 by the cunning and the mysterious arts of the evil
one, work some <70 mystery <48 we <36 understand, <4 will
keep us down to be <10654 to <259 <811 and also <6 unto
<288 for we <277 upon them to teach us the word; and thus will they
keep us in ignorance if we will <2294 ourselves unto <26 all the days
of our lives.

16:22 And many more <298 did the <348 imagine up in <55 <348
<68 were <3942 and vain; and they were much disturbed, for <14822
did stir them up to do <1808 continually; yea, he did go <3637
spreading rumors and <7381 upon all the face of the <2225 that he
<817 <394 the <4426 of the <54 <1509 that <50 was good and
<7 that <7 <197 <11304

16:23 And <1138 the <480 and the <1936 <14 were wrought
<207 the <30 of the <1159 and the many <915 <14 they did,
<78 did get <166 hold upon the <52 of the <22 upon all the
face of the <3774

16:24 And thus <667 the <541 year of the <541 of the <688 over
the <28 of <689

16:25 And thus <22 the book of <13837 <1400 to the <11861 of
<1191 and his sons.




 THIRD BOOK OF NEPHI

THE SON OF NEPHI, WHO WAS THE SON OF HELAMAN

And <35 was the son of <47 who was the son of <16471 who was
the son of <7 <451 a descendant of <1055 who was the son of <7521
who came out of <11555 in the <3000 year of the <104 of Zedekiah,
the king of Judah.

3 <31 <1280 1

1:1 Now it came to pass that the ninety and <32 year had <15400 away
and it was six <5387 <3660 from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem;
and it was in the year that Lachoneus was the <8346 <10751 and the
governor over the <183

1:2 And <7348 the son of <113 had departed out of the land of
<5818 giving charge unto his son <19 who was his eldest son,
<1427 the plates of brass, and all the <14851 <246 had been
kept, and all <3720 <349 <9 had been kept sacred from the
departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem.

1:3 Then he <58 out of the <327 and whither he <11323 no man
knoweth; and his son <140 did keep the <50 in his <15460 yea, the
<243 of this <974

1:4 And it came to pass that in the <7337 of the <156 and
<3021 <5977 <585 the <2006 of the <816 <688 to be
fulfilled more fully; for <841 <9 to be <2646 <363 and <3
<350 <362 <361 the <48

1:5 But <19 were some who <22 to say that the time was past for the
<862 to be fulfilled, <123 were <1842 by <1488 the Lamanite.

1:6 And they <28 to <8072 over <483 <1800 <745 <4696 the
time is past, and the <32 of <1257 are not fulfilled; <2405
your joy and your <1957 <182 this <647 hath been vain.

1:7 And it came to pass that they did make a <432 uproar <7944
the <7911 and the <405 who <1303 <59 to be very sorrowful, lest
by any <2042 <207 <207 <84 had been <85 <510 not come to <9380

1:8 But <150 they did watch steadfastly for that day and that <3804
and that day <29 <519 be as one day as if <140 were no night, that
they <40 know that <114 <92 had not been <90

1:9 Now it came to pass that <26 was a day set apart by the
unbelievers, that all <77 who <90 in <4 <1797 <51 be
put to <3215 <1840 the sign <9 come to <776 <65 had been <1056
by <154 the <4697

1:10 Now it came to pass that when <346 the son of <4 saw this
<5384 of his <1081 his <2237 was <7089 sorrowful.

1:11 And it came to pass that he went out and <13945 <885 down upon
the <925 and <1410 mightily to his God in behalf of his <37 yea,
<86 who were <690 to be <9012 <1410 of <127 <127 in the
<2511 of <7 <2511

1:12 And it came to pass that he <41 <41 unto the <665 all that
day; and <190 the <6213 of the Lord came unto him, <278

1:13 Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for <24 the time is at
<14685 and on this <214 <992 the sign be given, and on the <4509 come
I into the <6062 to show unto the <15423 that I will fulfill all that
<172 I have <5152 to be <269 by the <13948 of my holy <8163

1:14 <4238 I come unto my own, to <29 all <294 <28 I have
made <1631 unto the <3021 of men from the <16868 of the <57
and to do the <952 both of the <1100 and of the Son—of the <6
<156 of me, and of the Son <7 of my flesh. And <112 the time
is at <112 and this <111 <111 the sign be given.

1:15 And it came to pass that the <422 <73 came unto <541 were
<458 <780 as they had been spoken; for <41 at the going
down of the sun <327 was no <13173 and the <411 <409 to be
<11293 <67 <13 was no <3200 when the <60 came.

1:16 And <13 were <5908 who had not <345 the <58 of the
<2337 who fell to the <3218 and <8060 as if they were <3741 for
they knew that the <470 plan of <4538 <84 they had laid for
<292 who <37 in the <38 of the <596 had been frustrated;
for the sign <22 had been <379 was <4859 at hand.

1:17 And they <90 to know that the Son of God must <1849 appear;
yea, in <7512 all the <108 upon the face of the <3296 <78 from the
west to the east, both in the land <16323 and in the land south, were so
<403 <132 that they fell to the <4238

1:18 For they knew that the <84 had <10997 of <1392 <261 for
many <8208 and that the sign <90 had been <90 was <90 at hand;
and they <87 to fear <175 of <398 <1108 and <3 <2282

1:19 And it came to pass that <178 was no <191 in all that <561
but it was as <3708 as though it was mid-day. And it came to pass that
the sun did rise in the morning <4036 <254 to its proper order;
and they knew that it was the day that the Lord <555 be born, <71
of the sign <90 had been <302

1:20 And it had come to <573 yea, all <12411 <7717 whit, <44 to
the <214 of the <400

1:21 And it came to pass also that a new star did appear, <24 to
the word.

1:22 And it came to pass that from this time <1911 <121 <142 to be
lyings sent <8 <834 the <563 by Satan, to <1234 <148 <1280
to the <2061 that they <694 not <1434 in <285 <860 and <1222
<94 they had seen; but <1234 <200 <34 and deceivings
the more part of the <259 did <2742 and were <10669 unto the
<2284

1:23 And it came to pass that <413 went <63 <63 the <63 and
also many others, baptizing unto <2916 in the <52 <85 was a
<357 <4226 of <2102 And thus the <48 <96 <2482 to have <8727
in the <1077

1:24 And <26 were no <9840 save it were a few that <24 to
<6878 endeavoring to <10802 by the <1759 that it was no more
<4226 to <2493 the law of <3108 Now in this <903 they did err,
<2693 not understood the scriptures.

1:25 But it came to pass that they soon <449 converted, and were
<17297 of the error <94 they were in, for it was made <602 unto
them that the law was not yet <538 and that it must be <1043
in <250 whit; yea, the word came unto them that it must be <983
yea, that one jot or tittle <295 not pass away till it <6 all be
<18 <1613 in this same year were they <2754 to a <2750
of <234 <73 and did <11055 <5 faults.

1:26 And thus the <1119 and <1118 year did pass away, <16079 glad
<1911 unto the <180 <344 of the <252 <103 did come to <334
<306 to the <329 of the prophecy of all the holy <334

1:27 And it came to pass that the <47 and <8251 year did also pass
away in <16743 save it were for the <9525 <8506 who dwelt upon
the <3953 who did infest the <1071 for so <8273 were <89 holds
and <4 <8695 <3978 that the <76 <2337 not overpower <2681
<122 they did <8791 many <5979 and did do much slaughter <298
the <1196

1:28 And it came to pass that in the <75 and <6692 year they <269
to <8180 in <306 degree, <120 <287 were many <8789 of the
<2002 who did flee unto <1697 <130 did <1828 much <14754 unto <390
<14 who did <7245 in the <320

1:29 And <33 was also a <22 of much <23 <70 the <3020 for
<778 they had many <861 who did grow up and <64 to wax <116
in <617 that they <294 for <1991 and were led away by some
who were Zoramites, by <130 <439 and <3 <5744 <1801 to join
<69 <161 robbers.

1:30 And thus were the <3565 afflicted <2269 and <47 to decrease
as to <27 <1048 and <15971 <114 of the <1107 of the
<5053 generation.

3 <456 <1550 2

2:1 And it came to pass that thus <1545 away the <156 and <8410 year
<47 and the <197 <49 to <8251 <67 <274 and <526 <146 they
had heard, and <13 to be less and less <751 at a sign or a
wonder from <5185 <2708 that they <19 to be hard in <80
<573 and <5790 in <6 minds, and <14 to disbelieve all <43
they had <2464 and seen—

2:2 Imagining up some vain <468 in <24 <29 that it was <1449
by men and by the <2578 of the <6032 to lead away and deceive the
<1806 of the <7228 and thus did <1820 get possession of the <12
of the <107 <745 <79 that he did <71 <46 eyes and lead
them away to <646 that the <9282 of <2185 was a <1939 and a
vain thing.

2:3 And it came to pass that the <40 <101 to wax <243 in
<189 and abominations; and they did not <39 that <281 <482
be any more <164 or <164 given; and <76 did go <6755 leading
away the <79 of the <661 tempting them and causing them that they
<30 do <350 <43 in the <324

2:4 And thus did pass away the <219 and <2597 <10367 and also the
<8 and <2580 <8 and also the <7 and <2542 <7 and also
the <8 and <2491 <8

2:5 And also an <1794 <1794 had <259 away <13564 the days of Mosiah,
who was king over the <114 of the Nephites.

2:6 And six <26 and nine <28 had <28 away <28 Lehi left
<1740

2:7 And nine <15 had <15 away from the time when the sign was
<1322 <251 was <1296 of by the <1144 that <183 <117 come
into the <16585

2:8 Now the <453 <176 to reckon <213 time from this period when
the sign was <36 or from the <2944 of Christ; <1658 nine <57
had <58 away.

2:9 And <1502 who was the <13515 of <6 who had the <1866 of the
records, did not <3307 to the land of <1880 and <576 nowhere be
<3181 in all the <188

2:10 And it came to pass that the <139 did <7775 <530 in
<2744 <919 the much <3992 and <17933 <111
was sent <527 <611 and thus <72 away the tenth year also; and the
eleventh year also <12 away in <6146

2:11 And it came to pass in the thirteenth year <287 <127 to be wars
and <2238 <1743 all the <672 for the <526 <9118 had
<4615 so numerous, and did slay so many of the <293 and did lay
<9785 so many cities, and did <9719 so much <1670 and carnage
<38 the <1945 that it <587 <914 that all the <28 both
the <187 and the <2653 <203 take up arms <2274 <3597

2:12 <3482 all the <579 who had <62 <1027 unto the
Lord did <17141 with <212 <1870 the <7114 and were compelled,
for the safety of <12 <5889 and <3 <4323 and <3 children, to
take up arms <46 <561 <102 <789 yea, and also to maintain
<17 rights, and the privileges of <6 <9814 and of <4 worship,
and <4 freedom and <3 liberty.

2:13 And it came to pass that <2933 this <157 year had <175
away the <102 were threatened with <7488 <1431 <656 of
this war, <210 had <95 <1358 sore.

2:14 And it came to pass that <73 <112 who had <15016 with the
<34 were <3688 <232 the <3055

2:15 And <66 <6139 was <6176 from <801 and <7 skin <165 white
like unto the <21

2:16 And <14 young men and <4 daughters <18 <59 fair,
and they were <43 <43 the <152 and were <4392 <434
And thus <2377 the <99 <9120

2:17 And it came to pass in the <2125 of the fourteenth <2122
the war between the <262 and the <330 of <757 did <10729 and
did <113 <54 sore; <12225 the <13 of <13 did gain
some advantage of the <186 <645 that they did drive them back
out of <82 <15055 into the <4959 and into <7 <973 places.

2:18 And thus <78 the <62 <78 And in the fifteenth year they
did come <1272 <230 the <53 of <3604 and <182 of the
<607 of the <11 of <447 and <40 many <356 and
dissensions, the <252 <92 did gain many advantages over <306

2:19 And thus <52 the <47 <114 and thus were the <33 in a
<8279 of many afflictions; and the <7763 of <235 did hang over
<195 <104 that they were <1958 to be <3959 down by it, and this
<72 of <63 <439

3 <135 <905 3

3:1 And now it came to pass that in the sixteenth year from the <559
of <5657 Lachoneus, the <2430 of the <411 <13918 an epistle
from the leader and the <13 of this band of <9829 and <1437
were the <1189 <308 were <4329 <1985

3:2 <35 most noble and <2472 <25 of the <38 <1053 I
write this <41 unto you, and do give unto you <222 <766
praise <93 of your firmness, and also the <4208 of your <469
in maintaining that <49 ye <6752 to be your right and liberty; yea,
ye do <12504 <6796 as if ye were supported by the hand of a god, in the
defence of your <12220 and your property, and your <3449 or that
<42 ye do call so.

3:3 And it seemeth a pity unto me, most <98 <101 that ye <529
be so <917 and vain as to <70 that ye can <63 <263 so many
brave men who are at my command, who do now at this time <18 in <202
arms, and do <5867 with <121 anxiety for the word—Go down upon the
<446 and <3988 <270

3:4 And I, <5549 of <28 unconquerable <14569 <1504 proved them in
the field of battle, and <15 of <15 <6058 <18781 <9148
you <160 of the many wrongs <108 ye have done unto <278 <1327
if they <97 come down <86 you they <4114 <7998 you with <534
<8000

3:5 <4189 I have written this epistle, sealing it with mine own
<2087 feeling for your welfare, <49 of your <205 in that <50
ye <1022 to be <3300 and your <150 spirit in the <80 of <6699

3:6 <43 I <251 unto you, <3990 that ye <62 <3048 up unto
this my <240 your <731 your <3657 and your possessions, <6962
than that they <88 <82 you with the <383 and that <384
<10 come upon you.

3:7 Or in <4422 <1316 <41 <4224 up unto us, and <719 with us
and <523 acquainted with our <493 <8772 and <7 our <4748
that ye may be like unto us—not our slaves, but our <13 and
partners of all our substance.

3:8 And <348 I swear unto you, if ye will do <4665 with an oath, ye
<2225 not be destroyed; but if ye will not do <16 I <25 unto you
with an <21 that on the <2350 month I will <9294 that my <9977
<31 come down <202 you, and they <7 not stay <233 hand and
<7 <10914 not, but <4 slay you, and <4 let fall the <135 upon
you even <4569 ye <11 <108 extinct.

3:9 And <87 I am Giddianhi; and I am the <447 of this the
<131 society of <10292 <220 <4 and the <3503 thereof I know
to be good; and they are of ancient date and they have been <3394 down
unto us.

3:10 And I <231 this <482 unto you, <398 and I hope that ye
will deliver up your <684 and your <230 without the shedding
of blood, that this my <622 may recover <113 rights and <16807
who have dissented away from you <302 of your <675 in
retaining from them <20 <20 of <20 and <2667 ye do <172
I will avenge <13 wrongs. I am Giddianhi.

3:11 And now it came to pass when <3046 <605 this <82 he
was <560 astonished, <47 of the boldness of Giddianhi
demanding the <1432 of the land of the <844 and also of
threatening the <83 and avenging the <420 of <913 that had
<40 no wrong, save it were they had wronged <4855 by
dissenting away unto <19 <3549 and <4993 <1635

3:12 Now <197 this <144 the governor, was a just man, and
<1211 not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a
robber; <469 he did not <7894 to the <95 of Giddianhi, the
<226 of the <867 but he did <1738 that his <82 <390 cry
unto the Lord for <3767 <291 the time that the <822 <14
come down <10 <552

3:13 Yea, he sent a <14052 <965 all the <445 that they <21
<14167 <13978 <169 women, and <3 <1113 <2 <10004 and <3
<10004 and all <5 substance, save it were <5 <739 unto one
place.

3:14 And he <2692 that fortifications <37 be built <8283 <842
<571 and the <74 <305 <11 be <192 <5878 And he
<21 that armies, both of the <632 and of the <1215 or of
all them who were <1045 <80 the <201 <29 be placed as
guards <43 <43 to <2996 <44 and to guard them from the <116
day and night.

3:15 Yea, he said unto <6989 As the Lord <7788 <285 ye <5563 of
all your <6563 and cry unto the <2853 ye will in no wise be
<16473 out of the <4256 of <231 <984 <229

3:16 And so <727 and <3765 were the <885 and <3215 of
<306 that they did <200 fear to come upon all the <1737 and
they did exert <273 in <154 <2366 to do <2105 to the <31
of Lachoneus.

3:17 And it came to pass that <40 did appoint <920 captains over
all the <529 of the <133 to <537 them at the time that the
<125 <143 come down out of the <10589 <244 <244

3:18 Now the chiefest <162 all the <39 <39 and the <96
commander of the <42 of the <190 was appointed, and his name was
Gidgiddoni.

3:19 Now it was the custom <33 all the <21 to <75 for <100
<39 <4460 (save it were in <8 <5090 of wickedness) some one
that had the <767 of revelation and also prophecy; <1619 this
Gidgiddoni was a <63 <5148 <39 <222 as also was the <36 <13055

3:20 Now the <358 said unto Gidgiddoni: Pray unto the <205 and let
us go up upon the <1233 and into the <10579 that we may fall
upon the <131 and <921 them in <71 own <10795

3:21 But <60 <4888 unto <259 The Lord forbid; for if we <153
go up <150 them the Lord <836 <599 us into <30 hands;
<446 we will <6938 <3893 in the center of our <842 and we
will <401 all our <158 <16931 and we will not go <36 <105
but we will wait till they <710 come <11 us; <38 as the Lord
<320 if we do this he will <56 them into our hands.

3:22 And it came to pass in the seventeenth <1283 in the <5264 end of
the <8 the <472 of <270 had gone <1340 <1638 all
the face of the <455 and they had <1485 <98 horses, and <3
chariots, and <4 cattle, and all <4 flocks, and <3 <484 and
<4 grain, and all <4 <488 and did march <40 by <12113
and by tens of thousands, <809 they had all gone <14 to the <5277
<792 had been <19089 that they <162 <133 <363 <131
to defend <5 <119 <39 <16735

3:23 And the land <24 was <23 was the land of <1845 and
the land <12 was <1505 the land <17735 and the land Bountiful,
yea, to the line <15 was <15 the land Bountiful and the land
Desolation.

3:24 And <1809 were a <293 many <15605 <280 who were <1571
<398 who did <74 <69 <609 in this <1890 Now
<151 did <459 that they <88 <14 <14 <14 in the
land <11568 <772 of the <36 <1641 <57 was upon the land
<17803

3:25 And they did fortify <27 <110 <110 <8652 and they
did dwell in one <185 and in one body, and they did fear the <490
<38 had been <2037 by <761 <1486 that they did <571 of
all <35 sins; and they did put up <7 prayers unto the Lord <5
God, that he <325 <269 them in the time that <12 <10665 <92
come down <66 them to <1190

3:26 And they were <680 sorrowful <100 of <21 <190 And
<375 did <120 that they <28 make <5731 of war of <2756
<19423 and they <11 be <2268 with armor, and with shields, and with
bucklers, <6665 the <8407 of his instruction.

3 <1559 <1559 4

4:1 And it came to pass that in the <333 end of the eighteenth year
<660 <393 of <451 had prepared for <1353 and <2019 to come down
and to sally <291 from the hills, and out of the <2702 and the
<485 and <95 strongholds, and <3 <1100 <11455 and <29
to take <971 of the <445 both <170 were in the land <19692 and
<8 were in the land <19671 and <24 to take <23 of all the
<1082 <16 had been deserted by the <268 and the <6691 <10 had
been left <6325

4:2 But <973 <295 were no wild beasts nor game in <101 <32 <22
had been <33 by the <33 and <19 was no game for the
<116 save it were in the <11256

4:3 And the <13 <1003 not exist save it were in the <112 for
the want of food; for the <676 had left <119 <52 desolate, and
had <14933 <7 <949 and <3 herds and all <4 <460 and
they were in one body.

4:4 <2117 <69 was no chance for the <55 to plunder and to
<18292 food, save it were to come up in open battle <283 the
<1996 and the <60 <4282 in one <345 and <1570 so <381 a
number, and <7 reserved for <372 provisions, and horses and
<539 and <73 of <285 <284 that they <861 subsist for the <6751
of seven <2798 in the <148 time they did hope to <703 the <72
from off the face of the <2267 and thus the <274 year did pass
<2387

4:5 And it came to pass that in the nineteenth year <1224 <2369
that it was <2256 that he <344 go up to <101 <101 the
<198 for <129 was no way that they <183 <76 save it were to
<134 and rob and <14127

4:6 And they <16835 not <2308 <111 upon the face of the land
<462 that they <32 <14830 <646 lest the <143 <54 come
upon them and slay <2404 <734 <72 gave commandment unto his
<368 that in this year they <21 go up to <75 <75 the
<2146

4:7 And it came to pass that they did come up to battle; and it was in
the <2654 month; and <317 <192 and terrible was the day that they
did come up to <24 and they were girded <1142 <461 the <461 of
<1971 and they had a lamb-skin <12 <274 loins, and they were dyed
in <1452 and <10 heads were shorn, and they had head-plates upon
<100 and <53 and <53 was the appearance of the <102 of
<1321 <541 of <26 <518 and <5 of <5 <272 dyed in
<15582

4:8 And it came to pass that the <28 of the <194 when they saw
the <40 of the army of <39 had all <15457 to the <4093
and did lift <42 cries to the Lord <5 God, that he <625 <1638
them and <629 them out of the <1205 of <16 <609

4:9 And it came to pass that when the <60 of <198 saw this they
<504 to shout with a loud <10236 <93 of <30 joy, for they had
supposed that the <231 had <70 with fear <16 of the terror
of <20 armies.

4:10 But in this <2999 they were disappointed, for the <26 did not
fear <154 but they did fear <25 God and did supplicate him for
protection; <1127 when the <73 of <73 did rush upon them
they were <637 to meet <30 yea, in the <1401 of the Lord they
did <8985 <1227

4:11 And the <285 <12118 in this the <263 <263 and <209 and
<210 was the <14 <10355 yea, <9 and <8 was the
<3329 <9 <344 that <381 <5563 was <3518 so <15 a
<12 <1190 all the <899 of Lehi <2889 he left <2888

4:12 And <2769 the <1578 and the <19525 <470 <88
had made, <317 the <118 did beat <1115 <43 that they did
fall back from <2598 <84

4:13 And it came to pass that <812 <8069 that his <124
<383 pursue them as far as the borders of the <627 and that
they <15 not <241 any that <5 fall into <161 <239 by the way;
and thus they did <32 them and did slay <65 to the <34 of the
<35 even <1084 they had <3616 the <445 of
<1352

4:14 And it came to pass that <311 who had <6020 and fought with
boldness, was pursued as he fled; and <356 weary <252 of his much
fighting he was overtaken and <15649 And thus was the end of <136
the robber.

4:15 And it came to pass that the <117 of the <148 did <2966
<3792 to <101 <1154 of security. And it came to pass that this
<605 year did pass <3639 and the <642 did not come <25 to
<485 <6077 did they come <8 in the twentieth <2595

4:16 And in the twenty and <4947 year they did not come up to <928
but they came up on all sides to lay siege <1662 <508 the <247 of
<2616 for they did <2366 that if they <183 cut off the <15 of
<990 from <88 <926 and <12 hem them in on <742 side, and if
they <11 cut them off from all <20 outward privileges, that they
<648 <1055 them to <2211 <664 up <1621 to <15 wishes.

4:17 Now they had <1257 unto <15 <7887 leader, <7648 name
was Zemnarihah; <662 it was Zemnarihah that did <33 that this
<88 <51 take <1808

4:18 But <317 this was an <2758 to the <843 for it was
impossible for the <157 to lay <27 <19752 long to have any
effect upon the <569 <231 of <69 much provision <356 they
had laid up in store,

4:19 And <18 of the scantiness of provisions <396 the robbers—for
<57 they had <10661 save it were meat for <35 subsistence, <34
meat they did <923 in the wilderness;

4:20 And it came to pass that the wild game <2910 scarce in the
wilderness—insomuch that the <83 were <195 to <13515 with hunger.

4:21 And the <278 were continually marching out by day and by
<4288 and falling upon <59 <1910 and cutting them off by <1461
and by tens of thousands.

4:22 And thus it <56 the <11703 of the <229 of <169 to
<10627 from <33 design, <113 of the <510 <2432 <97 came
upon them by <4530 and by day.

4:23 And it came to pass that <32 did give <1818 unto his
<41 that they <203 <40 <224 from the siege, and <1534
into the furthermost <12310 of the land <1409

4:24 And now, <509 <423 aware of <64 <64 and <2612 of
<6 weakness <70 of the want of <1084 and the <75 <583
<76 had been made <192 <493 <266 he did send out his <423 in
the night-time, and did cut off the way of <37 retreat, and did <429
his <19 in the way of <12 retreat.

4:25 And this did they do in the <33 and got on <17 <93
<18132 the <2183 so that on the morrow, when the <209 <785 <15
march, they were met by the <45 of the <209 both in <14 front
and in <5 rear.

4:26 And the <29 who were on the <1332 were also cut off in <19
<4053 of <73 And all <2932 <4569 were done by <171 of
<592

4:27 And <720 were many <239 who did <417 <178 up
prisoners unto the <353 and the <7369 of them were <580

4:28 And <47 <420 Zemnarihah, was <1757 and hanged upon a tree,
yea, even upon the top <2204 <649 he was <8249 And when they had
<20 him <11 he was dead they did fell the tree to the <957 and
did cry with a loud <912 <3012

4:29 May the Lord <20536 his <260 in <9267 and in holiness
of <14904 that they may <477 to be felled to the <4727 all who <1892
seek to slay them <249 of <3905 and <1491 combinations, even as
this man hath been <25 to the <4724

4:30 And they did <5340 and cry <636 with one <68 <68 May the
God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, <20616
this <78 in <4075 so long as they <64 call on the name of
<150 God for protection.

4:31 And it came to pass that they did break <18210 all as one, in
singing, and praising <26 God for the <336 <1014 <335 he had done
for <336 in preserving them from <464 into the <851 of <22
<1091

4:32 Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to the Most High God. And they did cry:
<15046 be the name of the Lord God Almighty, the Most High God.

4:33 And <40 <3955 were <19406 with joy, unto the gushing out of
many tears, <167 of the <75 <12184 of God in <12461 them out
of the <70 of <30 <1849 and they knew it was <23 of <9
<6829 and <4 <13896 that they had been <2390 from an
<3069 <3038

3 <766 <1756 5

5:1 And now <643 <333 was not a living soul <462 all the <180 of
the <394 who did doubt in the <19612 the <1890 of all the holy
<4947 who had <5120 for they knew that it must needs be that they
must be <6422

5:2 And they knew that it must be <1503 that <3953 had <6881
<94 of the many <4102 <192 had been <3938 <812 to the <53
of the <10323 and <18 of the <429 <17 had come to pass
<4991 they knew that it must <59 be that all <17 <607 come to
pass <35 to that <25 had been <6406

5:3 <3122 they did forsake all <148 <9021 and <3 <20210
and <4 whoredoms, and did <13843 God with all <7830 day and
<2585

5:4 And now it came to pass that when they had <459 all the <524
prisoners, <1174 that none did escape who were not <16763 they did
cast <46 <499 into <14745 and did <418 the word of God to be
preached unto <1290 and as many as <1407 <2054 of <24 sins and <11634
into a covenant that they <13 <13393 no more were set at <3829

5:5 But as many as <225 were who did not <28 into a <20955 and
who did <4041 <3710 to have <1885 <461 <17360 in <47 <4383
yea, as many as were <1706 breathing out <1284 <1622 <13
<3183 were <8412 and punished <160 to the law.

5:6 And thus they did put an end to all <41 <22026 and secret, and
<2921 <507 in the <184 <69 was so much <4097 and
so many <59 committed.

5:7 And thus had the <1132 and <4804 year <3914 <1164 and the <8
and <4766 year <4534 and the <8 and fourth, and the <5 and
fifth; and thus had <7 and five <4203 <28 <1814

5:8 And <58 had many <255 transpired which, in the eyes of <18303
<155 be <418 and marvelous; <3833 they <6457 all be <3419
in this book; yea, this book <11 contain even a hundredth part of
what was done <387 so many <387 in the <1899 of <60 and five
<19886

5:9 But <7124 <60 are <6050 <122 do <34 all the proceedings
of this <2798 and a shorter but true account was <5335 by <6321

5:10 <322 I have made my <6073 of <793 <92 <182 to the
<8 of <3850 <40 was engraven on the <6152 <6 were <2400 the
<6 of <34

5:11 And <475 I do make the <27 on <15 <21 I have made with
mine own <2590

5:12 And <22 I am <36 Mormon, <983 <3 <1818 the land of
<8 the land in <30 Alma did establish the <4141 <125 the
<3066 yea, the <1341 <8 <14 was <19095 <11 them <28
<274 transgression.

5:13 <5724 I am a disciple of <9505 <3848 the Son of God. I have
been <53 of him to <6956 his word <33 his <43 that they
<2072 have <586 <9713

5:14 And it hath <3408 <524 that I, <135 to the will of God,
that the <2437 of <311 who have gone hence, who were the holy ones,
<504 be <1543 <25 to <77 <8164 <7 make a <136 of
<172 <172 <94 have been done—

5:15 Yea, a small <16 of that <14 hath <480 <1069 from the time
that Lehi left <20073 even down <927 the present <10928

5:16 <217 I do make my <30 from the accounts <31 have been
<237 by <77 who were <1678 me, <28 the <4166 of my day;

5:17 And then I do make a <31 of the <76 <31 I have seen with
mine own eyes.

5:18 And I know the <21 <18 I make to be a just and a true record;
<9988 <315 are many <35 <374 <124 to our language, we
are not able to write.

5:19 And now I make an end of my <16815 <42 is of <19218 and
proceed to give my <336 of the <39 <14 have been <99 me.

5:20 I am <273 and a pure <6598 of Lehi. I have <7075 to <8222
my God and my Savior <254 <254 that he <5314 our <11059 out of
the land of <167 (and no one knew it save it were <6144 and
<153 whom he <24 out of that land) and that he hath <167 me and
my <445 so much <5352 unto the <8642 of our <10465

5:21 Surely he hath <11277 the <16658 of <1037 and hath been <8151
unto the seed of Joseph.

5:22 And <716 as the <5187 of Lehi have kept his <7355 he
hath <33 them and prospered them <164 to his <5668

5:23 Yea, and <7981 <1071 he <1104 <8599 a remnant of the seed of
Joseph to the <77 of the Lord <315 God.

5:24 And as <27 as the Lord <3048 will he <2858 in from the four
quarters of the <1180 all the <40 of the seed of <95 who are
<8258 <17561 upon all the face of the <1175

5:25 And as he hath covenanted with all the <122 of <27 even so
<81 the <784 <8539 he hath <16 with the <15 of Jacob
be <395 in his own due <14135 unto the restoring all the <16 of
<17 unto the <98 of the <32 that he hath <32 with
<2032

5:26 And then <48 they know <114 <8295 who is <244 <244 the
Son of God; and then <16 they be <2640 in from the four <114
of the <115 unto <27 own <1841 from <16712 they have been
dispersed; yea, as the Lord <8151 so <30 it be. <12690

3 <1100 <1100 6

6:1 And now it came to pass that the <264 of the <1095 did all
<1978 to <48 own <2706 in the <718 and <2196 <3201 <1889 man, with
his family, his <2640 and his <3177 his <2650 and his <2650 and
all <373 <11233 did <14557 unto <118

6:2 And it came to pass that they had not eaten up all <50
provisions; <1621 they did take with them all that they had not
devoured, of all <18 <14809 of <62 <2693 and <6 <11225 and <3
<11225 and all <5 <13717 <5998 and they did <90 to <8 own
<91 and <5 <3963 both on the <6160 and on the <6159 both
on the land <14707 and on the land southward.

6:3 And they granted unto <414 <1080 who had <21967 into a <223
to keep the <5903 of the <3132 who were desirous to <5060 <3736
<193 <366 to <55 <14412 that they <700 <8592 with <7
labors, <283 to <2703 upon; and thus they did <767 <33 in
all the <3215

6:4 And they <1688 <387 to <13846 and to wax great; and the <186
and <187 and <5294 <967 <967 <995 and <588 was <951 <18882 in
the <2799 and they had <22282 <56 laws <67 to equity and
justice.

6:5 And now <26 was <1984 in all the land to hinder the <246 from
prospering <9166 <3786 they <746 fall into <827

6:6 And now it was Gidgiddoni, and the <16070 <3236 and <138 who
had been <2111 <15457 who had <857 this <70 <105 in the
<104

6:7 And it came to pass that <62 were many <3070 <3910 anew, and
<8 were many old <9 repaired.

6:8 And <11 were many <9787 cast up, and many roads <2450 <662
led from city to <10444 and from land to <190 and from <809 to <2155

6:9 And thus <143 away the <153 and <5437 <339 and the <113 had
continual <14918

6:10 But it came to pass in the <22 and <5451 year <62 <190 to be
some disputings <929 the <1069 and some were <13808 up unto <8046
and boastings <1424 of <179 <3319 <121 <11276 yea, even unto
<6 persecutions;

6:11 For <37 were many merchants in the <84 and also many lawyers,
and many officers.

6:12 And the <78 <58 to be distinguished by ranks, <220 to
<46 <11302 and <3 chances for learning, yea, some were ignorant
<60 of <11 poverty, and <14353 did <2659 <58 learning <10
of <11 riches.

6:13 Some were <88 up in <11971 and <21 were <85 humble;
some did <395 railing for railing, <9882 <12 <1239 <33 <7
and persecution and all <2924 of <14020 and <12 not turn and
<16231 <5718 but were <15608 and penitent <854 God.

6:14 And thus <114 <2191 a <66 inequality in all the <116 <766
that the <1123 <106 to be <10011 up; yea, <11 that in the
thirtieth year the <15 was <13 up in all the land save it were
<184 a few of the <5246 who were <5357 unto the true faith;
and they <76 not depart from it, for they were firm, and steadfast,
and immovable, willing with all <1571 to keep the <825 of
the <6413

6:15 Now the <1542 of this <6615 of the <187 was this—Satan had
<96 <16682 unto the stirring up of the <13 to do all <135 of
<8231 and to the puffing them up with <169 <5777 them to seek
for <29 and <23368 and <259 and the vain <630 of the <5664

6:16 And thus <5813 did lead away the <1855 of the <48 to do all
<49 of <11919 <631 they had enjoyed <414 but a few years.

6:17 And <13841 in the <1137 of the <158 year—the <30
<3343 been <1844 up for the <1429 of a long time to be carried
<2438 by the temptations of the <8543 <23326 he <18279 to <14634
<1969 and to do <711 <129 he <11 they should—and thus in
the <49 of <4578 the <50 <408 they were in a <5235 of
<21500 <16244

6:18 Now they did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of God
<7409 <48 for it had been <24202 unto <1714 <108 they did
wilfully rebel <1654 God.

6:19 And now it was in the days of <552 the son of <4 for
<3857 did fill the seat of his <5785 and did govern the <125
that <2775

6:20 And <319 <306 to be men inspired from <8208 and sent <2104
<17205 <292 the <24 in all the <330 <5769 and testifying
boldly of the sins and <9824 of the <1422 and <12 unto
them <95 the <19532 <563 the Lord <307 make for his
<17 or in <4963 <4963 the <10761 of <5873 and they did
<19512 <39 of his <5733 and sufferings.

6:21 Now <74 were many of the <64 who were <444 <8996
<465 of <665 who <6961 of <1427 <17344 and <7 who were
<15 were chiefly the <4284 <8490 and they who had been high priests
and lawyers; yea, all <22 who were lawyers were <23 with <7 who
<37 of <37 <17399

6:22 Now <61 was no lawyer nor <7827 nor high priest that <2847 have
<2322 to <20301 any one to <88 save <533 condemnation was signed by
the <4705 of the <728

6:23 Now <37 were many of <53 who <52 of the <363
<10803 to <2081 who <9 boldly, who were <1509 and put to
<42 secretly by the <97 that the <1138 of <49 <10 came
not unto the <49 of the land <1494 <1640 <13 <10800

6:24 Now <1683 this was <8653 to the laws of the <215 that any
man <835 be put to <37 <842 they had <99 from the <38 of
the land—

6:25 <1557 a complaint came up unto the land of <4204 to the
<22 of the <41 <318 <149 <8125 who had <1972 the
<2211 of the Lord unto <10797 not <696 to the law.

6:26 Now it came to pass that they were <116 and <1436 up <638 the
<174 to be judged of the <20615 <280 they had <16541 <34 to the
law <9 had been <1451 by the <6672

6:27 Now it came to pass that <171 <70 had many friends and
kindreds; and the remainder, yea, even <19652 all the <244 and the
high priests, did <1384 <2651 <4330 and <5277 with the
kindreds of <33 <33 who were to be tried <62 to the law.

6:28 And they did <2122 into a <1110 one with <23816 yea, even
into that <9 <81 was <80 by them of old, <7 <9 was
<9 and administered by the <6503 to combine <154 all
<11051

6:29 <179 they did <12 <12 the <365 of the <4614 and
<52 into a <34 to <3896 <512 and to <3619 <80 who were
<21984 of <2210 from the grasp of justice, <54 was <591 to be
<54 <92 to the law.

6:30 And they did set at defiance the law and the <5170 of <281
country; and they did <52 one with <3189 to <55 the
<5088 and to <1188 a king over the <246 that the land <286
no more be at liberty but <8 be subject unto kings.

3 <1406 <1406 7

7:1 Now <325 I will show unto you that they did not <44 a king
over the <1198 but in this same <656 yea, the <660 <4 they did
<69 upon the <10696 seat, yea, did <120 the <486 <275 of the
<427

7:2 And the <156 were <17031 one <162 <23553 and they did
separate one from <105 into tribes, <1385 man <139 to his
family and his kindred and friends; and thus they did <53 the
government of the <45

7:3 And <28 tribe did <4869 a <61 or a <5895 over <703 and thus
they <977 tribes and leaders of tribes.

7:4 Now <120 <499 was no man <662 them save he had much <59 and
many <307 and <60 <736 <190 <30 <32 <610
<5139

7:5 Now all this was <379 and <34 were no wars as yet <36 <58
and all this <816 had come upon the <122 <638 they did <3007
<357 unto the <484 of Satan.

7:6 And the regulations of the <108 were destroyed, <23 of
the <2461 combination of the <403 and <71 of <298 who
<18441 the <7173

7:7 And they did <1002 a <993 contention in the <256 <1077 that
the more <10898 part of the <65 had nearly all <2166 <22976
yea, <90 were but few <16 men <90 <1609

7:8 And thus six <1453 had not <1312 away <3807 the more part of the
<35 had <12256 from <137 <2950 like the dog to his vomit,
or like the sow to her wallowing in the mire.

7:9 Now this <101 combination, <381 had <546 so <84 <141
upon the <813 did <494 <137 <494 and did <1377 at <45
head a man whom they did call Jacob;

7:10 And they did call him <19 king; <204 he <203 a king over
this <5488 band; and he was one of the <5169 who had <489 his
<8131 <311 the <633 who <732 of Jesus.

7:11 And it came to pass that they were not so <4676 in <16112 as the
<252 of the <83 who were <6465 <4819 save it were <63
<293 did <397 <5 laws, <316 one <344 to his tribe;
<2195 they were <2962 <3954 they were not a
<178 <33 yet they were <34 in the <6023 of <229 who had
<1703 into a <489 to <364 the government.

7:12 <4521 <1942 <20213 that <49 <4790 were more <23891 than
they, he <2469 the king of the <20005 <130 he <3969 his <204
that they <497 take <25 flight into the northernmost part of the
<264 and <248 <16508 up unto <182 a kingdom, <834 they were
joined by <16211 (for he flattered them that <19 <1019 be many
dissenters) and they <279 <3707 <136 to <9310 with the
<136 of the <1542 and they did so.

7:13 And so speedy was <62 <3455 that it <953 not be impeded <52
they had gone <4788 out of the reach of the <778 And thus <6444 the
<546 <7043 and thus were the <9578 of the <103 of <2617

7:14 And it came to pass in the thirty and <2575 year that they were
<549 into <538 <194 man <194 to his <1985 <535 and
<476 <197 they had come to an <19160 that they <110 not
go to war one with <576 but they were not <204 as to <95 <231
and <4 <1353 of <5867 for they were <1769 <45 to
the minds of <220 who were <17 chiefs and <3 leaders. But they
did <262 very strict laws that one <580 <196 not trespass
<315 <827 <454 that in some degree they had <1391 in the
<677 <2829 <32 <1413 were <424 from the Lord <7 God,
and they did stone the <343 and did cast them out from <466 <466

7:15 And it came to pass that Nephi—having been <16158 by <9643 and
also the <374 of the <844 <270 <1425 seen <18235 and <281
eye-witness, and <8 had <572 <393 unto him that he <1995 know
<1274 the ministry of <2226 and also <22 eye-witness to <70
<15583 <1682 from <3528 unto <7 <6010 and <7335

7:16 <334 <19 grieved for the <14494 of <15 <99 and the
blindness of <7 minds—went <246 <87 them in that same <784 and
<1361 to testify, <1177 <3348 and <7986 of sins <11114
<7573 on the Lord <2288 <10800

7:17 And he did <25273 many <1207 unto <678 and all of them <2967
be <6624 and a part of them <231 not suffice, <115 they are
not <2992 in this book. And <875 did <33 with <118 and with
<568 authority.

7:18 And it came to pass that they were <1318 with him, even <697 he
had <8985 <27 than <436 for it were not possible that they <360
<7570 his <1409 for so <40 was his <95 on the Lord <95
<1289 that <193 did <59 unto him <11100

7:19 And in the name of <19 did he cast out devils and unclean
spirits; and even his <19249 did he <4856 from the <8493 <1294 he had
been <13269 and <22018 <1276 by the <408

7:20 And the <400 saw it, and did <9608 of it, and were <100 with
him <100 of his power; and he did also do many more miracles, in the
sight of the <583 in the name of <645

7:21 And it came to pass that the <435 and <435 year did pass <2225
and <525 were but few who were <1864 unto the <11413 but as many as
were <10 did truly signify unto the <80 that they had been
<334 by the <170 and <10504 of God, <770 was in <135 <311 in
whom they believed.

7:22 And as many as had <146 cast out from <1190 and were healed of
<301 sicknesses and <3 infirmities, did <53 <20898 unto the
<54 that they had been <7754 upon by the <52 of God, and had
been healed; and they did show <331 <3573 also and did do some
<9228 <339 the <173

7:23 Thus <888 away the <126 and <3345 year <23770 And <293 did
cry unto the <53 in the <1809 of the <18 and <3354 <604
and he did <10316 unto them <367 and <367 of <8353

7:24 Now I <340 have you to <10516 <3377 that <164 were none who
were <902 unto <26 who were not <10702 with water.

7:25 <433 <20 were ordained of <3275 men unto this ministry,
that all such as <559 come unto them <4 be <28 with water,
and this as a <265 and a <19135 <1492 God, and unto the <247
that they had <13441 and <6419 a <82 of <164 <83

7:26 And <55 were many in the <112 of this year that were
<47 unto <12769 and thus the more part of the year did pass
<3460

3 <147 <1315 8

8:1 And now it came to pass that <670 to our record, and we know
our <3121 to be <20734 for <1215 it was a just man who did keep the
record—for he <240 did many <209 in the name of Jesus; and <82
was not any man who <457 do a <18584 in the name of <297 save he
were cleansed <775 whit from his <11308

8:2 And now it came to <8366 if <37 was no mistake made by this man
in the reckoning of our <2906 the <239 and <239 year had <265
away;

8:3 And the <259 <614 to look with <515 earnestness for the sign
<363 had been <685 by the <6181 <9496 the <10984 yea, for the
time that <57 <214 be <8831 for the <2134 of <12213 days over the
face of the <1380

8:4 And <22 <49 to be <48 doubtings and disputations <339 the
<227 <1065 so many <354 had been <8809

8:5 And it came to pass in the <93 and <8377 <698 in the <480
month, on the <9 day of the <7 <46 <19289 a <45 storm, such
an one as <5086 had been <5087 in all the <69

8:6 And <23 was also a <24 and <5114 tempest; and <9 was
<6 thunder, <875 that it did <12567 the <9026 <3004 as if it
was <1646 to divide asunder.

8:7 And <27 were <1439 sharp lightnings, such as <56 had been
<57 in all the <57

8:8 And the city of <6079 did take <26296

8:9 And the city of Moroni did sink into the <25716 of the sea, and the
inhabitants <4423 were drowned.

8:10 And the <73 was <2308 up upon the city of Moronihah that in
the <1331 of the city <75 <1311 a <110 mountain.

8:11 And <10 was a <10 and <114 <4711 in the land
<2950

8:12 But <346 <18 was a more <19 and <19 <19 in the
land <25756 for <15 the <135 face of the land was changed,
<713 of the tempest and the whirlwinds and the <12520 and the
<136 and the <141 <37 quaking of the <29 <20585

8:13 And the <2814 were <2576 up, and the level <2816 were spoiled,
and many smooth <4605 <95 rough.

8:14 And many <35 and notable <2850 were sunk, and many were burned,
and many were <26524 till the buildings <148 had <5440 to the
<4554 and the <158 <10 were <4122 and the <42 were left
<5957

8:15 And <119 were some <43 <369 remained; but the damage <24
was <91 <22464 and <15 were many of them who were <4640

8:16 And <13 were some who were <195 away in the whirlwind; and
<9995 they went no man knoweth, save they know that they were <19
<553

8:17 And thus the face of the <139 <230 <118 deformed, <164 of
the <12781 and the thunderings, and the <161 and the <159
of the <3422

8:18 And <197 the <12896 were rent in twain; they were <165 up upon
the face of the <44 <129 <355 that they were <4166 in <16
fragments, and in <12863 and in <12863 upon all the face of the <339

8:19 And it came to pass that when the <69 and the <69
and the <429 and the <12731 and the quakings of the <95 did
cease—for <73 they did last for <401 the <515 of <515 hours; and
it was said by some that the time was greater; <1295 all <2264
<235 and <307 <1158 were done in <29 the <29 of <29
hours—and then <42 <180 was <556 upon the face of the <84

8:20 And it came to pass that <19 was thick <20 upon all the
face of the <1548 <128 that the <258 <234 who had not
<271 <685 feel the vapor of <9635

8:21 And <33 <12 be no light, <196 of the <13920 <5409
candles, <3 torches; <2 <14 <16 be fire <14512 with
<814 fine and <273 dry wood, so that <14 <16 not be any
<9463 at all;

8:22 And <14 was not any <12 <23815 <36 <26705 nor glimmer,
<5 the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so <134 were the
mists of <102 <329 were upon the face of the <124

8:23 And it came to pass that it did last for the <155 of <155 days
that <58 was no <57 <9390 and <6 was <44 <23750 and howling
and weeping <696 all the <756 <10682 yea, <13 were the
groanings of the <706 <126 of the <62 and the <14
<511 <67 had come upon <1487

8:24 And in one <563 they were <8870 to cry, <4914 O that we had
<962 <973 this <30 and <235 day, and then <1040 our
<4480 have been spared, and they <9 not have been burned in that
<23 city Zarahemla.

8:25 And in <2197 <48 they were <48 to cry and <20741 <50 O
that we had <50 <50 this <27 and <50 day, and had not
<14594 and <1322 the <8691 and cast them out; then <53 our
mothers and our fair daughters, and our <3929 have been <69 and
not have been <12349 up in that <41 city Moronihah. And thus were the
howlings of the <149 <12 and terrible.

3 <1031 <1031 9

9:1 And it came to pass that <182 was a <1616 <91 <178 all the
<317 of the <452 upon all the face of this <331 crying:

9:2 Wo, wo, wo unto this <1850 wo unto the <25 of the <478
<428 <2697 they <3815 <22973 for the <3058 laugheth, and his <1475
rejoice, <212 of the <12399 of the fair sons and <8439 of my
<36 and it is <17 of <340 <2116 and <15700 that they
are fallen!

9:3 <4401 that <107 city <837 have I <196 with <333 and the
<64 thereof.

9:4 And <448 that <20 city <845 have I <7454 to be sunk in the
<850 of the sea, and the <27 <433 to be <850

9:5 And <30 that <30 city <845 have I covered with <132
and the <23 <6060 to hide <80 <3025 and <3
<82 from <234 my <20597 that the <20648 of the <1808 and
the <13355 <130 not come any more unto me <1850 <326

9:6 And <51 the city of Gilgal have I <81 to be <784 and the
<52 <75 to be <240 up in the <89 of the <834

9:7 Yea, and the city of Onihah and the <24 <76 and the
city of Mocum and the <10 <10 and the city of <10894
and the <10 thereof; and <17080 have I <57 to come up in the
stead <23 to hide <106 <1833 and <107 from <107 my
<108 that the <108 of the <108 and the <107 <107 not come up
any more unto me <109 <109

9:8 And <109 the city of Gadiandi, and the city of Gadiomnah, and
the city of <4181 and the city of Gimgimno, all <677 have I <70 to
be <128 and made <17326 and <13562 in the <892 <88 and the
<93 <137 have I <137 up in the <137 of the <204 to
hide <91 <91 and <91 from <91 my <90 that the
<91 of the <91 and the <91 <1268 not come up any more unto
me <91 <91

9:9 And <91 that <251 city Jacobugath, <541 was inhabited by the
<418 of king <90 have I <83 to be <314 with fire <339 of
<60 sins and <3 <4973 <26 was <13692 all the <69 of
the <389 <79 <19 of <15 <2481 <4984 and combinations; for
it was they that did <2347 the <2106 of my <50 and the <2608
of the <2112 <1949 I did <2588 them to be <1046 to <22 them
from <111 my <111 that the <110 of the <110 and the <110
<111 not come up unto me any more <110 <110

9:10 And <110 the city of Laman, and the city of Josh, and the city
of Gad, and the city of Kishkumen, have I <116 to be <116 with
<431 and the <191 <271 <102 of <102 <111 in
casting out the <600 and stoning <2236 whom I did send to <4844
unto them <2141 <21 <21 and <3 <16140

9:11 And <33 they did cast them all out, that <571 were none
<2499 <571 <1832 I did send down fire and <120 <8 that <31
<35 and <236 <2184 be hid from <128 my <128 that the
<129 of the <129 and the <129 whom I sent <36 them <22 not
cry unto me from the ground <134 <134

9:12 And many <243 destructions have I <116 to come upon this <621
and upon this <805 <83 of <61 <60 and <3
<96

9:13 O all ye that are spared <18 ye were more <93 than <2121
will ye not now <2252 unto me, and <5338 of your <5415 and be
<10126 that I may heal you?

9:14 Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me ye <431 have

<13703 will <5523 him will I receive; and <4698 are <194 who come
unto me.

9:15 <31 I am <1727 <2177 the Son of God. I <17858 the <27609
and the <335 and all <1120 that in them are. I was with the <10772
from the beginning. I am in the Father, and the <12 in me; and in me
hath the <9 glorified his <14569

9:16 I came unto my own, and my own <1897 me not. And the <10295
<266 my <8980 are <5633

9:17 And as many as have <21 me, to them have I <1750 to <2671
the sons of God; and even so will I to as many as <145 <8733 on my
name, for <366 by me <3726 <15132 and in me is the law of
<23381 <54

9:18 I am the <1069 and the life of the <3970 I am Alpha and Omega,
the <25661 and the end.

9:19 And ye <53 offer up unto me no more the <8521 of <22832 yea,
your sacrifices and your burnt offerings <19 be done <2247 for I will
accept none of your <17 and your <17 offerings.

9:20 And ye <23 <42 for a sacrifice unto me a <1391 <11156 and a
<23487 spirit. And <16525 <14509 unto me with a <14 <14 and a
<14 <8932 him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost,
even as the <4590 <331 of <346 <2431 in me at the time of
<9 <27489 were <2072 with fire and with the Holy <27 and
they knew it not.

9:21 <281 I have come unto the <11099 to <4980 <171 unto the
<11054 to save the <11 from sin.

9:22 <2182 <86 <14608 and <88 unto me as a <12417 <13849
him will I receive, for of such is the kingdom of God. <48 for such
I have laid down my <21025 and have <3681 it up again; <636 <13057
and come unto me ye ends of the <340 and be <15426

3 <1123 <1123 10

10:1 And now <257 it came to pass that all the <680 of the land
did hear <817 sayings, and did <2240 of it. And <2532 <9 sayings
<575 was silence in the land for the <1348 of many <1532

10:2 For so <533 was the <22716 of the <43 that they did
<19901 lamenting and <1355 for the loss of <177 <2925 <768 had
been slain; <99 <45 was <45 in all the land for the <46
of many <14351

10:3 And it came to pass that <24 came a <1215 <4778 unto the <577
and all the <57 did hear, and did <94 of it, <1317

10:4 O ye <15 of <101 <81 <1793 <62 have fallen, who are
<19324 of <855 yea, who are of the <5103 of Israel, how oft have
I <5069 you as a hen gathereth her chickens <14770 her wings, and
have nourished you.

10:5 And <4524 how oft <1348 I have <27 you as a hen <27
her <28 <28 her <28 yea, O ye <69 of the <53 of <53
who have fallen; yea, O ye <13 of the <13 of <13 ye that <8069
at <5378 as ye that have <20 yea, how oft <51 I have
<52 you as a hen <52 her chickens, and ye <14 not.

10:6 O ye <39 of Israel whom I have <1414 how oft will I <3414 you
as a hen <30 her <81 <81 her <81 if ye will <712 and
<719 unto me with full purpose of <17650

10:7 But if not, O <45 of <84 the <1083 of your dwellings <469
<581 desolate <3222 the time of the <17918 of the <3338 to
your <11577

10:8 And now it came to pass that <305 the <125 had <1447 <208
<2893 <336 they <2333 to weep and howl <243 <468 of the loss of
<286 <286 and friends.

10:9 And it came to pass that thus did the <1678 days pass <1985 And it
was in the morning, and the <1655 <28562 from off the face of the
<868 and the <1472 did <338 to <21987 and the <1974 did <7 to
rend, and the dreadful <1690 did cease, and all the tumultuous
noises did pass <49

<21256 And the <34 did cleave <3500 <259 that it stood; and the
mourning, and the weeping, and the wailing of the <116 who were
<906 alive did <20216 and <105 <1754 was <3230 into joy, and
<8 lamentations into the <9682 and thanksgiving unto the Lord <843
<2868 <13 Redeemer.

<21292 And thus far were the <790 <5460 <361 had been <8330
by the <3753

<21270 And it was the more <957 part of the <64 who were <14656
and it was they who <807 the <1036 and <1706 them not; and it
was they who had not shed the <1054 of the saints, who were spared—

<21239 And they were <101 and were not sunk and <1335 up in the
<1470 and they were not drowned in the <1344 of the sea; and they
were not <1176 by <1175 <1936 were they <2006 upon and crushed to
<14621 and they were not <2213 away in the <2232 <19 were
they overpowered by the <2025 of smoke and of darkness.

<21268 And now, <687 readeth, let him understand; he that hath the
<14216 let him <19622 <1168 and see and <6201 if all <308 deaths
and <1132 by <66 and by smoke, and by <2249 and by
whirlwinds, and by the opening of the <238 to <5036 <33 and all
<30 <1026 are not unto the <368 of the <9042 of many of
the holy <191

<21310 <736 I say unto you, Yea, many have <3801 of <31 <31
at the <1006 of <234 and were <1775 <369 they <15 of <15
<4610

<21285 Yea, the <2754 <24199 did <4687 of <14 <5508 and also
Zenock <13743 <1039 <8 <8 <28 they <28
particularly <8 us, who are the <5773 of <277 seed.

<21278 <67 our <4795 <3778 also <21 <19 a <16 of
the seed of <5875 And <439 are not we a <13 of the seed of
Joseph? And <49 <86 <301 <62 of us, are they not <3405 upon
the <6294 of brass <14 our <45 Lehi <3071 out of <12981

<21289 And it came to pass that in the ending of the <2793 and <2784
<2794 <57 I will show unto you that the <330 of <851 who were
<593 and also <1232 who had been <6272 <979 who had been
<13 did have <736 favors <14039 unto <199 and <6 blessings
poured out upon <121 heads, <2306 that soon <551 the ascension of
<1253 into <4899 he did <3011 <3251 <6044 unto <14444

<21330 Showing his body unto <36 and ministering unto <3536 and an
<6118 of his <3619 <614 be <1197 hereafter. <4500 for this
time I make an end of my sayings.

3 <92 <943 11

11:1 And now it came to pass that <852 were a <83 <21455 <724
<4109 of the <118 of <3205 <7732 <2432 the <21836 <161 was in
the land Bountiful; and they were marveling and wondering one with
<3770 and were <13811 one to <2197 the <38 and <9358 <14548
<29 had <1028 <5523 3 <65 11:2 And they were also conversing <44
this <536 <301 of whom the sign had been <101 <253 his
<4822

11:3 And it came to pass that <5405 they were thus <31 one with
<59 they <710 a <945 as if it came out of <21946 and they cast
<182 eyes <97 <11061 for they <11636 not the <21 <72 they
heard; and it was not a harsh <7242 <476 was it a loud voice;
<2565 and <3070 it <3770 a <6434 <26 it did pierce
them that did hear to the center, <227 that <157 was no part of
<55 frame that it did not <1778 to quake; yea, it did <29 them to
the very <29295 and did <15 <22 <3809 to burn.

11:4 And it came to pass that <804 they <107 the <75 and they
<93 it not.

11:5 And <16 the <3222 time they did hear the <20 and did open
<43 ears to hear it; and <6 eyes were <1582 the sound <1974
and they did look <12619 <10 <11346 from <6102 the <13
<12235

11:6 And <376 the <45 time they did understand the <125 <151
they <151 and it said unto <9375

11:7 <12737 my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have
<1568 my name—hear ye him.

11:8 And it came to <3335 as they <106 they cast <82 eyes up
<105 <74 <219 and <64 they saw a Man descending out of
<11 and he was clothed in a <10800 robe; and he came down and <8186
in the <21825 of <395 and the eyes of the <2000 <356 were <852
upon him, and they <8700 not open <55 mouths, even one to <284
and wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an <15553 that had
appeared unto <1839

11:9 And it came to pass that he <18747 <3693 his hand and <624
unto the <1262 <1250

<21313 <612 I am <365 <365 whom the <856 <615 <466 come
into the <1614

<21292 And <119 I am the <1630 and the life of the world; and I have
drunk out of that bitter cup <195 the <1738 hath <399 me, and have
<176 the <9 in taking upon me the sins of the <1511 in the
<24 I have <3941 the will of the <21 in all <658 from the
<1792

<21320 And it came to pass that when <89 had <973 <678 <7367 the
<163 <163 fell to the <913 for they <17233 that it had been
<18863 <1992 them that <604 <2127 show <600 unto them <615
his <616 into <16668

<21341 And it came to pass that the Lord <151 unto them <149

<21307 Arise and come <166 unto me, that ye may thrust your <7546 into
my <8274 and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my <18
and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of <1271 and the
God of the <102 <1590 and have been <865 for the sins of the <198

<21318 And it came to pass that the <124 went <5607 and <70
<282 <53 into his <70 and did feel the <67 of the <67 in his
<15 and in his feet; and this they did do, <12686 <105 one by one
<1329 they had all gone <41 and did see with <42 eyes and did feel
with <7 hands, and did know of a <16904 and did bear <3807 that it
was he, of whom it was <874 by the <2254 that <187 <13608

<21383 And when they had all gone <60 and had <15315 for
<11957 they did cry out with one accord, <187

<21367 Hosanna! <7769 be the name of the Most High God! And they did
fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.

<21325 And it came to pass that he <231 unto <746 (for <2 was <264
the multitude) and he <4751 him that he <83 come <28195

<21295 And <20 <3717 and went <133 and <13071 <283 <2298 the Lord
and did kiss his feet.

<21295 And the Lord <36 him that he <36 arise. And he <31 and
<507 <28 him.

<21248 And the Lord said unto him: I give unto you <4221 that ye <442
<1961 this <868 when I am <562 ascended into <334

<21196 And <9 the Lord <989 <12493 and said unto them likewise;
and he gave unto them <36 to baptize. And he said unto <637 On this
wise <45 ye baptize; and <766 <5 be no <3864 <127 you.

<21204 Verily I say unto you, that <1268 <1955 of his sins <4542
your <429 and desireth to be <2011 in my <2163 on this wise <36
ye <87 them—Behold, ye <6 go down and <11023 in the <4148 and in
my name <13 ye <18 <586

<21189 And now <546 <472 are the <45 <506 ye <17 say, calling
them by <46 <249

<21117 Having <21496 <542 me of <498 <587 I <35 you in the
name of the <2308 and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. <6871

<21092 And then <45 ye immerse them in the <74 and come <310 <160
out of the <4259

<21068 And <516 this <4838 <24 ye <51 in my name; for <83
<2443 I say unto you, that the <57 and the Son, and the Holy Ghost
are one; and I am in the <16 and the <604 in me, and the <5
and I are one.

<21091 And <4213 as I have <277 you thus <58 ye <216 And
<205 <6 be no <205 <205 you, as <8 have <26798 been;
<1012 <13 <7 be <13 <13 you <1078 the <21386 of
my <21388 as <13 have <20 been.

<21086 For verily, <92 I say unto you, he that hath the <10345 of
<5372 is not of me, but is of the <5728 who is the <1333 of
contention, and he stirreth up the <1014 of men to <5098 with <19158
one with another.

<21094 <792 this is not my <66 to stir up the <25 of men
with <24 one <2676 <5020 but this is my <18 that such
<743 <396 be done <1775

<21088 <36 <87 <1 I say unto you, I will <2779 unto you
my doctrine.

<21062 And this is my <36 and it is the <12281 <286 the <177
hath <275 unto me; and I bear <4379 of the <197 and the <15
beareth <9 of me, and the Holy <218 <8 <8 of the <14
and me; and I bear <10 that the <10 commandeth all men,
everywhere, to <2003 and <2541 in me.

<21069 And <398 believeth in me, and is <15038 the same <205 be
<19248 and they are they who <9 inherit the <2354 of God.

<21052 And <29 <29 not in me, and is not <31 <20 be
damned.

<21040 Verily, <132 I say unto you, that this is my <120 and I
bear <81 of it from the Father; and <39 <39 in me <3
in the <93 <12116 and unto him will the <7 bear <24 of me, for
he will <11328 him with fire and with the Holy <405

<21080 And thus will the <26 bear <26 of me, and the Holy <149
will bear <10 unto him of the <17 and me; for the <175 and I,
and the Holy <21 are one.

<21070 And <433 I say unto you, ye must <2466 and <2139 as a <2503
<2504 and be <548 in my <502 or ye can in nowise <1792 <521
<1742

<21067 And <35 I say unto you, ye must <35 and be <28 in my
<29 and <42 as a <42 <41 or ye can in <35 <188 the
<189 of God.

11:39 <171 <171 I say unto you, that this is my <171 and
<162 buildeth upon this <3 upon my <20578 and the gates of hell
<206 not prevail <353 <604

11:40 And <24 <11 <334 more or less than <6655 and <5350 it
for my <41 the same <2621 of <16560 and is not <7130 upon my
rock; but he <50 upon a sandy foundation, and the <51 of hell
<663 open to <126 such when the floods come and the winds beat upon
<62

11:41 <2669 go <605 unto this <1241 and <66 the <669 <383
I have <14827 unto the ends of the <4204

3 <859 <1692 12

12:1 And it came to pass that when <679 had <1177 <184 <34 unto
<1687 and to <1801 who had been called, (now the <5739 of them who
had been <10 and <2146 <812 and <712 to baptize, was
twelve) and <656 he <1322 <76 his hand unto the <23185 and
<13936 unto <1787 <739 <983 are ye if ye <155 give heed unto the
<58 of <61 twelve whom I have <16551 from <617 you to <5256
unto you, and to be your servants; and unto them I have <495 <62
that they may <719 you with water; and <729 that ye are <266
with <751 <71 I will <16 you with fire and with the Holy
Ghost; <2689 <3146 are ye if ye <70 <489 in me and be
<450 <35 that ye have seen me and know that I am.

12:2 And <2360 more <31 are they who <30 <30 in your <98
<2061 that ye <9 <2015 that ye have seen me, and that ye know
that I am. Yea, <29 are they who <20 <29 in your <2494 and
come down into the <2266 of <8837 and be <68 for they <19
be <5252 with fire and with the Holy <2957 and <12 <273 a
<5063 of <1212 <5063

12:3 Yea, <48 are the poor in <751 who come unto me, for theirs
is the <388 of <1053

12:4 And <102 <24 are all they that <4100 for they <45 be
comforted.

12:5 And <17 are the <28700 for they <15 <424 the <298

12:6 And <15 are all they who do hunger and thirst <160
<6129 for they <23 be <22512 with the Holy <559

12:7 And <26 are the merciful, for they <18 <9560 mercy.

12:8 And <14 are all the pure in <9186 for they <17 see God.

12:9 And <17 are all the peacemakers, for they <15 be <1149 the
<4158 of God.

<21107 And <20 are all they who are persecuted for my name’s sake,
for <135 is the <134 of <134

<21106 And <24 are ye when men <42 <7386 you and persecute, and
<7 say all <1029 of evil <511 you falsely, for my sake;

<21119 For ye <18 have <2069 joy and be <4446 glad, for <7
<11 be your reward in <1791 for so <67 they the <1700 who
were <1279 you.

<21132 <585 <585 I say unto you, I give unto you to be the salt of
the <1630 but if the salt <43 lose its savor <7814 <5 the
<2454 be salted? The salt <8 be thenceforth good for nothing, but to
be cast out and to be <16603 <2872 foot of men.

<21177 <59 <59 I say unto you, I give unto you to be the <1765
of this <5489 A city that is set on a hill <5798 be hid.

<21184 <981 do men <23 a candle and put it <50 a bushel? Nay, but
on a candlestick, and it giveth <18 to all that are in the house;

<21173 <2295 let your <15 so shine <137 this <615 that they
may see your good <12004 and <22813 your <821 who is in <217

<21179 Think not that I am come to <3784 the law or the <2567 I am
not come to <12 but to fulfil;

<21175 For <1156 I say unto you, one jot nor <13782 hath not <5335
away from the law, but in me it hath all been <3537

<21164 And <553 I have <575 you the law and the <7571 of my
<896 that ye <193 <491 in me, and that ye <7 <1048 of your
<3764 and come unto me with a <3482 <3482 and a <3481 <3495
<162 ye have the <37 <128 you, and the law is <59

<21190 <145 come unto me and be ye <1067 for <97 I say unto
you, that <4453 ye <53 keep my <29412 <769 I have <1315
you at this <5449 ye <14 in no case <6964 into the <379 of <162

<21210 Ye have <2257 that it hath been said by them of old <28 and it
is also <1751 <76 you, that thou <21223 not <28912 and <3824
<43 kill <2 be in danger of the <6879 of God;

<21225 But I say unto you, that <23 is <5937 with his <5975
<26 be in <26 of his <26573 And <15 <9 say to his
<23000 Raca, <7 be in <16 of the council; and <16 <9
say, Thou fool, <5 be in <14 of hell <5361

<21235 <901 if ye <14 come unto me, or <5 <10038 to come unto
me, and rememberest that thy <62 hast aught <480 thee—

<21233 Go thy way unto thy <60 and <5497 be reconciled to thy
<8 and then come unto me with full <3270 of <582 and I will
<701 you.

<21230 Agree with <19141 adversary quickly <2537 thou art in the way with
him, lest at any time he <73 get <24662 and thou <161 be cast into
<24159

<21219 <451 <451 I say unto <18 thou <17 by no <15054 come out
thence <1980 thou hast paid the uttermost senine. And <52 ye are in
prison can ye pay even one senine? <35 <35 I say unto you, Nay.

12:27 <302 it is <225 by them of old <236 that thou <50 not
<14025 adultery;

12:28 But I say unto you, that <185 looketh on a woman, to lust
<744 her, hath committed adultery <9567 in his <3403

12:29 <47 I give unto you a commandment, that ye <17171 none of
<1000 <1515 to <313 into your <21048

12:30 For it is <16921 that ye <1530 deny <12651 of <21 <2986
wherein ye will take up your cross, than that ye <17 be cast into
<30091

12:31 It hath been <6373 that <83 <171 put away his wife, let
him give her a writing of divorcement.

12:32 <139 <139 I say unto you, that <26 <26 put away his
<27 saving for the <2657 of fornication, causeth her to <137
<138 and <1259 <20 marry her who is divorced committeth
adultery.

12:33 And <1347 it is <66 thou <164 not forswear thyself, but
<6 perform unto the Lord <264 oaths;

12:34 But <64 <1 I say unto you, <12699 not at all; <1758 by
<2654 for it is God’s throne;

12:35 Nor by the <2290 for it is his footstool;

12:36 Neither <49 thou <33 by thy head, <1078 thou <19462 not make
one hair black or white;

12:37 But let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for <8025
<1350 of more than <186 is <20033

12:38 And <619 it is <105 an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth;

12:39 But I say unto you, that ye <146 not resist <1390 but <172
<7 <24777 thee on thy <13151 cheek, turn to him the <7932 <1602

12:40 And if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat,
let him have thy cloak <26

12:41 And <46 <45 compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.

12:42 Give to him that asketh <415 and from him that <3784 borrow of
thee turn not <1836

12:43 And <3398 it is <392 <6311 that thou <169 love thy neighbor
and hate <220 enemy;

12:44 But I say unto you, love your <17522 <9246 them that <11947 you,
do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use
you and persecute you;

12:45 That ye may be the <1104 of your <868 who is in <1033 for
he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good.

12:46 <767 <1476 <422 <748 were of old <480 <5 were <946
the law, in me are all <790

12:47 Old <22 are done <4341 and all <6 have <1674 new.

12:48 <38 I <142 that ye <430 be perfect even as I, or your
<76 who is in <3295 is perfect.

3 <1562 <1562 13

13:1 <423 <358 I say that I <36 that ye <36 do alms unto the
poor; but take heed that ye do not your alms <797 men to be seen of
<2926 otherwise ye have no <1162 of your <58 who is in <840

13:2 <742 when ye <249 do your alms do not <3053 a trumpet
<37 you, as will hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets,
that they may have <29777 of men. <2396 I say unto you, they have <1423
reward.

13:3 But when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy <347
hand doeth;

13:4 That <264 alms may be in secret; and thy <87 who seeth in
<10015 <2554 <82 <98 thee openly.

13:5 And when thou prayest thou <299 not do as the hypocrites, for
they love to pray, <8362 in the <92 and in the corners of the
<96 that they may be seen of men. <95 I say unto you, they have
<96 <95

13:6 But <25493 when thou prayest, <685 into thy closet, and when thou
hast shut thy door, pray to thy <85 who is in <92 and thy
<1102 who <93 in <92 <91 <91 thee <91

13:7 But when ye <78 use not vain repetitions, as the heathen, for
they think that they <25 be <1041 for <68 much speaking.

13:8 Be not ye <1699 like unto <1773 for your <58 <28461 what
<314 ye have need of <217 ye ask him.

13:9 After this <1443 <26 pray ye: Our <24 who art in <643
hallowed be thy <4819

<21583 Thy will be done on <1390 as it is in <274

<21540 And forgive us our debts, as we <6 our debtors.

<21504 And lead us not into temptation, but <8100 us from <629

<21454 For <234 is the <7522 and the <8764 and the <27799 <22395
<2578

<21423 For, if ye <43 men <121 trespasses your heavenly <85 will
also <10 you;

<21379 But if ye <9 not men <20 <20 <745 will your
<22 <10 your trespasses.

<21376 Moreover, when ye fast be not as the <265 of a sad
countenance, for they disfigure <31 faces that they may <17004 unto
men to fast. <259 I say unto you, they have <18 <258

<21380 But <258 when thou fastest, anoint thy <773 and wash thy face;

<21358 That thou <37 not unto men to <27197 but unto thy <257 who
is in <266 and thy <8 who <265 in <265 <240 <265 thee
<266

<21330 Lay not up for <975 <20371 upon <838 <27828 moth and
rust doth <27836 and thieves <10826 <2819 and steal;

<21277 But lay up for <25 <25 in <233 <25 <136 moth
nor rust doth <26 and <9 <27 do not <29 <29 nor
steal.

<21228 For <14 your <22650 is, <2650 will your <1421 be <7071

<21173 The <1549 of the body is the eye; if, <11862 <226 eye be
single, thy <3208 body <97 be full of light.

<21124 But if <19 eye be <847 thy <18 body <18 be full of
<4192 If, <34 the <44 that is in thee be <6216 how
<1753 is that darkness!

<21126 No man can <10670 two masters; for either he will hate the one and
love the <29522 or else he will hold to the one and despise the other.
Ye <1685 <30 God and Mammon.

<21113 And now it came to pass that when <2235 had <2235 <967 <2079 he
<28171 upon the <2180 whom he had chosen, and said unto <3031 Remember
the <18 <765 I have <10763 For <984 ye are they whom I have
<2202 to <2199 unto this <1752 <754 I say unto you, take no
<3591 for your <4963 what ye <131 eat, or what ye <5 drink; nor
yet for your <12447 what ye <10 put on. Is not the life more than
meat, and the body than raiment?

<21169 <3736 the fowls of the air, for they sow not, <248 do they
reap nor <4724 into barns; yet your <414 <392 feedeth <2394 Are
ye not much <1278 than they?

<21118 Which of you by <3582 <83 can add one cubit unto his
stature?

<21054 And why take ye <17 for <66 Consider the lilies of the
<14020 how they grow; they toil not, <65 do they spin;

<21016 And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon, in all his <504 was
not arrayed like one of these.

<20985 Wherefore, if God so <21079 the grass of the field, <186 today
is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, even so will he <21 you, if
ye are not of <2621 <32846

<20997 <196 take no thought, <10336 What <173 we eat? or, What
<6 we drink? or, Wherewithal <5 we be clothed?

<20986 For your <153 <153 <676 that ye have need of all <271
<2690

<20942 But seek ye <1622 the <1764 of God and his <2230 and
all <21 <702 <42 be added unto you.

<20895 Take <697 no <159 for the <11558 for the <14036 <19
take <10 for the <26 of itself. Sufficient is the day unto the
evil <6228

3 <1025 <1025 14

14:1 And now it came to pass that when <353 had <353 <61 <335 he
<3925 <1422 to the <2555 and did open his <16412 unto them <2355
<2559 <1055 <1055 I say unto you, Judge not, that ye be not
judged.

14:2 For with what <1830 ye <9874 ye <84 be judged; and with what
measure ye mete, it <11 be measured to you <32323

14:3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but
considerest not the beam that is in <524 own eye?

14:4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me pull the mote out of
<23 eye—and <439 a beam is in <7 own eye?

14:5 Thou hypocrite, <197 cast the beam out of <15 own eye; and then
<1026 thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy <73 eye.

14:6 Give not that <304 is holy unto the dogs, <353 cast ye your
pearls <926 swine, lest they <23823 them <1271 <768 <3854 and turn
<176 and rend you.

14:7 Ask, and it <137 be <2122 unto you; seek, and ye <8 find;
knock, and it <6 be <30557 unto you.

14:8 For <7538 one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh,
findeth; and to him that knocketh, it <27 be opened.

14:9 Or what man is <721 of you, who, if his son ask bread, will give
him a stone?

<20547 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

<20510 If ye then, <4425 <718 know how to give good gifts unto your
<14032 how much more <64 your <389 who is in <1353 give good
<341 to them that ask him?

<20492 <1304 all <12 <1646 ye <1352 that men <1352 do to
you, do ye even so to <1104 for this is the law and the <2320

<20464 Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad
is the way, <209 <19171 to <26538 and many <128 be who go in
thereat;

<20468 <22789 <31 is the <28 and narrow is the way, <27 <27
unto <700 and few <28 be that find it.

<20474 Beware of <21782 <3969 who come to you in sheep’s clothing,
but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

<20448 Ye <135 know them by <260 fruits. Do men <689 grapes of
thorns, or figs of thistles?

<20413 Even so <239 good tree <19247 <3011 good fruit; but a corrupt
tree <9 <9 evil <25314

<20408 A good tree <851 <5794 <12 evil <25514 <320 a <21 tree
<9 <9 good <21

<20360 Every tree that <32 not <12 good <25354 is hewn down, and
cast into the <2246

<20344 <674 by <83 fruits ye <90 know <765

<20265 Not <75 one that <13916 unto me, <8496 <1 <16 <1378 into
the <613 of <1671 but he that <19873 the will of my <255 who is
in <1277

<20220 Many will say to me in that day: <35 <1 have we not
<4325 in thy <3331 and in thy name have cast out devils, and in
thy name done many wonderful works?

<20217 And then will I profess unto <947 I <7726 knew you; <10126 from
me, ye that work <15156

<20195 <309 <2059 heareth <629 <5836 of mine and <85 <300 I
will liken him unto a wise man, who <3314 his <5587 upon a rock—

<20207 And the rain descended, and the <3305 came, and the <3305 blew,
and beat upon that <2696 and it fell not, for it was founded upon a
rock.

<20215 And <161 one that <66 <66 <66 of mine and <66 them
not <166 be likened unto a <15072 man, who <66 his <66 upon the
sand—

<20215 And the rain <67 and the <67 <67 and the <67 <67
and beat upon that <67 and it fell, and <1158 was the fall of it.

3 <773 <773 15

15:1 And now it came to pass that when <773 had <8906 <78 <78 he
cast his eyes <4953 <5006 on the <776 and said unto <179 <2329
ye have <1577 the <476 <403 I <10100 <630 I <4201 to my <3683
<1230 <180 remembereth <36 <36 of mine and <114 <180 him
will I <8564 up at the last day.

15:2 And it came to pass that when <67 had said <31 <840 he
perceived that <446 were some <3369 them who marveled, and wondered
what he <536 <3994 the law of Moses; for they <4836 not the
<30441 that old <78 had <2825 <1955 and that all <7 had <1956
new.

15:3 And he said unto <105 Marvel not that I said unto you that old
<24 had <31 <31 and that all <7 had <31 new.

15:4 <130 I say unto you that the law is <5671 that was <737
unto <16750

15:5 <20 I am he that gave the law, and I am he who <11131 with
my <4361 Israel; <152 the law in me is <16727 for I have
come to fulfil the law; <1023 it hath an end.

15:6 <44 I do not <2957 the <577 for as many as have not
been <70 in me, <2865 I say unto you, <302 all be <2097

15:7 And <2366 I said unto you that old <111 have <118 <118 I do
not <43 that <236 hath been <1036 <177 <15 <6 are to
<4596

15:8 For <937 the <5969 <13 I have made with my <101 is not
all <16786 but the law <15 was <137 unto <6545 hath an end in
me.

15:9 <98 I am the law, and the <1533 Look unto me, and endure to
the end, and ye <94 live; for unto him that endureth to the end will
I give <6751 <6751

<19788 <39 I have <55 unto you the commandments; <154 keep my
<27412 And this is the law and the <151 for they <5485
<4997 of me.

<19773 And now it came to pass that when <323 had <127 <323 <3566
he said unto <2274 <1516 whom he had chosen:

<19740 Ye are my disciples; and ye are a <1609 unto this <3200 who are
a <5646 of the <484 of <5658

<19688 And <158 this is the land of your inheritance; and the <662
hath <96 it unto you.

<19669 And not at any time hath the <18 <16 me <13376 that I
<916 tell it unto your <7710 at <13488

<19673 <2611 at any time hath the <25 <25 me <25 that I
<25 tell unto them <234 the <2539 <9446 of the <78 of
<4945 whom the <23 hath led away out of the <7849

<19662 This much did the <16 <12846 me, that I <37 tell unto
<414

<19644 That <41 sheep I have <251 are not of this fold; them also I
must bring, and they <231 hear my <5483 and <490 <6 be one fold,
and one shepherd.

15:18 And now, <336 of stiffneckedness and <19651 they <491
not my <18623 <234 I was <3213 to say no more of the <74
<104 this <12707 unto <854

15:19 But, <1364 I say unto you that the <19 hath <28 me,
and I tell it unto you, that ye were separated from <558 them <58
of <893 <10821 <52 it is <8 of <7 <7697 that they
know not of you.

15:20 And <49 I say unto you <1257 that the <128 <169 hath the
<55 <42 from <2453 and it is <36 of <36 <36 that
they know not of <85

15:21 And <468 I say unto you, that ye are they of whom I <28021 Other
<170 I have <170 are not of this <170 them also I must <169 and
they <164 hear my <170 and <170 <6 be one <170 and one
<170

15:22 And they <164 me not, for they <13894 it had been the
Gentiles; for they <14 not that the Gentiles <237 be <9190
<2034 <90 preaching.

15:23 And they <18 me not that I said they <53 hear my <59
and they <14 me not that the <33 <33 not at any time
hear my voice—that I <10 not <5926 <31243 unto them save it were
by the Holy <3882

15:24 But <396 ye have both <813 my <5668 and seen me; and ye are
my sheep, and ye are <15295 <215 <454 whom the <180 hath <368
me.

3 <880 <880 16

16:1 And <210 <1 I say unto you that I have <211 <169 <167
are not of this <6502 <1178 of the land of <6681 <6 in any
<13370 of that land <895 <895 <8537 I have been to minister.

16:2 For they of whom I <24274 are they who have not as yet <94 my
<140 <37 have I at any time manifested <125 unto <250

16:3 But I have <4286 a <461 of the <100 that I <169 go
unto <918 and that they <8 hear my <132 and <5 be <123
<124 my <131 that <244 may be one fold and one <31908 <344
I go to show <53 unto <53

16:4 And I <474 you that ye <35 <15755 <616 <970 <3334 I am
gone, that if it so be that my <736 at <129 they who have seen
me and been with me in my <9280 do not ask the <87 in my <1235
that they may <3494 a <10871 of you by the Holy <4206 and also of
the <183 <394 whom they know not of, that <64 <64 <191 ye
<71 <71 <2 be kept and <4 be <146 unto the Gentiles,
that <318 the fulness of the <8 the <674 of <326 <31692
who <21 be <12121 <1377 upon the face of the <2607 <432 of
<17 <33184 may be <6315 in, or may be <5 to a <77 of
me, <16 <6659

16:5 And then will I <1474 them in from the four <12065 of the
<4050 and then will I <18312 the <881 <87 the <121 hath made
unto all the <148 of the <668 of Israel.

16:6 And <4157 are the <88 <71 of <54 belief in me, in
and of the Holy <139 <37 witnesses unto them of me and of the
Father.

16:7 <864 <29 of <29 <29 in me, <1458 the <2544 and
<11 of the <644 of you, O <59 of <726 in the <14964 day
<136 the <33272 come unto the <62 that the <156 of <179
<987 <14 be made <9139 unto <264

16:8 But wo, <46 the <46 unto the unbelieving of the Gentiles—for
<6192 they have come <173 upon the face of this <397 and
have <184 my <122 who are of the <65 of <1113 and my <10
who are of the <11 of <7063 have been cast out from <341 <355 and
have been <4186 <1919 feet by <648

16:9 And <107 of the mercies of the <175 unto the <95 and
also the <21047 of the <11 upon my <50 who are of the <49 of
<126 <488 <1 I say unto you, that <358 all <4825 and I have
<7861 my <25 who are of the <25 of <74 to be <23876 and to
be afflicted, and to be <9080 and to be cast out from <87 <87 and
to <1266 <21204 by <7 and to <6 a hiss and a byword <17 <6530

<19973 And thus <5160 the <81 that I <621 say unto you: At
that day when the <642 <190 sin <3924 my gospel, and <6
<33086 the <205 of my <9 and <9 be <11852 up in the <11941 of
<252 <5298 <8172 all nations, and <4 all the <100 of the <2684
<2783 and <25 be <4547 with all <3007 of lyings, and of deceits,
and of mischiefs, and all <12 of hypocrisy, and <17872 and
priestcrafts, and <13356 and of <8203 <10204 and if they
<35 do all <670 <3799 and <6 <74 the <74 of my <74
<702 <268 the <268 I will <1822 the <13 of my gospel from
<127 <289

<20058 And then will I <9831 my <399 <362 I have made unto my
<1148 O <187 of <211 and I will <36 my <33 unto <31

<20066 And I will show unto <3573 O <22 of <22 that the <153
<73 not have <4874 over you; but I will <50 my <50 unto
you, O <23 of <23 and ye <21 come unto the <494 of the
<86 of my gospel.

<20059 But if the <42 will <4318 and <7368 unto me, <111 the
<112 <3615 they <32 be <680 <107 my <89 O <44 of
<486

<20049 And I will not <3972 my <16 who are of the <19 of <63
to go <592 <30 <274 and tread them <1954 <45 the <484

<20046 But if they will not turn unto me, and <16278 unto my <740 I
will <43 <29 yea, I will <5 my <48 O <45 of <45 that
they <77 go <47 <47 <18 and <6 <48 them <48 and they
<7 be as salt that hath lost its savor, <190 is <4629 good
for <12389 but to be cast out, and to be <443 <443 foot of my
<51 O <51 of <114

<20081 <2532 <419 I say unto you, thus hath the <359 <1168
me—that I <361 give unto this <321 this land for <334 inheritance.

<20073 And then the <1741 of the <7090 Isaiah <75 be <1625
<70 say:

<20076 Thy watchmen <12 lift up the <900 with the <6621 <7409
<10 they sing, for they <5 see eye to eye when the Lord <8
<278 <1187 Zion.

<20050 Break <581 into joy, sing <6912 ye <17565 <7574 of
<19593 for the Lord hath comforted his <107 he hath <31134
<1406

<20055 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eye of all the
nations; and all the ends of the <797 <60 see the <13043 of God.

3 <1057 <1057 17

17:1 <715 now it came to pass that when <1547 had <1547 <688 <129
he <3063 <1040 <1040 <92 on the <1936 and he said unto <1418
<28 my time is at <18926

17:2 I perceive that ye are weak, that ye <2267 <6763 all my
<39 <160 I am <193 of the <197 to <1067 unto you at this
<13319

17:3 <2144 go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the <756 <30
I have <27793 and ask of the <371 in my <977 that ye may <20087
and <16156 your <10848 for the <2849 and I come unto you <2751

17:4 But now I go unto the <32 and also to show <1063 unto the
lost <996 of <339 for they are not lost unto the <20 for he
<2935 <1170 he hath <7085 <501

17:5 And it came to pass that when <156 had thus <5482 he cast his
eyes <157 <157 <157 on the <157 and <29202 they were in <14144
and did look <6925 upon him as if they <2036 ask him to tarry a
<3025 longer with <53

17:6 And he said unto <188 <187 my bowels are <661 with
compassion <6884 you.

17:7 Have ye any that are sick <432 you? Bring them hither. Have ye
any that are lame, or <30162 or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that
are withered, or that are deaf, or that are <18427 in any manner?
<35 them <26350 and I will heal <475 for I have <61 upon you;
my <71 are <71 with <5263

17:8 For I <260 that ye <4721 that I <439 show unto you what I
have done unto your <1769 at <1222 for I see that your <8375 is
sufficient that I <25 heal you.

17:9 And it came to pass that when he had thus <180 all the
<173 with one <6583 did go <424 with <485 sick and <3
<900 and <4 <121 and with <4 <123 and with <4 dumb,
and with all them that were <116 in any manner; and he did heal
them <2401 one as they were <1200 <42 unto him.

17:10 And they did all, both they who had been <10716 and they who were
whole, bow down at his <2948 and did <6629 him; and as many as <9743
come for the <6775 did kiss his <18 <7272 that they did bathe
his feet with <80 tears.

17:11 And it came to pass that he <412 that <15 <268 <4303
<143 be brought.

17:12 So they <84 <14 <14 <14 and set them down upon the
<8920 <321 <321 him, and <334 <6627 in the midst; and the <65
gave way till they had all been <32 unto him.

17:13 And it came to pass that when they had all been <30859 and
<37 <37 in the midst, he <74 the <38 that they <73
kneel down upon the ground.

17:14 And it came to pass that when they had knelt upon the <32343
<36 groaned <33945 himself, and <1794 <434 I am troubled <1177
of the <8985 of the <718 of the <746 of <746

17:15 And when he had said <592 <2139 he <4208 also <42 upon the
<1387 and <893 he prayed unto the <42 and the <541 <541 he
<10 <581 be <4637 and the <89 did bear <6158 who <1636
him.

17:16 And <1205 this <1074 do they bear record: The eye hath <2743
<9947 <1653 hath the ear <18759 before, so <2619 and <7606 <46
as we saw and <37 <104 <616 unto the <2574

17:17 And no tongue can speak, <31 can <1640 be <4584 by any man,
<9 can the <1160 of men conceive so <41 and <41 <41 as
we both saw and <42 <42 speak; and no one can <19 of the joy
<105 <439 our <31650 at the time we <20 him pray for us unto the
<980

17:18 And it came to pass that when <39 had made an end of praying
unto the <147 he arose; but so <65 was the joy of the <145
that they were overcome.

17:19 And it came to pass that <37 <6981 unto <517 and bade them
<6935

17:20 And they <6939 from the <1257 and he said unto <602 <6056 are
ye <240 of your <3646 And now <1222 my joy is full.

17:21 And when he had said <238 <238 he wept, and the <70 bare
<215 of it, and he took <373 <373 <3264 one by one, and
<1611 <69 and <241 unto the <812 for <667

17:22 And when he had done this he wept <8844

17:23 And he <98 unto the <544 and said unto <83 <3864 your
<46 ones.

17:24 And as they <897 to <300 they cast <61 eyes <696 <4124
and they saw the <9217 open, and they saw <9930 <7585 out of
<3332 as it were in the <7573 of <23539 and they came down and
<24484 <1358 <50 ones <7826 and they were <8 <465 with
<19 and the <35 did <3985 unto <98

17:25 And the <130 did see and hear and bear <14164 and they know
that <73 <141 is true for they all of them did see and <8822 <610
man for <23026 and they were in <6285 <53 two <16860 and five
<18857 souls; and they did consist of men, <17468 and <27702

3 <1041 <1041 18

18:1 And it came to pass that <254 <507 his disciples that they
<508 <1130 <657 some bread and wine unto him.

18:2 And <5377 they were gone for <15 and wine, he <29 the
<103 that they <29 sit <11988 down upon the <6100

18:3 And when the <47 had come with <28 and <28 he took of
the <8 and brake and <249 it; and he gave unto the <23 and
<46 that they <43 eat.

18:4 And when they had <13879 and were filled, he <18 that they
<19 give unto the multitude.

18:5 And when the <77 had <23 and were <23 he said unto the
disciples: <269 <479 <1188 one be <11351 <940 you, and to him
will I give <1511 that he <16 <4378 <80 and <5057 it and give it
unto the <611 of my church, unto all <253 who <20 <5821 and be
<6399 in my <4647

18:6 And this <15 ye <25542 <19744 to do, even as I have <12479 even
as I have <5833 <50 and <128 it and <2315 it unto you.

18:7 And this <32 ye do in <27906 of my <4248 <534 I have <8331
unto you. And it <17 be a <11422 unto the <407 that ye do <57
<1604 me. And if ye do <8 <7 me ye <22 have my <11574 to
be with you.

18:8 And it came to pass that when he said <474 <474 he <177
his <201 that they <179 take of the wine of the cup and drink of
it, and that they <16 also give unto the <188 that they <9783
<17 of it.

18:9 And it came to pass that they did so, and did <18 of it and were
filled; and they gave unto the <485 and they did drink, and they
were filled.

18:10 And when the <76 had done <1958 <354 said unto <505
<589 are ye for this <2734 <150 ye have <183 for this is
<8673 my <5973 and this doth <9243 unto the <152 that
ye are <13633 to do that <26 I have <123 you.

18:11 And this <156 ye <162 do to <249 who <1744 and are <247
in my <7375 and ye <17 do it in <212 of my <16672 <36 I have
shed for you, that ye may <58 unto the <58 that ye do <40

be with you.

18:12 And I give unto you a <2498 that ye <22 do <212 <4307
And if ye <8 <35 do <9 <828 <297 are ye, for ye are <3531
upon my <3562

18:13 But <3446 <380 you <24 do more or less than <27 are not
<23 upon my <6977 but are <6 upon a <6933 foundation; and when the
rain descends, and the <3556 <9908 and the <3556 blow, and beat upon
<731 they <41 fall, and the <6955 of hell are ready open to <2487
<641

18:14 <4433 <79 are ye if ye <24 keep my <203 <152
the <142 hath <190 me that I <295 give unto you.

18:16 And as I have <812 <125 you even so <62 ye pray in my
<488 <11 my <494 who do <240 and are <240 in my <487
<535 I am the light; I have set an example for you.

18:17 And it came to pass that when <326 had <1719 <167 <1680 unto
his disciples, he <4432 <1563 unto the <396 and said unto <341

18:18 <1535 <107 <1 I say unto you, ye must <108 and pray
<229 lest ye <3926 into temptation; for <13892 <7803 to have you,
that he may sift you as wheat.

18:19 <171 ye must <27 pray unto the <165 in my <334

18:20 And <4182 ye <121 ask the <14 in my <1717 <186 is
<18738 <22078 that ye <14 <9803 <907 it <4 be <581 unto
you.

18:21 Pray in your families unto the <1073 <50 in my <32 that
your wives and your <1365 may be blessed.

18:22 And <1032 ye <38 meet <1955 oft; and ye <6 not forbid
any man from <9097 unto you when ye <12 meet <1944 but <2093
them that they may come unto you and <24 them not;

18:23 But ye <23 pray for <309 and <5 not cast them out; and if
it so be that they come unto you oft ye <18 pray for them unto the
<93 in my <233

18:24 <1869 hold up your <3456 that it may <6660 unto the <8298
<249 I am the <13 <146 ye <35 hold up—that <5 ye have seen me
do. <17 ye see that I have <297 unto the <47 and ye all have
witnessed.

18:25 And ye see that I have <365 that none of you <366 go <3677
but <18892 have <12 that ye <10 come unto me, that ye <669
feel and see; even so <64 ye do unto the <8558 and <5964
breaketh this <513 suffereth <1431 to be led into temptation.

18:26 And now it came to pass that when <328 had <328 <328 <743
he <325 his eyes <327 upon the <671 whom he had <5113 and
said unto <332

18:27 <112 <331 <1 I say unto you, I give unto you <9036
<6328 and then I must go unto my <295 that I may <3835 <2972

<9 and <9 damnation to his soul; <3118 if ye know that a
man is unworthy to eat and <822 of my <28 and <28 ye <45 <305

18:30 <22482 ye <10 not cast him out from <522 you, but ye

<436 and if it so be that he <8282 and is <545 in my <404
then <27 ye <643 him, and <5 <37 unto him of my <68 and
<17425

18:31 But if he <576 not he <20 not be <2553 <66 my <2331
that he may not <3956 my <8 for <470 I know my <3246 and they
are numbered.

18:32 <100 ye <32 not cast him out of your synagogues, or
your <2378 of <19844 for unto such <17 ye <15991 to minister;
for ye know not but what they will <2624 and <7796 and come unto me
with full <6727 of <6727 and I <29 heal <2957 and ye <5 be the

more come into thee the <35450 and the unclean.

20:37 Shake thyself from the dust; <28681 sit <5737 O <120 <34382
<11 from the <40264 of thy neck, O <3891 daughter of <5635

20:38 For thus <269 the <26635 Ye have sold <8782 for naught, and
ye <58 be <144 <1727 money.

20:39 <3947 <1139 I say unto you, that my <404 <18 know my
<3370 yea, in that day they <10 know that I am he that doth speak.

20:40 And then <15 they say: How <116 upon the <21739 are the
feet of him that <7839 good <24026 unto <823 that publisheth
<32992 that <10 good <10 unto them of <27601 that <12
salvation; that <92 unto Zion: Thy God reigneth!

20:41 And then <49 a cry go forth: Depart ye, <7765 ye, go ye out
from thence, touch not that <196 is unclean; go ye out of the <787 of
her; be ye clean that bear the vessels of the <17900

20:42 For ye <46 not go out with haste nor go by flight; for the Lord
will go <1294 you, and the God of <6285 <23 be your rearward.

20:43 <831 my servant <11 deal prudently; he <4 be exalted and
extolled and be very high.

20:44 As many were <23863 at thee—his visage was so marred, more
than any man, and his form more than the sons of <27884

20:45 So <43 he sprinkle many <344 the kings <7 shut <400
mouths at him, for that <125 had not been told them <15 they see;
and that <12 they had not <1762 <11 they consider.

20:46 <250 <250 I say unto you, all <2005 <895 <16 <18821
<4265 even as the <378 hath <1308 me. Then <12 this <621
<37 the <11 hath <615 with his <274 be <7511 and then
<17 <475 be <14537 <607 with my <450 and it <10 be the
land of <85 <485

3 <1817 <1817 21

21:1 And <7138 I say unto you, I give unto you a <28435 that ye may
know the time when <80 <80 <41 be <2772 to take place—that I
<8 <543 in, from <47 long dispersion, my <60 O <769 of
<5815 and <15 <1088 <72 <973 them my <450

21:2 And <943 this is the <4557 <104 I will give unto you for a
sign—for <71 I say unto you that when <59 <59 <19 I <11312

21:4 For it is <27147 in the <237 that they <1553 be <16859 in
this <1245 and be set up as a free <69 by the <116 of the <39
that <60 <60 <3372 come <49 from them unto a <98 of your

<226 you <182 <7 come <52 from the <1031 unto your seed
<18 <11 <27511 in <6898 <1097 of <7487

21:6 For thus it <28960 the <62 that it <107 come <30 from
the <31 that he may show <9 his <103 unto the <10 for
this <3320 that the <7 if they will not <1027 <302 <19901
that they may <1435 and come unto me and be <3135 in my name and
know of the true <12098 of my <11645 that they may be <3996 <94
my <118 O <118 of <118

21:7 And when <118 <159 come to pass that thy seed <102 <36175 to

the work of the <109 hath <10569 <21306 unto the <1454 of
the <184 <137 he hath made unto the <216 who are of the <62 of

21:8 And when that day <50 <503 it <3 come to pass that <556
<7 shut <123 mouths; for that <39 had not been told them <12
they see; and that <12 they had not <554 <11 they <554

21:9 For in that day, for my sake <14 the <83 work a work, <25

Yet I will heal him, for I will show unto them that my <385 is

21:14 Yea, wo be unto the <635 <1853 they <15673 for it <19
come to pass in that day, <1017 the <553 that I will cut off thy
<19457 out of the <98 of <7033 and I will <4411 thy chariots;

21:15 And I will cut off the <14514 of thy <601 and throw down all thy
strongholds;

21:16 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy <21 and thou <1989

21:17 Thy graven images I will also cut off, and thy <10334 <9

thy <22838

21:18 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the <29 of thee; so will
I <102 thy cities.

21:19 And it <139 come to pass that all <7252 and deceivings, and
<31099 and <31100 and <7244 and <7244 <18 be done
<10731

21:20 For it <11 come to <2048 <164 the <164 that at that day
<343 will not <604 and come unto my <13556 Son, them will I cut
off from <256 my <591 O <529 of <591

21:21 And I will execute vengeance and fury upon <577 even as upon the

21:22 But if they will <54 and <7131 unto my <398 and <672 not

come in unto the <604 and be <663 <14 this the <359 of
<898 unto whom I have <933 this land for <36 <8440

21:23 And they <33 assist my <95 the <25 of <24 and also
as many of the <105 of <1237 as <19 <626 that they may <17891 a
<1469 <470 <10 be <11931 the New <1555

21:24 And then <12 they <42 my <428 that they may be <2505
in, who are <960 upon all the face of the <288 in unto the New
<34

21:25 And then <34 the <501 of <2145 come down <105 <626 and I
also will be in the midst.

21:26 And then <24 the work of the <544 commence at that day, even
when this <1750 <15 be <1750 <35 the <114 of this <2099
<2096 I say unto you, at that day <18 the work of the <33
<34 <23 all the <14653 of my <143 yea, even the <6978
<124 have been lost, <4 the <21 hath led away out of <96

21:27 Yea, the work <40 <34 <34 all the <34 of my
<35 with the <26 to <7046 the way <38874 they may come unto
me, that they may call on the <18 in my <1808

21:28 Yea, and then <41 the work commence, with the <17 <46 all
<2355 in preparing the way <39 his <185 may be <183 home to
the land of <248 <1307

21:29 And they <35 go out from all <1410 and they <8 not go out
in haste, nor go by flight, for I will go <1497 <308 <392 the
<393 and I will be <41 <1498

3 <1348 <1348 22

22:1 And then <40 that <142 is <3343 come to pass: Sing, O barren,
thou that <34985 not bear; <1856 <731 into <21315 and cry aloud, thou
that <13 not travail with child; for more are the <2187 of the
<14924 than the <7 of the married <11449 <71 the <1595

22:2 Enlarge the <4547 of thy tent, and let them stretch <47 the
curtains of thy habitations; <22202 not, <33278 thy cords and
strengthen thy stakes;

22:3 For thou <576 <72 <25 on the <10975 hand and on the left, and
thy seed <103 <12374 the <699 and make the <70 <657 to be
inhabited.

22:4 Fear not, for thou <36 not be ashamed; <3136 be thou
confounded, for thou <11 not be put to shame; for thou <8 <25507
the shame of thy youth, and <9 not <2171 the reproach of thy
<10 and <10 not <10 the <10 of thy widowhood any more.

22:5 For thy maker, thy husband, the Lord of Hosts is his <1841 and thy
<20312 the Holy One of Israel—the God of the <2684 <1991 <99 he be
called.

22:6 For the Lord hath <480 thee as a woman <40353 and <18090 in
<15553 and a wife of <70 when thou wast refused, <187 thy God.

22:7 For a <14341 moment have I <28 <740 but with <1097 <8103
will I <1576 <35691

22:8 In a <3630 <38565 I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with
<20870 kindness will I have <15871 on <37 <52 the Lord thy
<8343

22:9 For <6155 the <16359 of Noah unto me, for as I have sworn that the
<13 of Noah <1359 no more go over the <3075 so have I <17 that I
<2316 not be wroth with <77

22:10 For the <1968 <141 <1921 and the <16326 be removed, but my
<73 <11 not <12 from <72 <231 <6 the <685 of my
<16228 be <19 <82 the Lord that hath <90 on <41

22:11 O thou <7276 tossed with <17087 and not comforted! <1897
I will lay thy <28246 with fair colors, and lay thy <33646 with
sapphires.

22:12 And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy <6076 of
carbuncles, and all thy <22534 of <43652 stones.

22:13 And all thy <396 <80 be <9600 of the <18056 and <195 <8
be the <86 of thy <6683

22:14 In <18341 <300 thou be established; thou <5 be far
from oppression for thou <8 not <37352 and from <22793 for it <35
not come near <112

22:15 <103 they <12 <1903 <240 <2358 <2538 <142 not by
me; <912 <11 <10 <10 <10 thee <5 fall for thy
sake.

22:16 <28 I have <16074 the smith that bloweth the coals in the
<15074 and that <2145 <448 an instrument for his work; and I have
<24 the waster to destroy.

22:17 No weapon that is <20396 <53 thee <53 prosper; and <2732
<3920 that <7 <12727 <11 thee in <10492 thou <103 condemn.
This is the heritage of the <27818 of the <3083 and <607
<133 is of me, <229 the <550

3 <614 <614 23

23:1 And now, <1425 I say unto you, that ye <37757 to <3436 <1579
<6355 Yea, a <3496 I give unto you that ye <13 <13 <1605
diligently; for <195 are the <3475 of Isaiah.

23:2 For <157 he <3493 as touching all <21 <1868 my <728
<662 are of the <949 of <1054 <1471 it must <21739 be that he
must <4029 also to the <3108

23:3 And all <32 that he <39 have been and <127 be, even
<13825 to the <60 <42 he spake.

23:4 <1470 give heed to my <32371 <8826 the <30 <16 I have
told you; and <27 to the time and the will of the <815 they
<43 go <205 unto the <62

23:5 And <247 will <1102 unto my <52 and <5775 and is
<13109 the same <25 be <15969 Search the <9587 for many <1611
be that <13159 of <143 <155

23:6 And now it came to pass that when <1534 had said <17 <41 he
said unto them <2560 <2947 he had expounded all the <15511 unto
them <93 they had received, he said unto <3695 <302 <5973
<15 I <498 that ye <515 write, that ye have not.

23:7 And it came to pass that he said unto <36080 <7836 <109 the
<5499 <41 ye have kept.

23:8 And when <261 had <2634 <17 the <25867 and laid them <900
him, he cast his eyes upon them and <4784

23:9 <1062 I say unto you, I <2295 my <1704 <18113 the
<18114 that he <74 <128 unto this <1024 that at the day that
the <179 <13 <12875 his name in me that <151 were many <16626
who <13 <4052 from the <5383 and <6 <11462 unto <5453 and <5
<5007 unto <1732 And he said unto <129 Was it not so?

23:10 And his <4043 <38600 him and <81 Yea, <378 <3226 did
<28762 <244 to thy <1321 and they were all <9928

23:11 And <193 said unto <39 How be it that ye have not <994 this
thing, that many <76 did <74 and <70 unto many and did <69
unto them?

23:12 And it came to pass that <161 <14737 that this <2320 had not
been <31631

23:13 And it came to pass that <60 <152 that it <109 be
<40502 <384 it was <60 <86 as he commanded.

23:14 And now it came to pass that when <28 had <269 all the
<255 in one, <228 they had <3908 he <41 them that they
<43 <5445 the <376 <14 he had <24 unto <157

3 <81 <503 24

24:1 And it came to pass that he <33 them that they <32 <408
the <332 <33 the <216 had <1443 unto Malachi, <7 he <14 tell
unto <41 And it came to pass that <346 they were <96 he
<56 <14 And <363 are the <33 <26 he did tell unto <1193
<3296 Thus said the <42 unto Malachi—Behold, I will send my
messenger, and he <420 <1297 the way <315 me, and the Lord whom ye
seek <13 suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the
<22139 whom ye delight in; <602 he <19 <1495 <622 the Lord of
<32210

24:2 But who may abide the day of his <31325 and who <23 <4360 when
he appeareth? For he is like a refiner’s <719 and like fuller’s soap.

24:3 And he <23 sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he <11
purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and <21256 that they
may <16648 unto the Lord an offering in <20074

24:4 Then <31 the <10 of Judah and <2690 be <884 unto
the <350 as in the days of old, and as in former <20684

24:5 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift
<5430 <778 the sorcerers, and <4 the adulterers, and <4
<10906 swearers, and <5 <2196 that oppress the hireling in his
wages, the widow and the fatherless, and that turn <42146 the stranger,
and fear not me, <170 the Lord of <169

24:6 For I am the <85 I <15600 not; <352 ye sons of <2084 are
not consumed.

24:7 Even from the days of your <3402 ye are gone away from mine
ordinances, and have not kept <281 Return unto me and I will <3481
unto you, <60 the Lord of <60 But ye say: Wherein <153 we return?

24:8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say: <21
have we <9 <36354 In tithes and <16851

24:9 Ye are <32577 with a curse, for ye have <19 me, even this <1306
nation.

24:10 <662 ye all the <31 into the storehouse, that <597 may be
meat in my <10745 and <27319 me now herewith, <85 the Lord of <33413
if I will not open you the <1132 of <5635 and pour you out a
<3654 that <37 <101 not be room enough to <6571 it.

24:11 And I will <38893 the devourer for your sakes, and he <23 not
<2043 the <11024 of your ground; <1233 <10 your vine cast her
<11052 <410 the time in the <35304 <71 the Lord of <156

24:12 And all <1690 <25 call you blessed, for ye <6 be a
delightsome <1863 <24 the Lord of <24

24:13 Your <477 have been stout <280 me, <16 the <1048 Yet ye
say: What have we <5072 <13 <174

24:14 Ye have <699 It is vain to <11998 God, and what doth it profit
that we have kept his ordinances and that we have walked mournfully
<91 the Lord of Hosts?

24:15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work <8383
are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.

24:16 Then they that <37986 the Lord <1040 often one to <15601 and
the Lord <33354 and <15712 and a book of <7537 was <598
<63 him for them that <28 the <358 and that <11757 upon his
<1859

24:17 And they <151 be mine, <132 the Lord of <243 in that day when
I make up my jewels; and I will <1724 them as a man spareth his own son
that serveth him.

24:18 Then <39 ye <370 and discern <24940 the <16502 and the
<22702 <7 him that <22 God and him that <5 him not.

3 <733 <733 25

25:1 For <633 the day <13132 that <40 burn as an oven; and all the
proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, <16 be stubble; and the day
that <26 <9 burn them up, <105 the Lord of <105 that it <11
leave them <302 root nor branch.

25:2 But unto you that fear my <6918 <19 the Son of Righteousness
<909 with healing in his wings; and ye <14 go <1056 and grow up as
calves in the stall.

25:3 And ye <18 <9392 down the <20360 for they <7 be ashes <6822
the soles of your feet in the day that I <15 do <1667 <83 the Lord
of <337

25:4 <12269 ye the law of <40908 my servant, <820 I <864 unto
him in Horeb for all <3301 with the <30887 and judgments.

25:5 <1181 I will send you Elijah the <4293 <258 the <7397 of
the <1376 and <16800 day of the <1579

25:6 And he <68 turn the <12464 of the <611 to the <8439 and
the <10 of the <1608 to <1457 <4256 lest I come and <13288 the
<1857 with a curse.

3 <225 <225 26

26:1 And now it came to pass that when <1006 had told <924 <988 he
<931 them unto the <5097 and he did <39534 all <13 unto
<932 both <85 and small.

26:2 And he saith: <39925 <16671 <131 ye had not with you, the
<948 <138 that I <987 give unto you; for it was <2905 in him
that they <13 be <1007 unto future generations.

26:3 And he did <57 all <9817 even from the <17567 <6926 the
time that he <26 come in his glory—yea, even all <75 <59 <9
come upon the face of the <1861 even <25 the elements <13 melt
with fervent heat, and the <138 <9 be wrapt <1692 as a scroll,
and the <8538 and the <14 <14 pass <19452

26:4 And even unto the <119 and last day, when all <1319 and all
kindreds, and all <618 and tongues <207 <997 <228 God, to be
<21135 of <198 <26348 <39892 they be good or <5 they be evil—

26:5 If they be <3867 to the <21420 of <1991 <35053 and if
they be <11950 to the <12 of damnation; <11957 on a parallel,
the one on the one hand and the <1472 on the <3 <26497 <1242 to
the mercy, and the <21044 and the <23716 <138 is in <3054 who
was <79 the <17583 began.

26:6 And now <770 <5611 be <580 in this book even a <23113 part
of the <170 <32 <264 did <5345 <1253 unto the <4358

26:7 But <5744 the <16745 of <295 do <23107 the more part of the
<27 <27 he <1931 the <2549

26:8 And <297 <12 have I <1298 <15 are a <30090 part of the
<12 <9 he <24 the <48 and I have <71 them to the
<28303 that they may be <1545 <3717 unto this <189 from the
<3088 <121 to the <785 <31 <82 hath <12715

26:9 And when they <199 have <4492 <475 <15 is <7257 that
they <236 have <4625 to try <205 <5911 and if it <20 so be that
they <6 <3211 <84 <72 then <5 the <3238 <5 be made
<10846 unto <1038

26:10 And if it so be that they will not <27 <27 <338 then
<28 the <28 <28 be withheld from <402 unto <53
<31809

26:11 <508 I was <3841 to <1390 <15 all <79 were <23226 upon
the <167 of <15068 but the Lord forbade it, <1363 I will try the
<5780 of my <168

26:12 <1835 I, <22930 do <35 the <55 <35 have been
<435 me of the <915 And now I, <17 make an end of my <7356
and <22975 to <26 the <26 <26 have been <25 me.

26:13 <3678 I <1764 that ye <148 <239 that the Lord <253 did
<255 the <188 for the <17714 of <17430 days; and <1462 that he did
show <6175 unto them oft, and did <2536 <5599 oft, and <4799 it, and
give it unto <159

26:14 And it came to pass that he did <46 and <1638 unto the
<608 of the <5587 of whom hath been <4909 and he did <4375
<164 tongues, and they did <1994 unto <7 <640 <456 and
<3523 <189 even <186 than he had revealed unto the <292
and he <38779 <20 <460 that they <5928 utter.

26:15 And it came to pass that <99 he had <7330 into heaven—the
<20220 time that he <31761 <105 unto <208 and had gone unto the
<2753 <22 <4917 <9578 all <42 sick, and <3 <9632 and <12492
the eyes of <8 <28003 and unstopped the ears of the <9751 and even
had done all <9374 of cures <2843 <42 and <4951 a man from the
<1841 and had <8771 <855 his <3001 unto <16 and had <72 unto
the Father—

26:16 <284 it came to pass on the <7296 that the <148 <2870
<8981 <4645 and they both saw and <3687 <325 children; yea,
even babes did open <76 <4272 and <27044 <148 <21945 and the
<254 <254 they did <10 were <44506 that <513 <248 not any
man <270 <213

26:17 And it came to pass that the <1899 whom <436 had <6728
<6819 from that time <91 to <15310 and to <227 as many as did come
unto <3097 and as many as were <3891 in the name of <32 were
<5817 with the Holy <7617

26:18 And many of them saw and <97 <46200 <233 <81 are not
lawful to be <1887

26:19 And they taught, and did <282 one to <15942 and they had
all <108 common <177 <161 <2379 man dealing justly, one with
<15982

26:20 And it came to pass that they did do all <26 even as <76 had
<390 <126

26:21 And they who were <94 in the name of <18 were <2776 the
<3328 of <20825

3 <640 <935 27

27:1 And it came to pass that as the <155 of <29 were journeying
and were <22211 the <58 <111 they had both <118 and <9633 and
were <28873 in the name of <5919 it came to pass that the <33
were <245 <853 and were <21077 in <5147 prayer and fasting.

27:2 And <49 <654 <346 <346 unto <127 for they were <6330
unto the <957 in his <2896 and <18 came and <6195 in the <3555 of
<22 and said unto <2108 What will ye that I <608 give unto you?

27:3 And they said unto him: <1356 we will that thou wouldst tell us
the name <3196 we <26 call this <37702 for <293 are <7968
<195 the <2479 <2482 this matter.

27:4 And the Lord said unto <56 <4349 <4349 I say unto you, why
is it that the <26 <325 murmur and <41752 <3960 of this thing?

27:5 Have they not read the <1071 <159 say ye must take upon you
the name of <882 <12 is my name? For by this name <76 ye be
<219 at the last day;

27:6 And <8317 taketh upon him my <1317 and <12077 to the end, the
same <28 be saved at the last day.

27:7 <655 <5549 ye <14 do, ye <3 do it in my <173
<1851 ye <9 call the <269 in my <10 and ye <9 call upon
the <194 in my name that he will <652 the <20 for my <2770

27:8 And how be it my <13 save it be <90 in my <102 For if a
<12 be <10 in Moses’ name then it be <5 <185 or if it be
<14 in the name of a man then it be the <27 of a man; but if it
be <20 in my name then it is my <8919 if it so be that they are
<9045 upon my <10919

27:9 <2479 I say unto you, that ye are <16 upon my gospel; <123
ye <115 call <140 <361 ye do call, in my <127 <13 if ye
call upon the <668 for the <52 if it be in my name the <138
will hear you;

27:10 And if it so be that the <93 is <53 upon my <3616 then will
the <26 show <569 his own <3926 in it.

27:11 But if it be not <25 upon my <5506 and is <6 upon the
<22 of men, or upon the <6 of the <9069 <4753 I say unto you
they have joy in <660 <15 for a season, and by and by the end
<5437 and they are hewn down and cast into the <2254 from <17498
<376 is no return.

27:12 For <35 <35 do <5775 <430 for it is <356 of <10 <10
that they are hewn down; <144 <3375 the <154 that I have told
you.

27:13 <6424 I have <1413 unto you my <101 and this is the <131
<368 I have <14 unto you—that I came into the <1255 to do the will
of my <183 <57 my <149 sent me.

27:14 And my <9 sent me that I <4726 be <4219 up upon the cross;
and <876 that I had been <12 up upon the <15072 that I <21 draw
all men unto me, that as I have been <19 up by men even so <472
men be <10 up by the <64 to <1411 <1332 me, to be <1410 of
<128 <1411 <1406 they be good or <5 they be <1411

27:15 And for this <4410 have I been <36 up; <12680 <1261 to
the <905 of the <94 I will draw all men unto me, that they may be
<48 <21 to <48 <36565

27:16 And it <330 come to <4133 that <499 <2961 and is <739
in my name <14 be <9613 and if he <507 to the end, <1889 him
will I hold guiltless <94 my <57 at that day when I <25 <104
to <22375 the <7617

27:17 And he that <33 not unto the end, the same is he that is
also hewn down and cast into the <279 from <279 they can no more
return, <210 of the <6252 of the <5755

27:18 And this is the word <245 he hath <245 unto the <1162 of
men. And for this <148 he <5962 the <1403 <18 he hath <24923
and he <42059 not, but <13 all his <7675

27:19 And no <21558 <2819 can <9343 into his kingdom; <318
<7462 entereth into his rest save it be <2501 who have washed <164
<7495 in my <9659 <81 of <8 <1426 and the <21330 of all
<8 <15746 and <3 faithfulness unto the end.

27:20 Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the <1726
and come unto me and be <194 in my <695 that ye may be sanctified
by the reception of the Holy <11921 that ye may <183 spotless <194
me at the last day.

27:21 <795 <795 I say unto you, this is my <579 and ye know
the <424 that ye must do in my <654 for the <444 <147 ye have
seen me do that <231 ye also do; for that <14 ye have seen me do
even that <15 ye do;

27:22 <761 if ye do <1193 <46 <6150 are ye, for ye <18 be
<340 up at the last day.

27:23 Write the <21 <43 ye have seen and <10633 save it be <176
<11 are forbidden.

27:24 <21 the <78 of this <1451 <13 <41 be, even as hath been
<1680 of that <11 hath <17150

27:25 For <338 out of the books <13 have been <19 and <5
<30 be <6 <3 this <926 be judged, for by them <8 <211
<49 be <5285 unto men.

27:26 And <36 all <82 are <1713 by the <5901 <264 out
of the <45 <40 <28 be <13 <3 the <556 be <14058

27:27 And know ye that ye <14 be <22972 of this <93 <446 to
the <3578 <29 I <13 give unto you, <6 <5 be just.
<160 what <1404 of men <3550 ye to be? <806 I say unto you,
even as I am.

27:28 And now I go unto the <394 And <722 I say unto you,
<817 <90 ye <44 ask the <462 in my name <7 be <401
unto you.

27:29 <57 ask, and ye <14 <19802 <13982 and it <5 be
<1491 unto you; for he that <13978 <13978 and unto him that
<13973 it <18 be <13973

27:30 And now, <147 my joy is <21106 even unto <37149 <391 of
you, and also this <35422 yea, and even the <70 rejoiceth, and
also all the holy <22199 <21 of you and this <19 for none
of them are lost.

27:31 <1509 I <1715 that ye <670 <18874 for I mean them who
are now <19056 of this <30 and none of them are lost; and in
them I have <6273 of joy.

27:32 But <85 it sorroweth me <60 of the <18709 <36571 from
this generation, for they are led away <6060 by him even as was the
son of perdition; for they will sell me for silver and for <24354 and
for that <226 moth doth <13861 and <5 <14843 can <1770 <5032
and <14842 And in that day will I <17215 <883 even in <6577 <311
<311 upon <4 own heads.

27:33 And it came to pass that when <1344 had <13615 <422 <9315 he
said unto his <10528 <14048 ye in at the <14017 <14048 for <3 is
the <14021 and <14021 is the way that leads to <14020 and few <953 be
that find it; but wide is the <22 and <14071 the way <87 <21 to
<23401 and many <22 be that travel therein, <2306 the <9026 <997
<15955 no man can work.

3 <1504 <1504 28

28:1 And it came to pass when <89 had said <89 <3546 he <2790 unto
his <7537 one by one, <6737 unto <1380 What is it that ye <11495
of me, <934 that I am gone to the Father?

28:2 And they all <6890 save it were three, <2030 We <26 that
<25 we have lived unto the age of man, that our <12728 <85
thou hast <1241 us, may have an end, that we may speedily come unto
thee in thy kingdom.

28:3 And he said unto <76 <10462 are ye <266 ye <8844 this
<769 of me; <940 <54 that ye are <39133 and two <23027 old ye
<384 come unto me in my <785 and with me ye <11 find rest.

28:4 And when he had <3000 unto <251 he <8229 <1591 unto the
<102 and said unto <59 What will ye that I <365 do unto you, when
I am gone unto the <135

28:5 And they sorrowed in <280 <5035 for they <18570 not <2027 unto
him the <502 <228 they <39872

28:6 And he said unto <49 <414 I know your thoughts, and ye have
<112 the <111 <24 John, my beloved, who was with me in my
<162 <804 that I was <727 up by the Jews, <24 of me.

28:7 <536 more <749 are ye, for ye <121 <7712 taste of <19366
but ye <8 live to <2181 all the doings of the <504 unto the
<970 of men, even <300 all <87 <20 be <5901 <647 to
the will of the <1156 when I <13 come in my <7691 with the <7178
of <9454

28:8 And ye <17 <58 <13689 the pains of <60 but when I <10
come in my <28 ye <7 be changed in the twinkling of an eye from
mortality to immortality; and then <16 ye be <99 in the <14276
of my <672

28:9 And <4069 ye <18 not have pain <8928 ye <6 <19856 in the
flesh, <2993 <30365 save it be for the sins of the <10125 and all
this will I do <291 of the <178 <178 ye have <160 of me, for ye
have <7 that ye <1300 <5638 the <11451 of men unto me, <51 the
<801 <53 stand.

28:10 And for this <1119 ye <11 have <611 of joy; and ye <7 sit
down in the <95 of my <842 yea, your joy <13 be full, even as
the <189 hath <759 me <29 of joy; and ye <16 be even as I am,
and I am even as the <33 and the <25 and I are one;

28:11 And the Holy <6254 <17942 <4156 of the <17 and me; and the
<6 <17008 the Holy <15 unto the <240 of men, <125 of me.

28:12 And it came to pass that when <526 had <390 <526 <526 he
<9739 <2106 one of them with his finger save it were the <2453 who
were to tarry, and then he departed.

28:13 And <734 the <2873 were <34584 and they were caught up into
<3540 and saw and <2063 <2181 <4315

28:14 And it was <2264 them that they <433 utter; <223 was it
<140 unto them <1430 that they <2420 <2283 the <330 <215 they saw
and <3384

28:15 And <1470 they were in the body or out of the <11141 they <27
not tell; for it did seem unto them like a transfiguration of <503
that they were <323 from this body of <10167 into an immortal <46127
that they <32 <403 the <59 of God.

28:16 But it came to pass that they did <2129 <2265 upon the face of
the <8758 <8789 they did not <12 of the <31 <90 they
had <124 and <2187 <191 of the <4595 <11 was <113 them in
<414

28:17 And now, <103 they were mortal or immortal, from the day of
<554 transfiguration, I know not;

28:18 But this much I <42735 <466 to the <255 <42 hath been
given—they did go <1834 upon the face of the <3651 and did <73
unto all the <1139 uniting as many to the <1866 as <989 <2806 in
<51 preaching; <2265 <142 and as many as were <1392 did
<3746 the Holy <2413

28:19 And they were cast into <16886 by them who did not <25347 to the
church. And the prisons <160 not hold <39 for they were rent in
<16528

28:20 And they were cast down into the <156 but they did <3310 the
<3158 with the word of God, <9898 that by his <261 they were
<24719 out of the <17737 of the <28 and <1271 they <54 not
dig pits <12328 to hold <2426

28:21 And thrice they were cast into a furnace and <2976 no harm.

28:22 And twice were they cast into a den of wild beasts; and <254
they did play with the <6096 as a child with a suckling lamb, and
<36 no <36

28:23 And it came to pass that thus they did go <194 <2330 all the
<1380 of <2947 and did <22955 the <1916 of <19181 unto all <12
upon the face of the <21344 and they were <13910 unto the <2382 and
were <2447 unto the <212 of <2311 and thus the <27 of that
<1164 were <3897 <256 to the word of <8904

28:24 And now I, <2965 make an end of speaking <2396 <492
<328 for a <12735

28:25 <830 I was <3037 to <2706 the <9964 of <1516 who were <736 to
<796 of <1083 but the Lord forbade; <180 I <19 them not, for
they are hid from the <1824

28:26 But <511 I have seen <251 and they have <9628 unto me.

28:27 And <171 they will be <140 the <3190 and the <5508
<635 know them not.

28:28 They will also be <19 the <879 and the Jews <18 know them
not.

28:29 And it <11 come to <1931 when the Lord <16157 fit in his <3522
that they <15 <378 unto all the <5906 <5812 of <3674 and
unto all <13386 <3442 <2978 and <389 and <19 <757 out of
them unto <642 many souls, that <390 <1125 may be <13061 and
also <477 of the convincing <324 of God <438 is in <307

28:30 And they are as the <9765 of God, and if they <45 pray unto
the <709 in the name of <48 they can show <2929 unto
<1538 man it <30077 them <16813

28:31 <992 <3074 and <2925 <1342 <32 be <6836 by <167
<1019 the <12 and <3752 day when all <258 must <5119 <1836
<13 the judgment-seat of <24929

28:32 Yea even <158 the <174 <33 <1304 be a <29 and <41
work <40 by <40 <26 that <1649 day.

28:33 And if ye had all the <4734 <111 give an <20096 of all the
<29 <70 of <319 ye <48469 <311 to the <2005 of <8
know that <300 <299 must <70 <14757

28:34 And wo be unto him that will not <5102 unto the <26 of <2819
and also to them whom he hath <3005 and sent <87 <2990 for <2157
receiveth not the <22 of <149 and the <5 of <330 whom he hath
sent <16 not him; and <327 he will not <590 them at the
last day;

28:35 And it <619 be <16108 for them if they had not been <36331 For do
ye <27878 that ye can get rid of the <2140 of an offended God, who
hath been trampled <3997 feet of men, that <35942 <7740 <1033
<44844

28:36 And now <375 as I <1443 <430 <81 whom the Lord hath
<9501 yea, even <915 who were <895 up into the heavens, that I
knew not <753 they were <23273 from <1144 to immortality—

28:37 But <40 <24397 I wrote, I have <43579 of the <514 and he
hath made it <3545 unto me that <234 must <5352 be a <4624 <232
upon <343 bodies, or else it <12 be that they must <479 of <1215

28:38 <299 that they <98 not <12 of <23745 <34 was a <32
<33 upon <32 <32 that they <16 not <11191 pain nor <1186
save it were for the sins of the <501

28:39 Now this <30 was not equal to that <281 <309 take <6043 at
the last day; but <49 was a <19 <48 upon <313 <740 that
<11604 <725 have no <419 over <10 that he <8 not <4409 <255 and
they were <2209 in the <1251 that they were holy, and that the
<1332 of the <781 <24 not hold <445 3 <1650 28:40 And in this
<25448 they were to <26068 <1375 the <365 day of <392 and at that
day they were to <278 a <3498 change, and to be <736 into the
<1233 of the <465 to go no more out, but to <1320 eternally in the
heavens.

3 <57 <1707 29

29:1 And now <217 I say unto you that when the Lord <132 see fit,
in his <33728 that <399 <1806 <10 come unto the <456
<416 to his <42040 then ye may know that the <5894 <160 the
<66 hath made with the <1238 of <599 <300 <204
<34806 to the <26228 of <7 <8250 is <7214 <4121 to
be <5303

29:2 And ye may know that the <409 of the <285 <42 have been <1256
by the holy <5536 <68 all be <7694 and ye need not say that
the Lord delays his <557 unto the <61 of <7240

29:3 And ye need not <33520 in your <8380 that the <48 <45 have

<33971 the <91 did come upon us and did <34921 us out of
the <38506

2:5 And they did also <15 us <162 out of the land of David.

2:6 And we marched <14 and came to the land of Joshua, <632 was in
the <694 west by the seashore.

2:7 And it came to pass that we did <9867 in our <244 as fast as it
were possible, that we <1178 get them <705 in one <33123

2:8 But <968 the land was <3600 with <1377 and with <227

the <334 and also on the part of the <51 and it was one
complete revolution <30 all the face of the <2611

2:9 And now, the <175 had a king, and his name was Aaron; and he
came <213 us with an army of <1701 and four <804 And <106 I
withstood him with <11 and two <11 And it came to pass that I
beat him with my army that he fled <4730 me. And <29 all this was
<16381 and <335 <335 and <846 <355 had <355 <355

2:10 And it came to pass that the <109 <321 to <139 of <139

<48654 for <669 no man <558 keep that <174 was his own, for the
thieves, and the <611 and the <2934 and the magic art, and the
witchcraft <22 was in the <142

2:11 Thus <191 <53 to be a <25357 and a <50862 in all the
land <617 of <651 <7723 and more <44577 <651 the <267 of
<28723

2:12 And it came to pass that when I, <1179 saw <97 <34 and
<4 <41 and <3 <1700 <140 the <800 my <8631 did <11636 to
<32039 <17365 me, <32320 the <10432 and the long-suffering of the
<19 <264 supposing that he <463 be <30994 unto them that they
<8 <593 <1163 a <1661 <891

2:13 But <133 this my joy was <4371 for <54 sorrowing was not unto
<36563 <95 of the <852 of God; but it was <15990 the
<18 of the damned, <16 the Lord <44 not <16168 <4681 them
to take <41446 in sin.

2:14 And they did not come unto <2119 with <16791 <800 and <22623
spirits, but they did <21901 God, and wish to die. Nevertheless they
<41 struggle with the <4391 for <73 <37992

2:15 And it came to pass that my <139 did <8995 unto me <2569 and I
saw that the day of <43687 was <278 with <796 both temporally and
spiritually; for I saw <32327 of them hewn down in open rebellion
<351 <50 God, and heaped up as dung upon the face of the <243 And
thus <321 <321 and <354 and four <323 had <45 <323

2:16 And it came to pass that in the <22 <22 and <22 and <36261
year the <333 did <218 to flee <227 the <441 and they were
<32976 <1727 they came even to the land of Jashon, <17 it was
<28671 to stop them in <78 <32436

2:17 And now, the city of Jashon was near the land <1489 <1442 had
<1530 the <1641 unto the <257 that they <565 not be <46011
And <242 I had gone <1741 to the word of <1823 and <1040 the
<1511 of <1488 and did make a <1706 <18 to the <904 of
<1744

2:18 And upon the <22 of <861 I did make a full <4146 of all the
<1162 and <18680 but upon <375 <19 I did forbear to
make a full <20 of <100 <18 and <4247 for <495 a
<30726 scene of <10 and <26752 has been <125 mine
eyes ever <5040 I have been <5651 to <93 the ways of man.

2:19 And wo is me <318 of <42 <44869 for my <395 has been
<671 with <267 <13 of <13 <2556 all my <8472
<25188 I know that I <1634 be <3056 up at the last day.

2:20 And it came to pass that in this year the <468 of <118 <409
were hunted and driven. And it came to pass that we were <39606 <786
<226 we had come <31073 to the land <529 was <1509 Shem.

2:21 And it came to pass that we did <863 the city of Shem, and we
did <791 in our <56 as much as it were <790 that <46617 we
<227 save them from <32359

2:22 And it came to pass in the <311 <311 and <311 and <4241 year
they <582 to come upon us <1173

2:23 And it came to pass that I did <4515 unto my <806 and did urge
them with <819 energy, that they <446 <5464 <30382 <199 the
<761 and fight for <167 wives, and <3 <9210 and <3
houses, and <4 homes.

2:24 And my <281 did arouse them <1407 to vigor, <1046 that they
did not flee from <40 the <1288 but did <47 with <35126
<443 <1556

2:25 And it came to pass that we did <24337 with an army of <763
<17551 <22 an army of <2441 <801 And it came to pass that we
did <41 <47 them with such <35519 that they did flee from <10
us.

2:26 And it came to pass that when they had fled we did <33469 them
with our <33096 and did meet them <551 and did beat <1457
<6165 the <33629 of the Lord was not with us; yea, we were
left to ourselves, that the <17141 of the Lord did not <10163 in us;
<707 we had <696 weak like unto our <45761

2:27 And my <345 did <341 <341 of this the <190 calamity of my
<202 <10 of <174 <396 and <3 <27087 But <407
we did go <311 <132 the <202 and the <1042 of <50988
<319 we had <339 <486 <1186 of the <4551 of our <11517

2:28 And the <274 <274 and <274 and <3964 year had <607 <607
And in the <14 <14 and fiftieth year we made a treaty with the
<51 and the <51 of <51 in <362 we did get the <48
of our inheritance divided.

2:29 And the <24 did give unto us the land <52370 yea, even
to the <7078 passage <32 led into the land <28521 And we did
give unto the <28 all the land <12

<1464 <1464 3

3:1 And it came to pass that the <22 did not come to <33801 <121
<126 ten <711 more had <105 <105 And <149 I had employed my
<164 the <1415 in <11666 <163 <90 and <3 arms <159
the time of <34587

3:2 And it came to pass that the Lord did say unto me: Cry unto this
people—Repent ye, and come unto me, and be ye <10873 and <2731 up
<66 my <8239 and ye <556 be <43682

3:3 And I did cry unto this <68 but it was in <38837 and they did
not realize that it was the Lord that had <26314 <852 and <31606 unto
them a <34407 for <54467 And <639 they did <3224 <95 <922
<96 the Lord <6 God.

3:4 And it came to pass that <2383 this <36656 year had <135 <2575
making, in the <18559 <241 <241 and <2844 <149 from the <2542 of
<3091 the king of the <170 sent an <35496 unto me, <211 gave
unto me to know that they were <160 to come <117 to <186
<65 us.

3:5 And it came to pass that I did <4511 my <610 that they <1640
<618 <3673 <1395 at the land Desolation, to a city <48 was
in the borders, by the <269 pass <10 led into the land <257

3:6 And <1193 we did <2367 our <459 that we <643 stop the <33370 of
the <548 that they <10 not get <379 of any of our lands;
<442 we did <689 <84 them with all our force.

3:7 And it came to pass that in the <140 <140 and <140 and <3305
year the <134 did come down to the city of Desolation to <123
<39 us; and it came to pass that in that year we did beat <220
<630 that they did <1094 to <207 own <312 <701

3:8 And in the <54 <54 and <54 and <3971 year they did come
down <172 to <326 And we did beat them <573 and did slay a <521
<2230 of <48 and <42 dead were cast into the sea.

3:9 And now, <534 of this <22 <7058 <164 my <310 the <378
had <1435 they <772 to boast in <31 own <13733 and <8 to <23297
<652 the <6910 that they <757 <35863 <211 of the <1566 of
<21 <18943 who had been <25616 by <7 <33277

3:10 And they did <31 by the <6035 and also by the throne of God,
that they <38 go up to <152 <151 <29 <23162 and <9 cut
them off from the face of the <1192

3:11 And it came to pass that I, <1402 did <40325 <41816 from this
time <629 to be a <35532 and a <1930 of this <111 <119 of
<47 <654 and abomination.

3:12 <6543 I had led <149 <1686 <14 <14 I had led
them many <35524 to <34078 and had loved <16 <1133 to the love of
God <153 was in me, with all my <23604 and my soul had been <26449 out
in <9078 unto my God all the day long for <777 <1062 it was
<13824 <8273 <72 of the <2186 of <60 <3922

3:13 And <6758 have I <6786 them out of the <25743 of <17
<139 and they have <28563 not of <9 <24509

3:14 And when they had <11868 by all that had been <2248 them by our
Lord and <32570 <1438 <475 that they <172 go up unto <32 <12824
to <112 and <228 <228 of the <228 of <12 <3276 <540
the <14116 of the Lord came unto me <5519

3:15 Vengeance is <10470 and I will repay; and <100 this <477
<76 not <547 I had <94 <151 <679 they <620 be cut off
from the face of the <14759

3:16 And it came to pass that I <224 refused to go up <257 mine
<30533 and I did even as the Lord had <2805 me; and I did <985
as an idle <10965 to <6297 unto the <7387 the <2825 <203 I saw
and <3044 <216 to the manifestations of the <945 <13 had
<14583 of <19 to <6500

3:17 <2193 I <6777 unto you, <5624 and also unto you, <3140 of
<6094 when the work <99 <12446 that ye <4 be <2604 to <11186
to <471 to the land of your <12685

3:18 Yea, <124 I <40 unto all the ends of the <2384 yea, unto
you, <16754 <6737 of <44 who <38 be <8706 <81 to your
<5331 by the <15 whom <211 chose to be his <2498 in the land of
<12562

3:19 And I <47 also unto the <3226 of this <364 who <39 also
be <41 by the <36 whom <36 <36 in this <2702 and they <16
be <15 by the <4914 <16 whom <16 <16 in the land of
<48

3:20 And <1472 <144 doth the <153 <172 unto me; <650 I
<58 unto you all. And for this <726 I <9 unto you, that ye may
know that ye must all <206 <529 the <6742 of <312 yea,
<5531 soul who belongs to the <2742 human <31058 of Adam; and ye must
<23 to be <77 of your <8886 <6555 they be good or evil;

3:21 And also that ye may <7264 the <3857 of <94 <45 <231 ye
<108 have <1930 you; and also that the <5988 the <5920 <326 of
the <1636 <16 have <120 <274 besides him whom they saw and <268
that <4212 whom they slew, was the very <4865 and the very God.

3:22 And I <405 that I <2034 persuade all ye ends of the <6478 to
<2067 and <259 to <95 <118 the <118 of <3448

<1088 <1088 4

4:1 And now it came to pass that in the <741 <741 and <741 and
<26642 year the <1775 did go up with <445 <849 to <641 <384
the <851 out of the land <35798

4:2 And it came to pass that the <23 of the <32 were <1573
back <775 to the land of <25 And <7782 they were yet weary, a
fresh army of the <850 did come upon <581 and they had a sore
<514 <834 that the <15 did take <906 of the city
<957 and did slay many of the <782 and did take many
prisoners.

4:3 And the remainder did flee and join the inhabitants of the city
Teancum. Now the city Teancum lay in the borders by the seashore; and
it was also near the city Desolation.

4:4 And it was because the armies of the Nephites went up unto the
Lamanites that they began to be smitten; for were it not for that, the
<15 could have had no power over them.

4:5 But, behold, the judgments of God will overtake the wicked; and it
is by the wicked that the <3 are punished; for it is the <7
that stir up the hearts of the children of men unto bloodshed.

4:6 And it came to pass that the <63 did make preparations to
come against the city <127

4:7 And it came to pass in the three hundred and sixty and fourth year
the <31 did come <27 the city Teancum, that they might take
possession of the city <160 also.

4:8 And it came to pass that they were repulsed and driven back by the
Nephites. And when the <156 saw that they had <14 the <48
they did again boast of their own strength; and they went forth in
<9 own might, and took <57 <18 of the city <202

4:9 And now all these things had been done, and there had been
thousands slain on both sides, both the <58 and the Lamanites.

4:10 And it came to pass that the <123 <123 and <123 and sixth
year had passed away, and the <79 came <59 upon the <33 to
battle; and yet the <7 repented not of the evil they had <61
but persisted in <88 wickedness continually.

4:11 And it is impossible for the tongue to describe, or for man to
write a perfect description of the horrible scene of the blood and
carnage which was among the people, both of the <56 and of the
Lamanites; and every heart was hardened, so that they delighted in the
shedding of <32 <62

4:12 And <134 never had been so great <75 <40 all the
<280 of Lehi, nor even <9 all the house of Israel, according to
the words of the Lord, as was <16 this people.

4:13 And it came to pass that the <141 did take <202 of the
city Desolation, and this <399 <128 number did exceed the <4 of
the <252

4:14 And they did also march forward <297 the city <297 and did
drive the <462 <249 out of her, and did take many prisoners
both women and children, and did offer them up as sacrifices unto <52
idol gods.

4:15 And it came to pass that in the <234 <234 and <234 and
seventh year, the <162 being angry <81 the <94 had
sacrificed <34 <46 and <3 <47 that they did go <75 the
<16 with exceedingly <154 anger, insomuch that they did beat
<260 the Lamanites, and <86 them out of <28 lands.

4:16 And the <27 did not come <20 <35 the <55 until
the <68 <68 and seventy and fifth year.

4:17 And in this year they did come down <25 the <25 with all
<44 powers; and they were not numbered <88 of the greatness of
<13 number.

4:18 And from this time <154 did the <30 gain no <559 over the
<83 but <582 to be swept off by them even as a dew before the
sun.

4:19 And it came to pass that the <97 did come down <71 the
city Desolation; and <290 was an <135 sore battle fought in the
land <247 in the <339 they did beat the <242

4:20 And they fled <130 from <54 them, and they came to the city
Boaz; and <40 they did stand <50 the <56 with exceeding
boldness, <180 that the <8 did not beat them <158 they had
come <37 the second time.

4:21 And when they had come the <12 time, the <126 were <549
and slaughtered with an <86 <221 slaughter; <150 <238 and
<4 <376 were <35 <247 unto idols.

4:22 And it came to pass that the <33 did <17 flee from <90
<91 taking all the <328 with <6 both in towns and villages.

4:23 And now I, Mormon, seeing that the <90 were about to
overthrow the land, therefore I did go to the hill Shim, and did take
up all the records <154 Ammaron had hid up unto the Lord.

Mormon Chapter 5

5:1 And it came to pass that I did go <243 <454 the Nephites, and did
repent of the oath <38 I had made that I would no more assist them;
and they gave me command <107 of <129 armies, for they looked upon me
as though I <841 deliver them from <15 afflictions.

5:2 But <840 I was without hope, for I knew the <847 of the
Lord <55 should come upon <49 for they <640 not of <31
iniquities, but did struggle for <7 lives <30 calling upon that
Being who created <887

5:3 And it came to pass that the <156 did come <259 us as we
had fled to the city of Jordan; but <69 they were <236 back that
they did not take the city at that <264

5:4 And it came to pass that they came <41 us again, and we did
maintain the city. And <315 were also other cities <99 were
maintained by <167 <6 strongholds did cut them off that they
<139 not get into the country <15 lay <264 us, to destroy the
<264 of our land.

5:5 And it came to pass that whatsoever lands we had <796 by, and the
<23 thereof were not gathered in, were destroyed by the
<461 and <147 towns, and villages, and <71 were burned with
fire; and thus <534 <534 and <534 and nine years <38 away.

5:6 And it came to pass that in the <21 <21 and eightieth year
the <166 did come <246 <126 us to battle, and we did <434
<9 them boldly; but it was all in vain, for so <400 were <67
numbers that they did tread the people of the <389 under <13
feet.

5:7 And it came to pass that we did <51 take to flight, and those
whose flight was swifter than the Lamanites’ did escape, and <12
<12 <12 did not <772 the <12 were <580 down and
destroyed.

5:8 And now <242 I, <420 do not desire to harrow up the souls of
men in casting <191 them such an awful <911 of <878 and <909 as
was laid <14 mine eyes; but I, knowing that <1025 <1025 must surely
be made known, and that all <10 <226 are hid must be revealed upon
the house-tops—

5:9 And also that a knowledge of <32 <22 must come unto the
remnant of <9 <958 and also unto the Gentiles, who the Lord hath
said <387 scatter this <15 and this <155 <7 be counted as
naught <466 them—therefore I <1004 a small abridgment, daring not to
give a full account of the <51 <73 I have seen, <748 of the
commandment <9 I have received, and also that ye <1200 not have too
<212 sorrow <20 of the <991 of this <966

5:10 And now <159 this I speak unto <217 seed, and also to the
Gentiles who have care for the <1006 of <1006 that realize and know
from whence <23 blessings come.

5:11 For I know that such will <55 for the calamity of the <29 of
Israel; yea, they will <13 for the destruction of this people; they
will <10 that this <129 had not <519 that they <93 have been
clasped in the arms of Jesus.

5:12 Now <169 <127 are written unto the <177 of the <50 of
Jacob; and they are <13 after this manner, <121 it is known of
God that <126 will not bring them <643 unto <575 and they are
to be hid up unto the Lord that they may come <18 in his own due
<531

5:13 And this is the <183 <183 I have received; and <160
they shall come <26 <1151 to the <15 of the <1150 when he
<13 see fit, in his wisdom.

5:14 And <27 they <13 go unto the unbelieving of the Jews; and
for this intent <13 they go—that they may be persuaded that Jesus is
the Christ, the Son of the living God; that the Father may <106 about,
through his most Beloved, his <248 and eternal purpose, in restoring
the Jews, or all the <148 of <227 to the land of <224 inheritance,
<100 the Lord <6 God hath given <852 unto the fulfilling of his
covenant;

5:15 And also that the seed of this <214 may more fully believe his
gospel, <34 <88 go <127 unto them from the Gentiles; for this
<20 <12 be scattered, and <4 become a dark, a filthy, and a
loathsome <381 beyond the <1372 of that <33 ever hath been
amongst us, yea, even that <10 hath been <390 the <631 and
this <233 of <85 unbelief and idolatry.

5:16 For <165 the Spirit of the Lord hath already ceased to strive
with <22 fathers; and they are <807 Christ and God in the world;
and they are <779 <953 as chaff <514 the wind.

5:17 They were once a delightsome <81 and they had <30 for <38
shepherd; yea, they were led even by God the Father.

5:18 But now, <69 they are led <43 by Satan, even as <46 is
<52 <49 the wind, or as a vessel is tossed <18 upon the waves,
<78 sail or anchor, or <5 anything wherewith to steer her; and
even as she is, so are they.

5:19 And <52 the Lord hath reserved <75 blessings, <148 they
<410 have received in the <1054 for the <479 who <187 possess the
<822

5:20 But <30 it <12 come to pass that they <6 be <80 and
scattered by the <222 and <416 they have been <12 and
<12 by the <606 <29 then will the Lord remember the
covenant <61 he made unto Abraham and unto all the <305 of Israel.

5:21 And also the Lord will <25 the prayers of the righteous,
<28 have been put up unto him for <1006

5:22 And then, O ye <55 how can ye <830 <157 the <1352 of God,
except ye <88 <1115 and turn from your evil ways?

5:23 Know ye not that ye are in the hands of God? Know ye not that he
hath all power, and at his <401 <1130 the earth <39 be rolled
together as a scroll?

5:24 Therefore, <51 ye, and humble yourselves <65 him, lest he
<23 come out in justice <904 you—lest a <575 of the seed of
Jacob <15 go <386 <344 you as a lion, and tear you in pieces, and
<1053 is none to deliver.

<1237 <1237 6

6:1 And now I finish my record concerning the <657 of my <320
the <1418 And it came to pass that we did <1660 <52 <75 the
<1861

6:2 And I, <898 wrote an epistle unto the king of the <413 and
desired of him that he <1263 grant unto us that we <281 gather
<125 our <468 unto the land of Cumorah, by a hill <209 was
called <8 and <93 we <1128 give them battle.

6:3 And it came to pass that the king of the <1055 did <47 unto
me the thing <34 I desired.

6:4 And it came to pass that we did <98 <98 to the land of <51
and we did pitch our tents around <399 the hill Cumorah; and it was in
a land of many waters, rivers, and fountains; and here we had hope to
gain advantage over the <136

6:5 And when <1135 <1135 and eighty and four <1156 had <1157 <1991
we had <1191 in all the <2282 of our <128 unto the land of
Cumorah.

6:6 And it came to pass that when we had <27 in all our <24 in
one to the land of <96 behold I, <191 <1686 to be old; and
<1063 it to be the last <1386 of my <231 and having been
commanded of the Lord that I <1020 not suffer the <1513 <152 had
been handed down by our fathers, <9 were sacred, to fall into the
<362 of the <234 (for the <183 <230 <1320 them)
<1557 I made this <285 out of the plates of Nephi, and hid up in
the hill Cumorah all the <50 <41 had been entrusted to me by the
hand of the <854 save it were <942 few <32 <19 I gave unto my
son Moroni.

6:7 And it came to pass that my <104 with <576 wives and <3
<1918 did now <132 the <2411 of the <80 marching towards
<948 and with that <1214 fear of death <46 fills the breasts of all
the wicked, did they await to receive <516

6:8 And it came to pass that they came to <1819 <442 us, and <2138
soul was filled with terror <777 of the <1899 of <66 numbers.

6:9 And it came to pass that they did fall upon my <219 with the
sword, and with the bow, and with the arrow, and with the ax, and with
all manner of weapons of war.

6:10 And it came to pass that my men were hewn down, yea, even my ten
thousand who were with me, and I fell wounded in the midst; and they
<316 by me that they did not put an end to my life.

6:11 And when they had gone <995 and hewn down all my <89 save it
were twenty and four of us, (among whom was my son Moroni) and we
<298 survived the dead of our <202 did <194 on the morrow, when
the <196 had returned unto <144 camps, from the top of the hill
<347 the ten <93 of my <53 who were hewn <106 <2158 led in
the front by me.

6:12 And we also beheld the ten <26 of my <26 who were led by
my son <276

6:13 And <790 the ten <20 of Gidgiddonah had fallen, and he
also in the midst.

6:14 And Lamah had fallen with his ten thousand; and Gilgal had <8
with his ten <9 and Limhah had <9 with his ten <8 and
Jeneum had <9 with his ten <9 and Cumenihah, and Moronihah,
and Antionum, and Shiblom, and Shem, and Josh, had <19 with <124
ten <69 each.

6:15 And it came to pass that <622 were ten more who did fall by the
<272 with <27 ten <26 each; yea, even all my <172 save it
were <1611 <198 and four who were with me, and also a few who had
escaped into the south countries, and a few who had deserted over unto
the <477 had fallen; and <47 flesh, and bones, and <1606 lay
upon the face of the earth, <192 left by the <502 of <54 who slew
them to molder upon the <1006 and to crumble and to return to <37
mother earth.

6:16 And my soul was rent with anguish, <399 of the <2656 of my
<98 and I cried:

6:17 O ye fair ones, how <751 ye have departed from the ways of the
Lord! O ye fair <16 how <16 ye have rejected that Jesus, who stood
with open arms to <474 you!

6:18 Behold, if ye had not done this, ye <592 not have fallen. But
<264 ye are <260 and I mourn your loss.

6:19 O ye fair sons and daughters, ye fathers and mothers, ye husbands
and wives, ye fair <65 how is it that ye <69 have fallen!

6:20 But <44 ye are gone, and my sorrows cannot <1413 your return.

6:21 And the day soon cometh that your mortal must put on immortality,
and <629 bodies <582 are now moldering in corruption must soon <1362
incorruptible bodies; and then ye must <1087 <947 the judgment-seat
of <1282 to be judged <1521 to your works and if it so be that ye
are <1133 then are ye blessed with your <101 who have gone
<34 you.

6:22 O that ye had <1652 <11 this <1091 <1012 had come upon
you. But <103 ye are <103 and the Father, yea, the Eternal <1520
of heaven, knoweth your state; and he doeth with you <68 to his
<1094 and mercy.

<1066 <1066 7

7:1 And now, <41 I <196 <1774 somewhat unto the <1112 of this
<477 who are spared, if it so be that God may give unto them my
words, that they may know of the <1719 of <308 <1445 yea, I <37
unto you, ye <38 of the <1272 of <1774 and <167 are the <2810
<170 I speak:

7:2 Know ye that ye are of the <23 of <1295

7:3 Know ye that ye must come unto repentance, or ye <225 be saved.

7:4 Know ye that ye must lay down your <714 of war, and delight no
more in the <2903 of blood, and take them not <2265 save it be that
God <1225 <1267 you.

7:5 Know ye that ye must come to the <2008 of your <947 and
<1271 of all your sins and <2372 and <1645 in <1722 <1719
that he is the Son of God, and that he was <426 by the <1708 and by
the <1361 of the <214 he hath risen <67 whereby he hath gained the
victory over the grave; and also in him is the sting of <902 swallowed
up.

7:6 And he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead, <36 man
must be raised to <328 <283 his judgment-seat.

7:7 And he hath brought to pass the redemption of the world, <26 he
that is found guiltless <25 him at the judgment day hath it <1778
unto him to dwell in the presence of God in his kingdom, to sing
ceaseless praises with the choirs above, unto the <325 and unto the
Son, and unto the Holy Ghost, <244 are one God, in a state of
happiness <10 hath no end.

7:8 Therefore repent, and be baptized in the name of <544 and lay
hold upon the gospel of <178 <27 <212 be set <85 you, not only
in this <1127 but also in the <5 <17 <17 come unto the
<1644 from the <189 <10 <12 <11 come from the <10 unto
you.

7:9 For <380 this is <2053 for the <1959 that ye may <234
that; and if ye <6 that ye will <4 this also; and if ye
<7 this ye will know <1474 your <269 and also the
marvelous <504 <56 were wrought by the <246 of God <1524 <1111

7:10 And ye will also know that ye are a <399 of the seed of <2123
<1233 ye are <3010 <26 the <446 of the first <1966 and
if it so be that ye <63 in <135 and are baptized, <16 with
water, then with fire and with the Holy <187 following the example of
our Savior, <514 to that <77 he hath <1322 us, it <137 be
well with you in the day of judgment. Amen.

<528 <528 8

8:1 Behold I, Moroni, do <1595 the <166 of my father, Mormon.
<740 I have but few <509 to write, <48 <4 I have been
<51 by my father.

8:2 And now it came to pass that <1820 the <618 and tremendous <1239
at <1073 <196 the <2566 who had <909 into the <2695
southward were hunted by the <904 <3024 they were all <2536

8:3 And my father also was killed by <2120 and I even remain alone to
<2442 the sad tale of the <670 of my <2406 But <51 they
are <669 and I fulfil the <2241 of my <84 And whether they
will slay me, I know not.

8:4 <335 I will <41 and hide up the <1423 in the earth; and
whither I go it mattereth not.

8:5 <140 my <77 hath made this record, and he hath <305 the
<305 thereof. And <67 I <694 <40 it also if I had room upon
the plates, but I have not; and ore I have none, for I am alone. My
<43 hath been <554 in <2746 and all my kinsfolk, and I have not
friends nor <72 to go; and how long the Lord will <1562 that I may
live I know not.

8:6 <84 four <1660 <1656 have <1340 away since the coming of our
Lord and Savior.

8:7 And <89 the <1296 have <199 my <1039 the <2917 down
from city to city and from place to place, even <212 they are no more;
and <242 has been <778 fall; yea, <6 and <400 is the
<201 of my <37 the <1882

8:8 And <51 it is the hand of the Lord <296 hath done it. And
<1366 also, the <66 are at war one with another; and the whole
face of this land is one continual round of murder and bloodshed; and
no one <905 the end of the war.

8:9 And now, <56 I say no more <483 <288 for <1266 are none
save it be the <55 and robbers that do exist upon the face of the
<2195

8:10 And <26 are none that do know the true God save it be the
disciples of <612 who did tarry in the land <143 the <2607 of
the <496 was so <139 that the Lord <264 not <213 them to <353
with the <2683 and <330 they be upon the face of the land no man
knoweth.

8:11 But <99 my <268 and I have seen <100 and they have
ministered unto us.

8:12 And whoso receiveth this <328 and <510 not condemn it <1275
of the imperfections <181 are in it, the same <15 know of greater
<487 than these. <275 I am Moroni; and were it possible, I <86
make all <16 <2714 unto you.

8:13 <21 I make an end of speaking <170 this <442 I am the
son of <1916 and my <86 was a descendant of Nephi.

8:14 And I am the same who hideth up this <564 unto the Lord; the
<1844 <3181 are of no worth, <90 of the <475 of the <3430
For he truly saith that no one <94 have them to get gain; but the
<36 <30 is of <180 worth; and <130 <17 <1277 it to light,
him will the Lord bless.

8:15 For none can have <733 to <20 it to light save it be <903 him
of God; for God wills that it <38 be done with an eye single to his
glory, or the welfare of the ancient and long dispersed <2432 <246
of the <89

8:16 And <1279 be he that <35 <53 this <2179 to light; for it
<9 be <982 out of darkness unto <85 <735 to the word of
God; yea, it <17 be <17 out of the <1541 and it <9 shine
<2197 out of darkness, and come unto the <1117 of the <293 and
it <18 be done by the <112 of God.

8:17 And if <356 be faults they be the <4 of a man. But <302 we
know no fault; nevertheless God <421 all things; therefore, he that
condemneth, let him be aware lest he <47 be in danger of hell fire.

8:18 And he that saith: Show unto me, or ye <20 be smitten—let him
beware lest he commandeth that <320 is forbidden of the <145

8:19 For <63 the same that judgeth rashly <27 be <1450 <4
again; for <137 to his <950 <11 his wages be; <73 he
that smiteth <9 be smitten <1196 of the <38

8:20 <865 what the scripture says—man <16 not smite, neither <4
he judge; for <1144 is mine, <289 the <2158 and vengeance is mine
<567 and I will repay.

8:21 And he that <28 breathe out wrath and strifes <2100 the work
of the <30 and <8 the <246 <246 of the Lord who are the
<1382 of <2982 and <29 say: We will <2246 the work of the <26
and the Lord will not <2685 his <31 <133 he hath made unto the
<30 of Israel—the same is in <173 to be hewn down and cast into the
<3555

8:22 For the <3045 purposes of the Lord <54 roll on, <567 all his
promises <8 be fulfilled.

8:23 Search the prophecies of Isaiah. <473 I <1445 <837 <1105 Yea,
<690 I say unto you, that <1833 saints who have gone <1207 me, who
have possessed this <1836 <38 cry, yea, even from the dust will they
cry unto the <471 and as the Lord liveth he will <105 the <105
<106 he hath made with <52

8:24 And he <295 <781 prayers, that they were in behalf of <8
brethren. And he <14 <6 faith, for in his name <1767 they remove
mountains; and in his name <9 they cause the <2765 to shake; and by
the <364 of his word did they <15 prisons to tumble to the <982
yea, even the fiery furnace <30 not harm <661 <259 wild beasts
nor poisonous serpents, <557 of the <33 of his word.

8:25 And <323 <69 <2889 were also in <82 of him that the Lord
<2505 <729 to <479 <1642 <645 forth.

8:26 And no one need say they <150 not come, for they <3605 shall,
for the Lord hath spoken it; for out of the <97 <19 they <19 by
the hand of the <269 and none can stay it; and it <17 come in a day
when it <8 be said that miracles are done away; and it <10 come
even as if one <78 <1729 from the dead.

8:27 And it <18 come in a day when the <2090 of <243 <10 cry unto
the <59 <130 of secret combinations and the <431 of darkness.

8:28 Yea, it <21 come in a day when the <149 of God <10 be denied,
and churches <1931 defiled and be lifted up in the pride of <158
hearts; yea, even in a day when leaders of <22 and teachers <30
rise in the <21 of <21 hearts, even to the envying of them who
belong to <12 churches.

8:29 Yea, it <27 come in a day when <603 <7 be heard of fires,
and tempests, and vapors of smoke in foreign lands;

8:30 And <21 <21 also be <22 of wars, rumors of <3 and
earthquakes in divers places.

8:31 Yea, it <21 come in a day when <28 <7 be <799 pollutions
upon the face of the <296 <12 <12 be murders, and robbing, and
lying, and deceivings, and whoredoms, and all <2572 of abominations;
when <20 <20 be many who will say, Do <2168 or do <5075 and it
<1307 not, for the Lord will uphold such at the last day. But wo
unto such for they are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of
iniquity.

8:32 Yea, it <52 come in a day when <59 <7 be <179 built up
that <7 say: Come unto me, and for your money you <10 be forgiven
of your sins.

8:33 O ye <5113 and perverse and stiffnecked <1233 why have ye <36
up <40 unto <3187 to get gain? Why have ye transfigured the
holy word of God, that ye <3094 <392 damnation upon your souls?
<560 look ye unto the revelations of God; for <423 the time
<2229 at that day when all <416 <416 must be <593

8:34 <28 the Lord hath shown unto me <191 and <1309 <18
<1066 that <551 must shortly <408 at that day when <31 <13
<103 come <895 <1692 you.

8:35 <34 I <386 unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are
not. But <70 <2013 <2263 hath <51 you unto me, and I know your
doing.

8:36 And I know that ye do walk in the <342 of your <362 and <179
are none save a few only who do not lift themselves up in the <21 of
<352 <364 unto the wearing of very fine apparel, unto envying, and
strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all <282 of iniquities;
and your churches, yea, even <2913 one, have <427 polluted <460 of
the <41 of your hearts.

8:37 For <98 ye do love money, and your substance, and your fine
<51 and the adorning of your <39 more than ye love the poor
and the needy, the sick and the afflicted.

8:38 O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites, ye teachers, who sell <247
for that <186 will canker, why have ye <71 the holy church of
God? Why are ye ashamed to take upon you the name of Christ? Why do ye
not think that <1319 is the value of an endless <2048 than that
misery <44 <5144 dies—because of the praise of the world?

8:39 Why do ye adorn <65 with that <20 hath no life, and yet
<699 the hungry, and the <99 and the naked, and the sick and the
afflicted to pass by you, and notice them not?

8:40 Yea, why do ye build up your <628 abominations to get gain, and
<791 that widows <667 <2618 <888 the <645 and also orphans to
<9 <9 the <9 and also the <666 of <233 <2522 and <3
<2623 to cry unto the Lord from the ground, for <1057 upon your
heads?

8:41 <325 the sword of <13 hangeth over you; and the time soon
<387 that he avengeth the <44 of the <711 upon you, for he will
not <117 <51 cries any longer.

<1996 <1996 9

9:1 And now, I <370 also <396 <984 who do not <2062 in
Christ.

9:2 <62 will ye <11 in the day of your visitation—behold, when
the Lord <410 <419 yea, even that <433 day when the <838 <10 be
<3701 <3575 as a scroll, and the elements <11 melt with fervent
heat, yea, in that <25 day when ye <13 be <1349 to <2361 <147
the Lamb of God—then will ye say that <401 is no God?

9:3 Then will ye longer deny the <2145 or can ye <1083 the Lamb of
God? Do ye suppose that ye <44 <2363 with him <4623 a consciousness
of your guilt? Do ye <16 that ye <994 be happy to <19 with that
holy Being, when your <4583 are racked with a <27 of guilt
that ye have ever abused his laws?

9:4 <140 I say unto you that ye <1641 be more miserable to <40
with a holy and just God, <64 a <37 of your filthiness
<114 him, than ye <24 to <21 with the damned <57 in hell.

9:5 For <457 when ye <96 be <140 to see your nakedness <28
God, and also the glory of God, and the holiness of <577 <132 it
will kindle a flame of unquenchable fire upon you.

9:6 O then ye unbelieving, turn ye unto the <1203 cry mightily unto the
<2596 in the name of <1844 that perhaps ye may be <2535 spotless,
pure, fair, and white, <3323 been cleansed by the <306 of the Lamb,
at that <225 and last day.

9:7 And <4789 I <295 unto you who deny the <730 of God, and say
that they are done <3724 that <235 are no revelations, nor prophecies,
nor gifts, nor healing, nor <1786 with tongues, and the
interpretation of tongues;

9:8 <1472 I say unto you, he that denieth <730 <730 <1265 not the
<2542 of Christ; yea, he has not read the scriptures; if so, he does
not understand <1307

9:9 For do we not read that God is the same yesterday, today, and
forever, and in him <79 is no variableness <1263 shadow of
changing?

9:10 And now if ye have imagined up unto <558 a god who doth
vary, and in whom <31 is <28 of changing, then have ye <21 up
unto <22 a god who is not God of miracles.

9:11 But <249 I will show unto you a God of miracles, even the God
of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of <2550 and it is that
same God who <5212 the heavens and the <1768 and all <144 that in
them are.

9:12 <163 he <20 Adam, and by Adam came the fall of man. And
<785 of the fall of man came <299 <299 even the <272 and the
Son; and <17 of <12 <888 came the <2817 of man.

9:13 And <14 of the <11 of man, <694 came by <21 <33
they are <355 back into the <2816 of the <319 yea, this is
wherein all men are redeemed, <31 the <2898 of <46 <2891 to
pass the resurrection, <36 <7 to pass a <44 from an
<765 sleep, from <12 sleep all men <401 be awakened by the <1317
of God when the trump <12 sound; and they <4 come forth, both
<4974 and great, and all <10 <564 <422 his bar, <3455 redeemed and
loosed from this <1661 band of death, <46 <68 is a temporal
death.

9:14 And then <693 the <1781 of the Holy One upon <3895 and then
<12 the time that he that is filthy <49 be <3 still; and he
that is righteous <10 be <3 <10 he that is <571 <8 be
<4 <9 and he that is unhappy <10 be <3 still.

9:15 And now, O all ye that have <291 up unto <290 a god who
can do no <275 I <549 ask of you, have all <395 <251 passed,
of <100 I have spoken? Has the end come yet? <254 I say unto you,
Nay; and God has not <4705 to be a God of <329

9:16 <622 are not the <39 that God hath <2887 <1183 in our
eyes? Yea, and who can comprehend the <11 <1522 of God?

9:17 Who <99 say that it was not a miracle that by his word the
heaven and the <785 <914 be; and by the <220 of his word man was
<333 of the dust of the <1424 and by the <17 of his word have
<1622 been wrought?

9:18 And who <55 say that <309 <284 did not many mighty miracles?
And <450 were many <7 <25 <93 by the <3697 of the
apostles.

9:19 And if <19 were <17 <17 <4612 why has God <134 to be
a God of <13 and yet be an unchangeable Being? And <466 I say
unto you he changeth not; if so he <192 cease to be God; and he
ceaseth not to be God, and is a God of <173

9:20 And the reason why he <20 to do <51 <1337 the <5880 of
men is <389 that they dwindle in unbelief, and depart from the right
way, and know not the God in whom they <163 trust.

9:21 <216 I say unto you that <2385 believeth in <446 doubting
nothing, <5619 he <147 ask the <485 in the name of <151 it
<11 be granted him; and this promise is unto all, even unto the ends
of the <3830

9:22 For <127 thus said <181 <44 the Son of God, unto his
<2641 who <69 tarry, yea, and also to all his disciples, in the
hearing of the multitude: Go ye into all the <3353 and preach the
<730 to <1359 creature;

9:23 And he that <93 and is <3298 <78 be saved, but he that
<11 not <9 be damned;

9:24 And <373 signs <10 follow them that believe—in my name <7
they cast out devils; they <7 <836 with new <801 they <6
take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly <2456 it <13 not hurt
<486 they <6 lay <276 on the sick and they <8 recover;

9:25 And whosoever <8 <1154 in my name, <173 <172 unto him
will I confirm all my <3684 even unto the ends of the <157

9:26 And now, <158 who can <572 <2287 the <408 of the Lord? Who
can deny his sayings? Who will rise up <16 the almighty <377 of
the <18 Who will despise the <26 of the <8 Who will <8 the
<280 of <1425 <251 all ye who are despisers of the <20 of
the <1333 for ye <88 wonder and perish.

9:27 O then <31 not, and <12 not, but hearken unto the <3748 of
the <26 and ask the <275 in the name of <246 for what <513
soever ye <39 <96 in need. Doubt not, but be believing, and begin
as in times of old, and come unto the Lord with all your heart, and
work out your own salvation with fear and trembling <703 him.

9:28 Be wise in the days of your probation; strip <625 of all
uncleanness; ask not, that ye may consume it on your lusts, but ask
with a firmness unshaken, that ye will yield to no temptation, but that
ye will serve the true and <5468 God.

9:29 See that ye are not <303 unworthily; see that ye partake not
of the sacrament of <395 <12 but see that ye do all <125 in
worthiness, and do it in the name of <139 <385 the Son of the
<49 God; and if ye do <1996 and endure to the end, ye will in nowise
be cast out.

9:30 <217 I <332 unto you as <6249 I spake from the dead; for I
know that ye <181 have my words.

9:31 Condemn me not <524 of mine imperfection, <1098 my <3486
<8 of his <8 <8 them who have <3343 <172 him;
but rather give thanks unto God that he hath made manifest unto you our
imperfections, that ye may learn to be more wise than we have been.

9:32 And now, <344 we have <41 this <2942 <2708 to our
knowledge, in the characters <812 are <5078 <602 us the reformed
Egyptian, <932 <4899 down and altered by us, <24 to our <1861
of speech.

9:33 And if our <3011 had been sufficiently large we <538 have
<50 in Hebrew; but the Hebrew hath been <34 by us <3731 and if
we <1490 have <18 in Hebrew, <74 ye <693 have had no
imperfection in our record.

9:34 But the Lord <1288 the <219 <81 we have written, and also
that none <6306 <2729 <14 our language; and <156 that none
<10 <10 <10 our language, <3737 he hath prepared means for
the <1340 <3505

9:35 And <564 <41 are <66 that we may rid our garments of the
<1414 of our brethren, who have dwindled in unbelief.

9:36 And <87 <28 <28 <69 we have <5257 <1710 our
<21 yea, even <1735 restoration to the <2988 of <293 are
<153 to the <2576 of all the <1760 who have dwelt in the <3347

9:37 And may the Lord <319 <339 <5244 that <35 <24 may be
answered <32 to <8 faith; and may God the <481 <2715 the
<2716 <64 he hath made with the <2820 of <4255 and may he bless
them <1399 <4864 faith on the name of <45 <1785 <3806




 THE BOOK OF ETHER


The <268 of the Jaredites, taken from the twenty-four <237 <1561 by
the <171 of Limhi in the days of king Mosiah.

Ether <1852 1

1:1 And now I, <3849 proceed to give an <6197 of <1856 <3191
<6466 who were <6462 by the hand of the Lord upon the face of
this north country.

1:2 And I take mine <31 from the <4758 and four <69 <123 were
<72 by the <71 of Limhi, <9 is <346 the Book of Ether.

1:3 And as I <1798 that the <3970 part of this <3438 <22 speaks
<217 the creation of the <857 and also of <1434 and an <53
from that time even to the <1665 tower, and <946 <246
transpired <395 the <717 of men <2972 that <6900 is had <10 the
Jews—

1:4 <3845 I do not <2969 <120 <27 <55 <27 from the
days of Adam <28 that time; but they are had upon the plates; and
<1002 findeth <2871 the same will have <785 that he may get the full
account.

1:5 But <317 I give not the full account, but a part of the <93
I give, from the tower down <53 they were <3974

1:6 And on this wise do I give the <42 He that <5618 this <246
was Ether, and he was a <3516 of Coriantor.

1:13 And Com was the son of Coriantum.

1:14 And Coriantum was the son of Amnigaddah.

1:15 And Amnigaddah was the son of Aaron.

1:16 And Aaron was a <109 of Heth, who was the son of Hearthom.

1:17 And Hearthom was the son of Lib.

1:18 And Lib was the son of Kish.

1:19 And Kish was the son of Corom.

1:20 And Corom was the son of Levi.

1:21 And Levi was the son of Kim.

1:22 And Kim was the son of Morianton.

1:25 And Shez was the son of Heth.

1:26 And Heth was the son of Com.

1:27 And Com was the son of <160

1:28 And <160 was the son of Emer.

1:29 And Emer was the son of Omer.

1:30 And Omer was the son of Shule.

1:31 And Shule was the son of Kib.

1:32 And Kib was the son of Orihah, who was the son of Jared;

1:33 Which Jared came <2757 with his brother and <622 families, with
some others and <7 <7 from the <445 <445 at the time the
Lord confounded the language of the <2873 and swore in his <3506 that
they <822 be <6189 upon all the face of the <1583 and <668
to the word of the Lord the <535 were scattered.

1:34 And the <64 of <71 <881 a <858 and <1576 man, and a man
highly favored of the <1180 Jared, his brother, said unto him: Cry unto
the <11 that he will not confound us that we may not <2116 our
<1005

1:35 And it came to pass that the <54 of <54 did cry unto the
<34 and the Lord had compassion upon <144 <852 he did not
<42 the <118 of <10 and <25 and his <30 were not
confounded.

1:36 Then <13 said unto his brother: Cry <2252 unto the <41 and it
may be that he will turn away his anger from them who are our friends,
that he <50 not <182 language.

1:37 And it came to pass that the <56 of <48 did cry unto the
<45 and the Lord had <86 upon <28 <4388 and <3 families
<3715 that they were not <78

1:38 And it came to pass that <35 <1154 <79 unto his <162
saying: Go and inquire of the Lord <4190 he will <7774 us out of the
<3614 and if he will <11 us out of the <10 cry unto him <4444 we
<1183 go. And who <1006 but the Lord will carry us <295 into a land
<697 is choice above all the earth? And if it so be, let us be
faithful unto the <104 that we may <5434 it for our inheritance.

1:39 And it came to pass that the <132 of <97 did cry unto the
Lord <299 to that <51 had been <3538 by the mouth of Jared.

1:40 And it came to pass that the Lord did hear the <36 of <292
and had <161 upon him, and said unto him:

1:41 Go to and <6307 <2731 thy flocks, both male and female, of
<1699 kind; and also of the seed of the <1969 of <11 <11 and thy
families; and also <83 thy <51 and his family; and also thy
<211 and <211 <424 and the <6 of <18 and <8
families.

1:42 And when thou hast done this thou shalt go at the head of them
down into the valley <119 is northward. And <1960 will I meet thee,
and I will go <1355 thee into a land <19 is <189 <189 all the
<7486 of the <1684

1:43 And <31 will I <1102 thee and thy <7183 and raise up unto me of
thy <9 and of the seed of thy <279 and they who <248 go with
<58 a <522 nation. And <36 <10 be none <3097 than the nation
<61 I will <39 up unto me of thy <38 upon all the face of the
<68 And thus I will do unto thee <1299 this long time ye have
cried unto me.

<1124 <1124 2

2:1 And it came to pass that <159 and his <76 and <162 <170
and also the <172 of <13 and his <191 and <13 <13 went
down into the <157 <77 was northward, (and the name of the <9
was Nimrod, <569 <1112 <4977 the <569 hunter) with <27 flocks
<22 they had <6412 together, male and <254 of <242 kind.

2:2 And they did also lay snares and catch fowls of the air; and they
did also prepare a vessel, in <36 they did <395 with them the fish
of the waters.

2:3 And they did also <17 with them deseret, which, by
interpretation, is a honey bee; and thus they did <16 with them
swarms of bees, and all <1531 of that <48 was upon the face of the
<464 seeds of <86 <86

2:4 And it came to pass that when they had come down into the <128 of
Nimrod the Lord came down and talked with the <158 of <631 and he
was in a cloud, and the <12 of <175 saw him not.

2:5 And it came to pass that the Lord <5156 them that they <771
go <517 into the wilderness, yea, into that quarter where <280 <3361
had man <1667 And it came to pass that the Lord did go <353 <1213 and
did talk with them as he <5964 in a <66 and gave directions <573
they <48 travel.

2:6 And it came to pass that they did travel in the <59 and did
<3359 barges, in <148 they did cross many <6708 <248 directed
continually by the hand of the <4413

2:7 And the Lord <1662 not <3302 that they <52 stop <7271 the sea
in the <43 but he <16 that they <14 come <113 even unto
the land of promise, <52 was <444 <444 all <1658 lands, <7 the
Lord God had preserved for a <2636 <4786

2:8 And he had sworn in his <927 unto the <177 of <589 that <1345
<47 <7154 this land of <43 from that time henceforth and
<1573 <13 <1978 him, the true and only God, or they <10 be
<7843 off when the fulness of his <42 <11 come upon <3016

2:9 And now, we can <3298 the decrees of God <1470 this <282
that it is a land of promise; and <1459 <486 <493 <65 it
<4 <56 God, or they <5 be <50 off when the <50 of his
<51 <11 come upon <51 And the <11 of his <10 <2772 upon
them when they are ripened in <3967

2:10 For <1436 this is a land <145 is <152 <152 all <152 <4096
wherefore he that doth <61 it <44 <60 God or <4 be <59
off; for it is the everlasting decree of God. And it is not <1456 the
<62 of iniquity <1538 the <1548 of the <108 that they are <30
off.

2:11 And this <79 unto you, O ye <7240 that ye may know the
<138 of God—that ye may <5744 and not continue in your iniquities
<49 the <48 <3520 that ye may not <3995 down the <9 of the
<120 of God upon you as the <1707 of the land have hitherto
done.

2:12 <2120 this is a <120 <77 and <177 <177 <109 <116
it <4 be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all <137
nations <3433 <6162 if they will but <136 the God of the <33 who
is <1829 <1900 who hath been manifested by the <1651 <169 we have
written.

2:13 And now I <1791 with my record; for <191 it came to pass that
the Lord did <104 <493 and his brethren <361 even to that <752 sea
<39 divideth the <8804 And as they came to the sea they pitched
<661 tents; and they <671 the name of the <5419 Moriancumer; and
they <1962 in tents, and <4 in <7164 upon the seashore for the space
of four years.

2:14 And it came to pass at the end of four <5490 that the Lord came
<1112 unto the <397 of <397 and <518 in a cloud and <598 with
him. And for the <44 of <7179 hours did the Lord talk with the
<27 of <27 and chastened him <819 he remembered not to call
upon the name of the <510

2:15 And the <25 of <133 <6371 of the evil <127 he had <9182
and did call upon the name of the Lord for his <151 who were with
him. And the Lord said unto him: I will forgive thee and thy <18
of <150 sins; but thou <1003 not sin any more, for ye <252 <2079
that my <7796 will not always <7792 with man; wherefore, if ye will
sin <317 ye are <7882 ripe ye <24 be cut off from the <3312 of
the <96 And <2176 are my thoughts upon the land <91 I <21 give
you for your inheritance; for it <9 be a land <319 <439 all <302
<235

2:16 And the Lord said: Go to work and build, <904 the <817 of
barges <40 ye have <358 built. And it came to pass that the
<151 of <151 did go to work, and also his <2237 and <4416
<28 <34 the <34 <31 they had built, <1238 to the
instructions of the <91 And they were small, and they were <5340 upon
the <6029 even like unto the lightness of a fowl upon the water.

2:17 And they were <48 <46 a <46 that they were <8936
tight, even that they <717 hold water like unto a dish; and the bottom
<5418 was tight like unto a <11 and the sides <10 were <10
like unto a <11 and the ends <11 were peaked; and the top <6
was <18 like unto a <17 and the length <11 was the <4 of a
tree; and the door thereof, when it was shut, was <25 like unto a
dish.

2:18 And it came to pass that the <156 of <156 <1141 unto the <1407
<1477 O <4 I have performed the work <154 thou hast <934 me,
and I have made the <169 <162 as thou hast <864 me.

2:19 And <488 O <31 in them <943 is no <5452 <914 <247 we
steer? And also we <7 perish, for in them we <5152 breathe, save it
is the air <54 is in <3018 <1657 we <20 <2913

2:20 And the Lord said unto the <88 of Jared: <608 thou <352
make a hole in the top, and also in the bottom; and when thou <16
<925 for air thou <6 unstop the hole and <1517 air. And if it be
so that the <211 come in upon <1318 <96 ye <61 stop the hole,
that ye may not perish in the flood.

2:21 And it came to pass that the <73 of <161 did so, <138 as
the Lord had commanded.

2:22 And he <176 <542 unto the Lord <176 O <145 <891 I have
done even as thou hast <177 me; and I have <2633 the vessels
for my <1898 and <22 <166 is no <332 in <877 <125 O <32
wilt thou <111 that we <88 <1062 this <658 <99 in darkness?

2:23 And the Lord said unto the <81 of <154 What will ye that I
<967 do that ye may have <44 in your vessels? For <127 ye <202
have windows, for they will be dashed in pieces; <2871 <51 ye take
fire with you, for ye <9 not go by the <33 of <5596

2:24 For <36 ye <15 be as a whale in the midst of the sea; for
the mountain waves <16 dash upon you. Nevertheless, I will <762 you
up <147 out of the depths of the sea; for the winds have gone <774
out of my mouth, and also the rains and the floods have I sent <5283

2:25 And <64 I <1403 you <3244 <583 <5690 for ye <107
<147 this <147 deep save I <15 you <15 the <68 of the sea,
and the <53 <321 have gone <3870 and the <45 <7 <83 <8767
<2526 what will ye that I <157 <30 for you that ye may have
<127 when ye are <6837 up in the <94 of the sea?

<1564 <1564 3

3:1 And it came to pass that the <204 of <778 (now the <9792 of
the <252 <58 had been <258 was eight) went <123 unto the
mount, <12 they <879 the mount Shelem, <800 of its <9543
height, and did molten out of a rock sixteen <3961 stones; and they
were white and clear, even as transparent glass; and he did <1503 them
in his <3450 upon the top of the <48 and <338 <191 unto the <303
<339

3:2 O <8 thou hast said that we must be encompassed <8093 by the
floods. Now <182 O <17 and do not be <9818 with thy servant
<82 of his weakness <1443 thee; for we know that thou art holy and
dwellest in the heavens, and that we are unworthy <20 <20 <26
of the fall our natures have <4960 evil continually; nevertheless, O
<50 thou hast <6054 us a <6114 that we must call upon <474
that from thee we may <495 <450 to our desires.

3:3 <408 O <30 thou hast <5870 us <49 of our iniquity, and
hast <8510 us <246 and for <276 many <1013 we have been in the
wilderness; <60 thou hast been merciful unto us. O <35 look
upon me in pity, and turn away thine <2210 from this thy <469 and
<457 not that they <284 go <222 across this raging deep in
darkness; but <485 <52 <1163 <229 I have <218 out of the rock.

3:4 And I know, O <52 that thou hast all <8485 and can do <1232
thou wilt for the benefit of man; <657 touch <38 stones, O <23
with thy finger, and <333 them that they may <6121 <63 in
<59 and they <71 <8 <8 unto us in the <306 <65 we
have prepared, that we may have <354 while we <20 <402 the sea.

3:5 <158 O <48 thou canst do this. We know that thou art able to
show <42 <424 <82 <39 looks <315 unto the understanding of
men.

3:6 And it came to pass that when the <376 of <661 had said <94
<3741 <286 the Lord stretched <36 his hand and touched the stones
one by one with his finger. And the veil was <3129 from off the eyes of
the <38 of <414 and he saw the finger of the <4401 and it was as
the <10 of a man, like unto flesh and blood; and the <28 of
<67 fell down <314 the <112 for he was struck with fear.

3:7 And the Lord saw that the <25 of <24 had <7925 to the <2593
and the Lord said unto him: Arise, why hast thou fallen?

3:8 And he <6154 unto the Lord: I saw the <69 of the <53 and I
feared lest he <548 smite me; for I knew not that the Lord had <84
and blood.

3:9 And the Lord said unto him: Because of thy <3293 thou hast seen
that I <217 take upon me <28 and <112 and <1897 has man come
<110 me with such <531 <25 as thou hast; for were it not so ye
<3505 not have seen my <178 Sawest thou more than this?

3:10 And he answered: Nay; <90 show thyself unto me.

3:11 And the Lord said unto him: Believest thou the <3877 <257 I <69
speak?

3:12 And he <32 Yea, <32 I know that thou speakest the truth,
for thou art a God of <8 and <302 not lie.

3:13 And when he had said <273 <272 <272 the Lord showed himself
unto him, and <1292 <131 thou knowest <15 <420 ye are <4581
from the <6931 <393 ye are <4665 back into my presence;
<9 I show myself unto you.

3:14 <361 I am he who was <690 from the foundation of the world
to redeem my <1930 <18 I am <1639 <3468 I am the <3500 and the
Son. In me <116 all mankind have <5417 and that eternally, even they
who <12 <4115 on my name; and they <7 <606 my sons and my
daughters.

3:15 And <209 have I <106 <76 unto man whom I have created, for
<13 has man believed in me as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are
<4498 <1332 mine own image? Yea, even all men were <10 in the
beginning <14 mine own image.

3:16 <98 this body, <204 ye now <163 is the body of my spirit;
and man have I <31 <27 the body of my <12 and even as I
appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I <10 unto my <2964 in
the flesh.

3:17 And now, as I, <3561 said I <298 not make a full <3387 of
<211 <211 <66 are <3747 <198 it sufficeth me to say that
<175 <129 <235 unto this man in the spirit, even <71 the <1444
and in the likeness of the same body even as he <24 <24 unto the
<7164

3:18 And he <6998 unto him even as he <6 unto the
Nephites; and all <4044 that this man <5932 know that he was God,
<769 of the many <605 <4251 <78 the Lord had <46 unto him.

3:19 And <18 of the <3797 of this man he <108 not be kept from
beholding within the veil; and he saw the <494 of <5281 <2454 when
he saw, he fell with fear; for he knew that it was the <19 of the
<593 and he had <458 no longer, for he knew, nothing doubting.

3:20 Wherefore, <5306 this <10933 <62 of God, he <61 not be
kept from <60 the <60 <165 he saw Jesus; and he did minister
unto him.

3:21 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto the <609 of <1280
<267 thou <1413 not <851 <205 <205 <127 ye have seen and <6253
to go <708 unto the <3709 <1780 the time <2125 that I <357 glorify
my name in the flesh; <1800 ye <10 treasure up the <34 <34
ye have seen and heard, and show it to no man.

3:22 And <320 when ye <26 come unto me, ye <5 <3714 them and
<5 seal them up, that no one can interpret <1534 for ye <12 <17
them in a <3192 that they <1248 be read.

3:23 And <42 <97 two <790 will I give unto <1027 and ye <28
seal them up also with the <80 <80 ye <11 write.

3:24 For <29 the <42 <12 ye <12 <51 I have confounded;
<2294 I will <5861 in my own due time that <49 <48 <18
magnify to the eyes of men <10 <42 <30 ye <12 <42

3:25 And when the Lord had said <16 <603 he <296 unto the <187

that <1810 be; and he withheld them not from his sight, even unto the
ends of the <2897

3:26 For he had said unto him in <4542 before, that if he <34 <573

also hath <13 that I <12 seal up the <4549 thereof;
<458 I have sealed up the interpreters, <1516 to the
<1534 of the <2266

4:6 For the Lord said unto me: They <460 not go <612 unto the
<8410 <199 the day that they <13 <8640 of <2430 <1534 and

4:8 And he that will contend <1887 the word of the <79 let him be
accursed; and he that <96 deny <235 things, let him be <11 for
unto them will I show no <233 <14 <66 <65 <278 for I am
he who speaketh.

4:9 And at my <8812 the <73 are opened and are shut; and at my
word the <613 <50 <7326 and at my <20 the <624 <2374

4:10 And he that <5351 not my <1303 <4 not my disciples; and
if it so be that I do not speak, judge ye; for ye <38 know that it is
I that speaketh, at the last day.

all his <11986 and said unto <1916 Will ye swear unto me that ye
will be <3245 unto me in the <1326 <242 I <151 <165 of you?

8:14 And it came to pass that they all sware unto him, by the God of
<6631 and also by the <5573 and also by the <3345 and by <258
heads, that <6911 <786 vary from the assistance <49 <82 <143

made <11754 unto <774 the same <12 lose his <430

8:15 And it came to pass that thus they did agree with Akish. And <29
did administer unto them the oaths <51 were <5619 by them of old who
also sought <5427 <12 had been <8761 down even from Cain, who was a
murderer from the beginning.

8:16 And they were kept up by the <888 of the devil to <49
<2900 <48 unto the <710 to keep them in <2991 to help such as
<51 <23 to gain <54 and to murder, and to plunder, and to lie,
and to commit all <2980 of <1015 and whoredoms.

8:17 And it was the <299 of <220 who put it into his <533 to
search up <60 <865 of old; and <16 put it into the <15 of
<335 <335 <129 administered it unto his kindred and <7876
leading them away by fair <11456 to do <177 <177 he <13940

8:18 And it came to pass that they formed a <473 combination, even as
they of old; <151 combination is most abominable and <10954 <2701 all,
in the sight of God;

8:19 For the Lord worketh not in <33 combinations, <2104 doth he
will that man <226 shed <12923 but in all <96 hath <3460 it,
from the <5176 of man.

8:20 And now I, <3249 do not <4347 the <145 of <288 <181 and
<42 for it hath been made <271 unto me that they are had
<814 all <197 and they are had <7 the <13997

8:21 And they have <1300 the <12280 of this <1086 of whom I am
now speaking, and also the <14 of the <14 of <12040

8:22 And <151 <7015 <389 <11146 such <106 <64 to
get <237 and <10711 <955 they <13 <1687 over the nation, <599
they <8 be destroyed; for the Lord will not <5006 that the <8946 of
his saints, <165 <17 be shed by <365 <5 <6795 cry unto him from
the ground for <10701 upon them and yet he avenge them not.

8:23 <1479 O ye <4033 it is <3609 in God that <261 <165
<173 be <3527 unto you, that <3271 ye may <1196 of your sins, and
<65 not that <21 murderous <11431 <57 get <223 you, <67
are <6710 up to get <103 and gain—and the <3568 yea, even the work of
<135 come upon you, yea, even the <10779 of the <13277 of the
<13298 God <38 fall upon you, to your <15616 and <24 if

8:24 <94 the Lord <11952 you, when ye <17 see <17 <17
come <212 you that ye <10 awake to a sense of your <4057 situation,
<923 of this <187 <318 <88 <16 be <22 you; or wo be
unto it, <16 of the <174 of them who have been slain; for they cry
from the dust for <168 upon it, and also upon <1390 who <122 it
up.

8:25 For it <4281 to pass that <576 buildeth it up seeketh to
<106 the freedom of all <7543 nations, and countries; and it
<10278 to pass the <120 of all <313 for it is <44 up by
the devil, who is the <873 of all lies; even that same liar who
beguiled our <1817 parents, yea, even that same liar who hath <332
man to <520 <12567 from the beginning; who hath hardened the <16499
of men that they have murdered the <1507 and stoned <286 and cast
them out from the <600

8:26 <181 I, <414 am <2595 to <415 <179 <179 that evil
may be done <4519 and that the time may come that Satan may have no
<258 upon the <56 of the <4956 of men, but that they may be
<15080 to do good <3214 that they may come unto the fountain
of all <1420 and be <13442

<1420 <1420 9

9:1 And now I, <73 <3736 with my <4502 <4128 <404 it
came to pass that <226 of the <242 <334 of <605 and his
<602 <18 they did <193 the <1125 of <8721

9:2 <6639 the Lord was <6306 unto <1457 and also to his sons
and to his <1330 who did not seek his destruction.

9:3 And the Lord warned Omer in a dream that he <410 <10122 out of
the <1524 <1054 Omer <13862 out of the land with his family, and
traveled many <2579 and came over and <12878 by the hill of <15982 and
came over by the <7438 <2425 the <13082 were destroyed, and from
thence eastward, and came to a <15 <351 was <1842 Ablom, by the
seashore, and <1174 he <7476 his tent, and also his sons and his
<2534 and all his household, save it were <752 and his family.

9:4 And it came to pass that <14 was <2777 king over the <323

9:5 And it came to pass that <15 <849 the life of his
father-in-law; and he applied unto <403 whom he had <7903 by the oath
of the ancients, and they <2381 the head of his father-in-law, as he
sat upon his throne, giving audience to his <2207

9:6 For so <1270 had been the spreading of this <797 and <245
society that it had corrupted the <313 of all the <3125 <2395

9:7 And it came to pass that <15 <1809 to be jealous of his son,
<33 he shut him up in prison, and kept him upon little or no food
<728 he had suffered <10696

9:8 And now the <2495 of him that <13 <2215 (and his name was
Nimrah) was <1610 with his <485 <339 of that <228 his <6 had
done unto his <4088

9:9 And it came to pass that Nimrah <1213 <2738 a <6498 <3233 of
men, and fled out of the <1947 and came over and <1777 with <364

9:10 And it came to pass that <108 <1688 <7522 sons, and they won the
<146 of the <242 notwithstanding they had <204 unto him to do all
<911 of <7949 <2103 to that <80 he <1003

9:11 Now the <870 of <40 were desirous for <856 even as <7 was
<8 for power; <1046 the sons of <10 did <16688 them <11741
by <35 <2627 they drew away the more part of the <36 <2660 <2076

9:12 And <352 <190 to be a war between the sons of <35 and <1415
<32 lasted for the <7772 of many years, yea, unto the <663 of
nearly all the <39 of the <1667 yea, even all, save it were
<2943 souls, and they who fled with the <1372 of <145

9:13 <620 Omer was <2697 <2056 to the land of his <8871

9:14 And it came to pass that Omer <78 to be old; <6841 in
his old age he <171 Emer; and he <410 Emer to be king to <2247 in
his <305

9:15 And <117 that he had <20 Emer to be king he saw peace in the
land for the <110 of two <110 and he <3188 <3492 seen <1707
many <534 <127 were full of sorrow. And it came to pass that Emer did
<55 in his stead, and did fill the steps of his <1747

9:16 And the Lord <95 <114 to take the <2297 from off the <283 and
the <137 of Emer did <2187 <55 <2478 the <40 of <106 and
in the <74 of <16890 and two <3105 they had <2772 <19 <2935
<1604 that they <1860 <7 rich—

9:17 Having all <285 of fruit, and of grain, and of silks, and of
fine linen, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious <7292

9:18 And also all <31 of cattle, of oxen, and cows, and of sheep,
and of swine, and of goats, and also many <357 kinds of animals <140

9:19 And they also had horses, and asses, and <302 were elephants and
cureloms and cumoms; all of <31 were <30 unto man, and more
especially the <18 and <17 and cumoms.

9:20 And thus the Lord did pour out his <16118 upon this <159 <31

<6854 I will pour out the <8342 of my wrath.

9:21 And Emer did <2330 <2330 in <910 all his <268 and
he <322 many sons and <3374 and he <7 Coriantum, and he

of Righteousness, and did rejoice and <2091 in his day; and he died in
peace.

9:23 And it came to pass that <52 did walk in the <334 of his

the <108 who <82 of the <146 of the <100 <143 be

the <150 and that <30 <14 be a <19 <50 <3724 <3592
such an one as <540 had been upon the face of the <617 and <197
bones <25 <2826 as <698 of <697 upon the face of the land <224
they <15 <1983 of <21 <215

11:7 And they hearkened not unto the voice of the <236 <1311 of

contentions in all the <87 and also many famines and pestilences,
<1494 that <21 was a <87 destruction, such an one as <84 had
been <4068 upon the face of the <783 and all this came to pass in the
days of Shiblom.

11:8 And the <168 <59 to <87 of <68 <2763 and inasmuch as
they did the Lord did have mercy on <282

11:9 And it came to pass that <212 was slain, and Seth was <1875
into <583 and did <7707 in <527 all his <287

11:10 And it came to pass that Ahah, his son, did <1208 the <1974
and he did <1326 over the <72 all his <28 And he did do all <455
of <3276 in his <2814 by <510 he did <1687 the <17150 of much
<9647 and few were his <28

11:11 And Ethem, <1611 a <1611 of <56 did <54 the <54
and he also did do that <37 was <190 in his <28

11:12 And it came to pass that in the days of <12690 <185 came many
<474 and <327 <521 unto the <1638 yea, they did prophesy
that the Lord <1848 utterly <433 them from off the face of the <271
<266 they <5851 of <177 iniquities.

11:13 And it came to pass that the <123 <3921 <15 <15145 and
<35 not <13572 unto <8 words; and the <385 mourned and
withdrew from <335 the <2154

11:14 And it came to pass that <82 did <2963 <2963 in <2702
all his <717 and he <466 <5757 And it came to pass that <6222 did
<182 in his <2771 and <8 did that <133 was <133 <2302 the

11:15 And it came to pass that <129 arose a <1513 <65 the
<412 <350 of that <2742 <4136 <30 was <1209 up to get
<707 and <16339 and <24 <24 a <1099 man <25 them in <8686
and gave <749 unto <6251 in <27 he did <3915 the half of the
<207 and he did <19638 the half of the <781 for many <1500

11:16 And it came to pass that <92 did <31 him, and did <238
the <23 again.

11:17 And it came to pass that <69 <69 another <69 man; and he
was a <267 of the <566 of <5247

11:18 And it came to pass that he did <47 <50 and <46 the
<78 <464 <7 <891 in <364 all the <654 of his
<178 and he <178 <12990

11:19 And it came to pass that <12996 <25 in <25 all his
<306

11:20 And in the days of <17 <79 also came many <301 and
<302 of <492 and <8353 <7861 and <10491 <2864 unto the
<184 and <291 they <556 <469 the Lord God <275 <247
<248 <691 them to <278 utter destruction;

11:21 And that the Lord God <19 send or <1724 <1986 <129 <306 to
<3277 the <554 by his <4774 <886 the <431 by <198 he <480
<35 <6656

11:22 And they did reject all the <2876 of the <81 <250 of
<19 <251 <3899 and <280 <2115

11:23 And it came to pass that <106 <136 <13133 and he <2336
<3560 <130 in <130 all his <129

<910 <910 12

12:1 And it came to pass that the days of <16 were in the days of
<5487 and Coriantumr was king over all the <797

12:2 And <21 was a prophet of the <1728 <1415 <8 came <118 in
the days of Coriantumr, and <624 to <466 unto the <163 for he
<1286 not be restrained <104 of the <8757 of the Lord <131 was in
him.

12:3 For he did cry from the morning, even <2748 the going down of the
sun, exhorting the <171 to <8370 in God unto <215 lest they
<211 be <4191 <6644 unto them that by <9048 all <2006 are
fulfilled—

12:4 <3778 <2343 <8410 in God <1449 with <8229 hope for a
better <9714 yea, even a <1622 at the <1841 hand of God, <79 hope
<4527 of <16288 maketh an anchor to the <15187 of men, <14 <244 make
them sure and steadfast, <4741 abounding in good works, <641 led to
<9748 God.

12:5 And it came to pass that <152 did <142 <313 and <313
<82 unto the <147 <40 they did not believe, <145 they saw
them not.

12:6 And now, I, <4419 <58 <13979 <17964 <5456 <3114 <1054
I <8 show unto the <8260 that <121 is <39 <36 are hoped for
and not <9450 <418 dispute not <42 ye see not, for ye <8603
no witness <173 <326 the trial of your faith.

12:7 For it was by <39 that <9423 <9421 <1783 unto our <2775
<23 he had <17845 from the <14037 and he <15 not <16 unto them
<39 <16 they had <28 in him; <59 it must needs be that
some had <12 in him, for he <27 <26 not unto the <5651

12:8 But <81 of the <19 of men he has <4872 <19 unto the
<206 and glorified the name of the <8397 and <8160 a way that
<4887 <13190 <230 be partakers of the heavenly gift, that they <9
hope for <4357 <136 <136 they have not seen.

12:9 <259 ye may also have <20373 and be <30 of the <29 if
ye will but have <136

12:10 <14871 it was by <77 that they of old were <3201 <118 the
holy <8592 of God.

12:11 <45 by <20 was the law of Moses given. But in the gift
of his Son hath God <95 a more excellent way; and it is by <26
that it hath been <16093

12:12 For if <597 be no <16 <744 the <3653 of men God can do no
<14890 <11 <7933 <181 he <169 not <151 <193 <75 <532
<94

12:13 <5739 it was the <32 of Alma and Amulek that <1267 the
<6562 to <16616 to the <3350

12:14 <23 it was the <23 of Nephi and Lehi that <2701 the
change upon the <9646 that they were <8834 with fire and with
the Holy Ghost.

12:15 <33 it was the <33 of Ammon and his <6731 <192 <34
so <376 a <89 <89 the <5227

12:16 Yea, and even all they who <19 <14849 <2 them by
<439 even <222 who were <911 <322 and also <7 who were after.

12:17 And it was by <53 that the <7272 <14783 <1606 a <14815
that they <518 not taste of <1366 and they <13 not the <14
<145 <145 <145 <144

12:18 And <5361 at any time hath any <63 <65 <17 <17
<18 <14115 <620 they <4981 <3586 in the Son of God.

12:19 And <203 were many <3116 <63 was so <1457 <4179 even
<86 <86 <8168 who <629 not be kept from <10321 the veil, but
<9843 saw with <44 eyes the <330 <138 they had <18924 with an eye
of <121 and they were glad.

12:20 And <1859 we have seen in this <5978 that one of <508 was the
<931 of <6342 for so <172 was his <69 in God, that when God put
<712 his <10418 he <70 not hide it from the <2316 of the <29 of
<7584 <440 of his word <70 he had <1969 unto him, <6 word he
had <154 by <148

12:21 And <139 the <29 of <3271 had <92 the <46 of the <1447
<36 of the <175 <30 the <17 of <17 had <31 by
<106 the Lord <65 not <10161 <10161 from his sight; <171
he <344 him all <951 for he <16 no <15971 be kept <19909 the
veil.

12:22 And it is by <110 that my <6104 have <44 the <53 that
<132 <163 <243 come unto <170 <306 <14304 the <19874
<4768 the Lord hath <4238 me, yea, even <9705 <10842

12:23 And I said unto him: <91 the <9861 will mock at <36
<68 <98 of our <11470 in writing; for Lord thou hast made us
<1121 in word by <102 but thou hast not made us <11 in <21
for thou hast made all this <842 that they <103 <720 much, <40
of the Holy <8989 <140 thou hast <5857 <469

12:24 And thou hast made us that we <25 <5235 but little, <26 of
the awkwardness of our hands. <422 thou hast not made us <56 in
writing like unto the <179 of <224 for thou madest him that the
<135 <52 he <14163 were <22 even as thou art, unto the
overpowering of man to read <1576

12:25 Thou hast also made our <1075 powerful and <15625 even that we
<10540 <71 <85 <554 when we <5 we <9271 our weakness, and
stumble <81 of the placing of our <1427 and I fear lest the
<167 <5487 mock at our <13802

12:26 And when I had said <10812 the Lord <13679 unto me, <11684 Fools
mock, but they <26 mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek,
that they <13 take no <19759 of your weakness;

12:27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them <256 weakness. I
give unto men <226 that they may be humble; and my <46 is
<47 for all men that <8515 <2468 <468 me; for if they
<8 <8 <8 me, and have <308 in me, then will I make
weak <171 <1848 <8354 unto <157

12:28 <203 I will show unto the <123 <62 <56 and I will
show unto them that <277 hope and charity <5555 unto me—the
<5426 of all righteousness.

12:29 And I, <996 <1233 <10802 <318 <6780 was comforted, and <11235
O <332 thy <3716 will be <7561 for I know that thou workest unto
the <767 of men <4132 to <59 <591

12:30 For the <264 of <443 said unto the <8923 Zerin, Remove—and
it was removed. And if he had not had <111 it <1047 not have moved;
<452 thou <45 <491 men have <500

12:31 For thus didst thou <9656 <11378 unto thy <10058 for
<19 they had <108 and did <367 in thy <9756 thou <20 show
<20 unto them in <579 power.

12:32 And I also <3830 that thou hast said that thou hast <891 a
<4865 for man, yea, even <773 the mansions of thy <1001 in <351 man
<988 have a more <910 hope; <81 man must <977 or he <331
<1115 an inheritance in the <1234 <23 thou hast prepared.

12:33 And <3981 I <57 that thou hast said that thou hast loved
the <1055 even unto the laying down of thy life for the <11 that
thou mightest take it <1838 to <4389 a <45 for the <181 of men.

12:34 And now I know that this love <61 thou hast had for the
<21 of men is charity; <409 <1557 men <348 have <253
they <89 inherit that <40 <24 thou hast <126 in the <119
of thy <20576

12:35 <1048 I know by this <6248 <21 thou hast said, that if the
<303 have not charity, <443 of our <450 that thou wilt
prove <2198 and take away <260 talent, yea, even that <30 they have
<10778 and give unto them who <70 have more abundantly.

12:36 And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he <267
give unto the <58 grace, that they <196 have charity.

12:37 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: If they have not
<121 it <17343 not unto <11067 thou hast been faithful; <136
thy <15121 <67 be made clean. And <100 thou hast seen thy
<411 thou <11196 be made <925 even unto the sitting down in the
<154 <103 I have <154 in the <154 of my <153

12:38 And now I, <416 bid farewell unto the <6183 yea, and also
unto my <773 whom I love, <995 we <61 meet <493 the
<19494 of <10542 <3138 all men <11 know that my <77 are
not spotted with your <11824

12:39 And then <18 ye know that I have seen <9686 and that he hath
<13164 with me face to face, and that he told me in plain humility,
even as a man telleth <1788 in mine own <15274 <1493 <499
<1494

12:40 And only a few have I <15309 <138 of my <135 in writing.

12:41 And now, I <202 commend you to seek this <867 of whom the
<2123 and apostles have <29 that the <622 of God the <416
and also the Lord <22 <117 and the Holy <19036 <164 beareth
<1053 of <281 may be and abide in you forever. <9741

<1605 <1802 13

13:1 And now I, <174 <6005 to <19024 my <29 <95 the
<2512 of the <880 of whom I have been <87

13:2 For <1107 they <2690 all the <806 of Ether; for he <1143
told them of all <943 from the <6545 of man; and that <551 the
<9440 had receded from off the face of this land it <3372 a <3070
land <3072 all <4951 <3073 a chosen land of the <1845 <521 the
Lord <142 have that all men <1025 <3649 him who <2430 upon the face
<9767

13:3 And that it was the <297 of the New Jerusalem, <137 <25 come
down out of <6903 and the holy sanctuary of the <2241

13:4 <754 <140 saw the days of <167 and he <862 <133 a
New Jerusalem upon this <1927

13:5 And he <15 also <16 the <622 of <10513 and the

<5 be <2268 up <600 a holy city unto the <109 <407 it
<1029 not be a new <31 for it had been in a time of old; but it
<32 be <32 up <32 and <846 a holy city of the <34 and it
<16 be <16 unto the <71 of <10449

13:6 And that a New <45 <17 be <17 upon this <2121 unto the
<19356 of the seed of Joseph, for <146 <891 <1392 has been a type.

13:7 For as Joseph <2136 his <3923 down into the land of Egypt, even
so he died there; <99 the Lord <18 a <41 of the seed of
<27 out of the land of <193 that he <559 be <6272 unto the
seed of <17 that they <76 <4770 not, even as he was <16
unto the <55 of <16 that he <16 <16 not.

13:8 <669 the <51 of the <116 of <17 <474 be <107 upon
this <3122 and it <9 be a land of <660 <8305 and they <9

13:9 And <147 <9 be a new <16616 and a new <2815 and they <11 be
like unto the old save the old have <3817 <3845 and all <175 have
<222 new.

13:10 And then <2098 the New Jerusalem; and <3078 are they who <362
therein, for it is they <1590 <601 are <12896 <1397 the <6680 of
the Lamb; and they are they who are <9326 <937 the <138 of the
seed of <231 who were of the <146 of <262

13:11 And then also <57 the <124 of old; and the <5168
<13460 <62 are <3538 for they have been washed in the <55 of
the <55 and they are they who were <15139 and <4411 in from the
four quarters of the <3029 and from the <4938 <4938 and are
<1966 of the <21614 of the <10786 <302 God made with <201
<4117 Abraham.

13:12 And when <660 <141 <14050 <1179 to pass the <18736 <22
saith, <178 are they who were first, who <173 be last; and <11 are
they who were last, who <12 be first.

13:13 And I was <7820 to <1377 <5145 but I am forbidden; but <1106 and
<2234 were the <18650 of <598 but they esteemed him as
naught, and cast him out; and he hid <1960 in the cavity of a rock by
day, and by <8523 he went <1712 viewing the <89 <83 <332 come

13:14 And as he <2498 in the <33 of a rock he made the <2658 of
his <15792 <32 the destructions <32 came upon the <2304 by

13:15 And it came to pass that in that same year in <23 he was cast
out from <248 the <715 <134 <2486 to be a <112 war <10 the

13:16 And now <2533 <1364 studied, himself, in all the arts of
war and all the <8155 of the <1188 <715 he gave <2865 unto
them who <48 to <48 him.

13:17 But he <3012 not, <1973 his fair sons nor <3793 <6
the fair sons and <4413 of Cohor; <9 the fair sons and
<9 of Corihor; and in fine, <99 were none of the fair sons and
<15 upon the face of the <4114 <460 who <47 of <102 <18364

13:18 <526 it came to pass that in the <2019 year that <746
<201 in the <201 of a rock, <46 were many <161 who were <8107 by
the <7187 of <2102 <140 <7316 fighting <2803 <147

kept the hilt of his <68 in his <3190 hand, in the defence of his
property and his own life and of his <5667 and children.

14:3 And now, <1505 the <169 of two <169 and <7 the <5118 of

were drunken.

14:6 And he came <29 to the land of <3762 and <9544 <1053 upon
the <9544 of <661

14:7 And it came to pass that <69 <837 with his army in the
<57 for the <170 of two <170 in <149 he did <706 <253
<9969 to his army.

14:8 Now the <91 of <183 <1290 name was Gilead, also <11556
<22 <21 to his army, <324 of <865 combinations.

14:9 And it came to pass that his high priest <7505 him as he sat
upon his throne.

14:10 And it came to pass that one of the <37 <7789 <24

name was Lib; and Lib was a man of <71 stature, more than any <1763
man <1100 all the <1169

14:11 And it came to pass that in the <978 year of Lib, <141
came up unto the land of <169 and gave <243 unto Lib.

14:12 And it came to pass that he <608 with Lib, in <154 Lib did
<13859 upon his arm that he was wounded; <4629 the army of
<46 did press <24159 upon Lib, that he fled to the <24606 upon
the seashore.

14:13 And it came to pass that <26 pursued him; and Lib gave
<68 unto him upon the <23

14:14 And it came to pass that Lib did <64 the army of <280
that they fled <578 to the <242 of <371

14:15 And it came to pass that Lib did <391 him <685 he came to the
<686 of Agosh. And <64 had <4930 all the <601 with him as he
fled <924 Lib in that <15836 of the land <546 he fled.

14:16 And when he had come to the <38 of Agosh he gave <96 unto
Lib, and he smote upon him <58 he died; <146 the <298 of
Lib did come <777 <60 in the <5010 <1546 and the <28
<436 <436 <435 in the <181 <15 fled <107 <66 the
army of the <31 of Lib.

14:17 Now the name of the <12 of Lib was <3481 Shiz. And it came
to pass that Shiz <173 <542 <147 and he did <4092 many
<5838 and he did slay both <24065 and <11757 and he did burn the
cities.

14:18 And <564 went a fear of Shiz <9704 all the <1787 yea, a cry
went <457 <10 the land—Who can <11913 <83 the army of Shiz?
<2029 he sweepeth the <1307 <11 him!

14:19 And it came to pass that the <180 <750 to flock <6057 in
<23999 <37 all the face of the <702

14:20 And they were <9978 and a part of them fled to the army of
Shiz, and a part of them fled to the army of <518

14:21 And so <401 and lasting had been the war, and so long had been
the <23705 of bloodshed and carnage, that the <1395 face of the land was
<5509 with the <21924 of the <20041

14:22 And so swift and speedy was the war that <145 was none left to
bury the <21612 but they did <629 <143 from the <888 of <1774 to
the <6 of <895 leaving the <44 of both men, <11948 and
<2672 strewed upon the face of the <1143 to <1884 a prey to the
worms of the <13950

14:23 And the scent <12924 went <49 upon the face of the <27 even
upon all the face of the <213 <1562 the <180 <297 troubled by
day and by <697 <604 of the <33 <17723

14:24 <8343 Shiz did not <11663 to <401 <1269 for he had
<7969 to <8750 <577 upon <325 of the <100 of his <9655
who had been <4752 and the word of the Lord <344 came to <995 that
<24 <966 not fall by the <787

14:25 And thus we see that the Lord did <12951 them in the <7564 of
his wrath, and <1289 <1244 and <19572 had <2637 a way for
<10 <15991 <8403

14:26 And it came to pass that Shiz did <89 <55 <8355

14:28 And they <8423 <103 <15879 in the <1209 of <1728 and
<96 <11 his <11 in the <11 of Shurr. Now the <5 of
Shurr was near the hill Comnor; <2301 <21 did <11538 his
<69 <413 upon the hill Comnor, and did sound a trumpet unto the
<14 of Shiz to invite them <274 to <23150

14:29 And it came to pass that they came <11854 but were <6536 <20817
and they came the <1700 <17701 and they were <12 <575 the <8
<23827 And it came to pass that they came <13 the <1536 <21 and the

14:30 And it came to pass that Shiz <642 upon <93 that he gave
him many deep wounds; and <587 <1916 lost his <394 fainted,
and was <10603 away as <18261 he were <443

14:31 Now the loss of men, <599 and <407 on both <15711 was so
<496 that Shiz <3653 his <217 that they <316 not <265 the
<131 of <213 <154 they <10918 to <187 camp.

15:1 And it came to pass when <82 had recovered of his wounds,
he <252 to <3191 the <2745 <366 <27 had <1765 unto him.

15:2 He saw that <307 had been <1900 by the <1269 <23761 <8285 two
millions of his <1358 and he <35 to <24068 in his heart; yea, <24
had been <25 two <19 of <2072 men, and also <80 <1281 and

15:3 He <30 to <4747 of the evil <66 he had <10889 he <11 to

15:4 And it came to pass that he <3699 an <23480 unto <691 desiring
him that he <361 <1933 the <108 and he <6 give up the <1765

<17 the <11 of <288 <288 the <5 of Shiz did
give <373 unto the <9 of <820

15:7 And when <48 saw that he was <2441 to fall he fled <402

1:2 For <373 <377 wars are <1226 fierce <1862 themselves; and

7:4 And now my <1175 I <15418 <1057 <4976 of you <90 of your
<54 walk with the <2220 of men.

7:5 For I <615 the word of God, <59 <10799 by <268 <17190 ye <48
know <345 for if <9 <9 be good, then they are good <14250

7:6 For <1329 God hath said a man <2251 evil <6046 do that <37 is
<16148 for if he offereth a <7121 or prayeth unto God, <6070 he <47
do it with real <24582 it profiteth him nothing.

7:7 For <43 it is not <27120 unto him for <6337

7:8 For <14 if a man <55 evil giveth a <45 he <25329 it
grudgingly; <955 it is <27 unto him the same as if he had
retained the gift; <16 he is <16 evil <436 God.

7:9 And likewise also is it <13 evil unto a man, if he <83 pray
and not with real <84 of <2998 yea, and it <88 him <21663
for God <24359 none such.

7:10 <249 a man <78 evil <133 do that <133 is <132 <4324
will he give a good gift.

7:11 For <103 a bitter <6452 <23 <4727 <742 good water;
<23 can a good <11 <10 <10 <15 <10 <1469 a man
<44 a <16073 of the <12547 <25 <10367 <677 and if he <5
<1096 he <10 be a <17 of the devil.

7:12 <74 all <263 <69 are good <5405 of God; and that <8
is evil <9 of the devil; for the <43 is an enemy unto God, and
fighteth <2473 him <11964 and inviteth and enticeth to sin, and
to do that <33 is evil <28284

7:13 But <103 that <11 is of God <25 and <25 to do good
<18301 <98 <1589 <6293 <15 <12 and <12 to do
<298 and to love God, and to <822 him, is inspired of God.

7:14 <94 take heed, my <469 <364 that ye do not <367
that <37 is evil to be of God, or that <9 is good and of God to be
of the <132

7:15 For <80 my <36 it is <1105 unto you to judge, that ye
may know good from evil; and the way to <51 is as plain, that ye may
know with a <17511 <21538 as the daylight is from the dark <5372

7:16 For <48 the <1031 of <198 is <49 to <121 man, that he
may know good from <48 <132 I show unto you the way to <24254
for <21 <142 <96 <142 to do <139 and to persuade to <7828
in <529 is sent <261 by the <702 and gift of <253 <358 ye
may know with a <76 <16515 it is of God.

7:17 But <12575 <43 <16628 men to do evil, and <40 not in
<41 and deny him, and <186 not God, then ye may know with a
<38 <38 it is of the <268 for <698 this <697 doth the
<273 <10195 for he <43 no man to do <87 no, not one; <347
do his angels; <5 do they who <10276 <6864 unto him.

7:18 And now, my <192 <13346 that ye know the <15481 by <123 ye
may <197 <5 <8 is the <3 of <81 see that ye do not <197
wrongfully; for with that same <8161 <20 ye <10 ye <464 also be
judged.

7:19 <279 I beseech of you, <51 that ye <959 <12889
diligently in the <43 of <204 that ye may know good from <198 and
if ye will lay hold upon <195 good thing, and <965 it not, ye
certainly will be a child of <947

7:20 And now, my <50 how is it <2942 that ye can lay hold upon
<35 good thing?

7:21 And now I come to that <868 of <95 I said I <780 speak; and I
will tell you the way <13475 ye may lay hold on <35 good thing.

7:22 For <302 God <26770 all <1937 <515 from <3934 to
everlasting, <11 he sent angels to <1578 unto the <752 of
men, to make <6917 <925 the <25190 of <279 and in <127
<1097 <138 come <46 good <46

7:23 And God also declared unto <3569 by his own <19019 that <23
<22 <18969

7:24 And <54 <31 were <24083 ways that he did <48 <555
unto the <59 of men, <109 were <630 and all <12 <6 are
good <559 of <63 otherwise men were <26215 and <33 <2507 no
good <333 come unto <1434

7:25 <222 by the ministering of angels, and by <82 word <35
proceeded <381 out of the <3653 of God, men <3669 to <17258 <1802 in
<46 and thus by <173 they did lay hold upon <29 good thing; and
thus it was <920 the <131 of <224

7:26 And <362 that he came men also were <2282 by <40 in his <16666
and by <40 they <4248 the sons of God. And as sure as <138 <24553
he <1098 <944 <1108 unto our <8110 <1741 Whatsoever <102 ye
<328 ask the <1756 in my <2069 <94 is <398 in <44 believing that
ye <16 receive, <162 it <4 be done unto you.

7:27 <126 my <625 <296 have <7779 <2971 <986
<53 hath ascended into <6516 and hath sat down on the <1411 hand
of God, to claim of the <55 his rights of <9018 <56 he hath upon
the <200 of men?

7:28 For he hath <21938 the ends of the law, and he claimeth all
<1679 who have <82 in him; and they who have <7 in him will <5198
unto <167 good <167 <567 he advocateth the <8995 of the
<49 of men; and he dwelleth eternally in the heavens.

7:29 And <97 he hath done <7455 my <108 <108 have <108
ceased? <8136 I say unto you, Nay; <531 have <348 <119 to
<350 unto the <42 of men.

7:30 For <150 they are <547 unto him, to <18 <1969 to
the word of his command, showing <560 unto them of <7412 <90
and a firm mind in <90 form of godliness.

7:31 And the office of <1125 ministry is to call men unto <26273
and to fulfill and to do the work of the covenants of the <1282 <169
he hath made unto the <79 of men, to <7222 the way <1469 the
<10 of men, by declaring the word of <219 unto the <6779
<16270 of the <1243 that they may bear <16697 of him.

7:32 And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the residue
of men may have <105 in <643 that the Holy <1461 may have <1382 in
<98 <3217 <133 to the <774 <6809 and <357 this <719
<6335 to pass the <92 the <97 <94 he hath made unto the
<84 of men.

7:33 And <84 hath <1965 If ye will have <53 in me ye <332 have
<43 to do <797 <362 is expedient in me.

7:34 And he hath <28 Repent all ye ends of the <2816 and come unto
me, and be <1892 in my <383 and have <44 in me, that ye may be
<13010

7:35 And now, my <269 <269 if this be the case that <426
<541 are true <95 I have <4160 unto you, and God will show unto
you, with <80 and <3469 <12074 at the last day, that they are true,
and if they are true has the day of <315 <314

7:36 Or have <312 <312 to <18688 unto the <138 of men? Or has
he <18266 the <45 of the Holy <183 from them? Or will he, so long
as time <143 <6487 or the <4928 <5 stand, or <613 <4 be one man
upon the face <4767 to be saved?

7:37 <375 I say unto you, Nay; for it is by <138 that <75 are
wrought; and it is by <10 that <77 <75 and <370 unto men;
<1042 if <135 <134 have <88 wo be unto the <88 of men,
for it is <433 of <23214 and all is vain.

7:38 For no man can be <23100 <274 to the <595 of <291 save
they <88 have <54 in his <627 <49 if <49 <49 have
ceased, then has <13 <54 <14404 and <13439 is the <17498 of man, for
they are as <4511 <120 had been no <23651 made.

7:39 But <466 my <228 <228 I <969 <8901 <40 of you, for
I <8 that ye have <44 in <312 <88 of your meekness; for if
ye have not <13 in him then ye are not fit to be <1898 <429 the
<1899 of his church.

7:40 And <3435 my <53 <53 I <925 <1705 unto you <879
hope. How is it that ye can attain unto <733 save ye <118 have hope?

7:41 And what is it that ye <13 hope for? <206 I say unto you that
ye <11 have hope <2619 the atonement of <88 and the <264 of his
<23778 to be <3220 unto life eternal, and this <103 of your
<97 in him <181 to the promise.

7:42 <743 if a man have <16 he must <8869 have <7818 for
<8339 <9 <164 <1491 be any <93

7:43 And <110 <3328 I say unto you that he <17 have <21 and
<1916 save he <79 be <8112 and lowly of heart.

7:44 If so, his <20 and hope is <28977 for none is acceptable <1646
God, save the meek and <26 in <1628 and if a man be meek and <10
in <17734 and confesses by the <117 of the Holy <381 that <1914 is
the <283 he must <94 have <1980 for if he have not <7704 he
is nothing; <777 he must <16 have <7735

7:45 And <16 suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is
not puffed up, <13678 not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no
<1357 and rejoiceth not in <2196 but <5 in the <19367 <7552
all <1143 <9210 all <3 hopeth all <3 endureth all
<18667

7:46 <181 my <266 <266 if ye have not <7865 ye are
<1742 for <69 <9970 faileth. <17 <867 unto <12
<554 is the greatest of all, for all <342 must fail—

7:47 But <24 is the pure love of <126 and it <55 forever;
and <2266 is <2266 <25595 of it at the last day, it <202 be well
with him.

7:48 <55 my <72 <72 pray unto the <974 with all the
energy of <183 that ye may be <27845 with this <7797 <73 he hath
<15774 upon all who are true <2057 of his Son, <195 <1133 that
ye may <1092 the sons of God; that when he <61 <534 we <3 be
like him, for we <7 see him as he is; that we may have this <315
that we may be purified even as he is pure. <2644

<2246 <2246 8

8:1 An <4097 of my <2238 <2193 <3278 to me, <26231 and it was
<8 unto me soon <823 my <2174 to the ministry. And on this wise
did he <2273 unto me, <1159

8:2 My <133 son, <2285 I <12802 <3392 that your Lord <107
<430 hath been mindful of you, and hath <3136 you to his ministry,
and to his holy <10930

8:3 I am <22 of you <2748 in my <25748 <2560 praying unto
God the <177 in the name of his Holy Child, <7928 that he, <483
his infinite goodness and <8074 will keep you <10 the <3109 of
<408 on his name to the end.

8:4 And now, my son, I <558 unto you <558 that <208 grieveth me
exceedingly; for it <6 me that <479 <1418 disputations rise
<596 you.

8:5 For, if I have learned the <349 <18 have been <19
<18 you <37 the <2738 of your <13574 <5059

8:6 And now, my son, I <14707 that ye <43 <11923 diligently, that
this gross error <8 be removed from <33 you; for, for this <2112
I have <197 this epistle.

8:7 For immediately <202 I had <62 <744 <362 of you I inquired
of the Lord <63 the matter. And the word of the Lord came to me
by the <508 of the Holy <2773 <220

8:8 Listen to the <796 of <387 your Redeemer, your Lord and your
God. <2911 I came into the <9562 not to call the <8571 but
sinners to repentance; the <5752 need no physician, but they that are
sick; <822 <125 <863 are whole, for they are not capable of
committing sin; <547 the <6542 of Adam is <6038 from them in me,
that it hath no <81 over <2371 and the law of circumcision is done
away in me.

8:9 And <129 this <1154 did the Holy <610 <1612 the word of God
unto me; <64 my <326 son, I know that it is solemn mockery
<660 God, that ye <182 baptize <81 <206

8:10 <782 I say unto you that this <1156 <430 ye teach—repentance
and <228 unto <1433 who are accountable and <99 of <98
sin; yea, teach parents that they must <5293 and be <27209 and
<8785 <1361 as <1241 <47 <6023 and they <37 all be <1591
with <11 <11 <58

8:11 And <8 <8 <147 need no <1356 <1422 <3093
<183 <56 is unto <3468 to the <7169 the <3248
unto the <3474 of <3046

8:12 But <29 <29 are alive in <218 even from the <18234
of the <18529 if not so, God is a partial God, and also a changeable
God, and a respecter to persons; for how many <36 <36 have died
<853 baptism!

8:13 <619 if <13 <13 <1757 not be <95 <14 <3067
<311 must have gone to an <24681 <25085

8:14 <159 I say unto you, that he that supposeth that <31 <31
need <104 is in the gall of <25826 and in the <25826 of <2950
for he hath <125 <992 <890 nor <826 <219 <204 he be
cut off <16567 in the thought, he must go down to <57

8:15 For <1114 is the <5874 to <23429 that God saveth one <2009
<980 of <86 and the <6501 must <4326 <8 he hath no
<176

8:16 Wo be unto them that <207 pervert the ways of the Lord <298 this
<29579 for they <13 <30 <2652 they <13107 <202 I <529 with
<30366 <3218 <18148 from God; and I fear not what man can do;
for <2210 love casteth out all <20420

8:17 And I am <767 with <840 <558 is <2018 love;
<116 all <143 are alike unto me; <7 I love <152
<10 with a <36 <18 and they are all <17 and <7882 of
salvation.

8:18 For I know that God is not a <241 God, <162 a <240
being; but he is <24573 from all eternity to all eternity.

8:19 Little <49 <1076 repent; <57 it is <161 <159
to deny the pure <17633 of God unto <3555 for they are all <302 in
him <161 of his <28064

8:20 And he that <2844 that <90 <40 need <241 <25195 the
<33 of <326 and setteth at <29904 the <1195 of him and the
<490 of his redemption.

8:21 Wo unto <13677 for they are in <26608 of <14213 hell, and an
<301 torment. I <185 it <30119 God hath <5834 me. <593 unto
them and give <2574 or they <6421 <2644 you at the <8728 of
<2037

8:22 For <1197 that all <79 <79 are <99 in <75 and also
all they that are <359 the law. For the <76 of <1391 <2137
on all them that have no law; <145 he that is not condemned, or
he that is <12350 no condemnation, <161 <161 and unto such <125
availeth nothing—

8:23 But it is <564 <563 God, denying the <137 of <62 and
the <53 of his Holy <3250 and putting trust in dead works.

8:24 <306 my son, this <573 ought not to be; for <514 is unto
them that are <62 condemnation and <3 the <670 of a <3583 law.

8:25 And the <4119 fruits of <26 is baptism; and <77 <106
by <893 unto the <548 the commandments; and the <5 the
<554 <1821 <552 of <21924

8:26 And the <9 of sins <13 meekness, and lowliness of
<1314 and <255 of meekness and <9 of <3640 <43 the
visitation of the Holy <802 <362 Comforter filleth with hope and
<349 <1137 <9 love <1187 by diligence unto <3544 <2244 the
end <423 <8214 when all the <24084 <6 <8342 with God.

8:27 <126 my son, I will <1064 unto you <4774 if I go not out soon
<244 the <10050 <19 the <26114 of this <15229 or the <1559
of the <27592 hath proven <677 <6333 <471 they <544
<473

8:28 Pray for <360 my son, that <141 may come unto <2367 But
<1634 I fear lest the <2782 hath <1667 <5211 with <826 and in
this part of the land they are also seeking to put down all <226 and
<513 <114 <132 from God; and they are <245 the Holy <4284

8:29 And <548 rejecting so <1881 a <2845 my son, they must <551
soon, unto the <194 of the <7915 <35 were <1912 by the
<2499 as well as the <963 of our Savior <7944

8:30 Farewell, my son, <165 I <157 <145 unto you, or <5 meet you
<10983 <1260

<1260 <1260 9

9:1 My <895 son, I <24 unto you <169 that ye may know that I am
yet alive; but I <16 <10575 of that <70 is grievous.

9:2 For <144 I have had a sore <5973 with the <4550 in <19
we did not conquer; and Archeantus has <4973 by the <4939 and also
Luram and Emron; yea, and we have lost a <130 <14666 of our <8979
men.

9:3 And now <49 my son, I fear lest the <4711 <105 <4708
this <5394 for they do not <8109 and <5410 stirreth them up
<1282 to <6057 one with another.

9:4 <266 I am laboring with them <3127 and when I <540 the
word of God with sharpness they tremble and <29 <291 me; and when
I use no <13 they harden <284 <5453 <13 it; <504 I
fear lest the <265 of the Lord hath <268 <268 with <281

9:5 For so <1388 do they <40 that it seemeth me that they have
no fear of <10337 and they have lost <45 <390 one <13765 <27862
and they thirst <267 <4157 and revenge <3231

9:6 And now, my <213 son, <14773 <24 hardness, let us
<1291 diligently; for if we <359 <6821 to labor, we <5 be <4117
<512 condemnation; for we have a <20 to perform whilst in this
tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the <3305 of all <12868
and rest our <4237 in the <4961 of God.

9:7 And now I <258 <258 <1306 the sufferings of this <5614
For <1904 to the <3082 <249 I have <4091 from Amoron,
<218 the <213 have many prisoners, <13 they took from the
<24268 of Sherrizah; and <1411 were men, <6982 and <1139

9:8 And the <26390 and <10248 of <1188 <5876 and <715 they have
<15518 and they feed the <11 upon the <4532 of <131 husbands, and
the <19 upon the <10 of <10 <28844 and no <18934 save a
<5245 do they give unto <205

9:9 And <161 this <311 abomination of the <342 it
doth not <6269 that of our <535 in Moriantum. For <97 many of
the <8524 of the <103 have they <1347 prisoners; and <208
depriving them of that <111 was most dear and <14661 <9326 all
<1861 <10 is chastity and virtue—

9:10 And <26 they had done this <3106 they did <15528 them in a most
cruel <1061 torturing <95 <7122 even unto <269 and <23 they
have done <2707 they <13916 <14 <112 like unto wild <13925 <692
of the <5769 of <12 <26802 and they do it for a token of bravery.

9:11 O my <282 son, how can a <109 like <39 that are <875
civilization—

9:12 (And only a few <6131 have <9062 <9062 and they were a civil and
a <30429 people)

9:13 But O my son, how can a <41 like <41 <7767 <28961 is in so
much abomination—

9:14 How can we expect that God will stay his hand in <3281 <419
us?

9:15 <461 my <791 cries: Wo unto this <298 Come out in judgment,
O God, and hide <114 <15895 and <8806 and <7122 from
<922 thy face!

9:16 And <2192 my son, <297 are many <26703 and <24 <217 who
<13193 in <310 and that part of the provisions <204 the
<229 did not <16938 <117 <242 the army of Zenephi has <6916
<9 and left them to <5221 <5220 they can for food; and many
old <318 do faint by the way and die.

9:17 And the army <46 is with me is weak; and the <6479 of the
<55 are betwixt Sherrizah and me; and as many as have fled to the

how <9942 the Lord hath been unto the <502 of men, from the
<25373 of Adam even down unto the time that ye <45 <5183 <45
<46 and ponder it in your <27587

10:4 And when ye <18 <18 <18 <17 I <50 <74 you that ye
<6 ask God, the <5284 <213 in the name of <205 if <21
<196 are not <5522 and if ye <32 ask with a sincere <2713 with
real <4958 <1973 <1630 in <24 he will <2287 the <20754 of it
unto you, by the <1478 of the Holy <1468

10:5 And by the <12 of the Holy <2314 ye may know the <29 of all
<2850

10:6 And <3446 <1717 is good is just and <68 <418 <21859
that is good <1895 the <60 but acknowledgeth that he is.

10:7 And ye may know that he is, by the <54 of the Holy <5012
<2411 I <121 <127 you that ye deny not the <16 of God; for he
<16979 by <322 <1196 to the <109 of the <189 of men, the
same today and tomorrow, and <324

10:8 And <897 I <40 you, my <308 that ye deny not the <5745
of God, for they are many; and they come from the same God. And <921
are different ways that <181 <23 are administered; but it is the
same God who <70 all in all; and they are <328 by the
<21047 of the <1407 of God unto men, to profit <1201

10:9 For <688 to one is <24 by the <20 of God, that he may
<2438 the word of wisdom;

<14387 And to <13803 that he may <15 the word of <1320 by the
same Spirit;

<14364 And to <20 <1451 <1246 <11155 and to <6 the
<92 of healing by the same <22

<14352 And <138 to <17 that he may work <6092 miracles;

<14313 And <14 to <14 that he may <9682 <1385 all
<10725

<14267 And <16 to <16 the <22145 of <3518 and <4156
spirits;

<14230 And <16 to <16 all <15904 of <26559

<14190 And <12 to <12 the <21483 of languages and of
<4233 <19 of tongues.

<14147 And all <183 <91 come by the <142 of <664 and they come
unto <3918 man severally, <254 as he <19443

<14113 And I <281 <241 you, my <1256 <242 that ye <465
that <24 good gift <1842 of <529

<14115 And I <23 <23 you, my <23 <23 that ye <23
that he is the same <27399 <27399 and <24426 and that all <71
<72 of <726 I have <21293 <4 are spiritual, <3216 will be done
<1163 even as long as the <2797 <449 <3696 only <81 to the
<21098 of the <336 of men.

<14106 <2569 <301 must be <211 and if <6 must be <356 <4
must also be <3132 and if <8 must be hope <4 must also be
<3349

<14113 And <925 ye have <3259 ye can in <26419 be <2605 in the
<1612 of God; <1068 can ye be <11 in the <10 of God if ye
have not <61 <16 can ye if ye have no <3495

<14127 And if ye have no hope ye must <3409 be in despair; and despair
<164 <962 of <24474

<14124 And <849 <5776 said unto our fathers: If ye have <101 ye can
do all <590 <150 are <3972 unto me.

<14076 And now I <1838 unto all the ends of the earth—that if the day
<49 that the <503 and <185 of God <167 be done away <3045 you, it
<8 be <66 of <21283

<14086 And wo be unto the <179 of men if this be the case; for <158
<25 be none that <5235 good <35 you, no not one. For if <15 be
one <11 you that <16 <4408 he <23 work by the <65 and <65 of
God.

<14107 And wo unto them who <19 do <267 <111 away and die, for they
die in <1099 <1477 and they <1200 be <189 in the <189 of God; and
I <122 it <268 to the <838 of <363 and I lie not.

<14135 And I <331 you to <327 <47 <440 for the time speedily
<139 that ye <59 know that I lie not, for ye <8 see me at the
bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my
<58 unto you, <200 were <1078 by this man, like as one <15915 from
the <8851 yea, even as one <27841 out of the dust?

<14185 I <34 <73 <120 unto the <2234 of the prophecies. And
<612 they <67 <11163 <4658 out of the <4658 of the <2765
God; and his word <15 hiss <15 from generation to generation.

<14181 And God <13 show unto you, that that <75 I have <76 is
<21102

<14174 And <2231 I <469 <138 you that ye <5 come unto <808 and
lay hold upon <495 good <5473 and <21210 not the evil <6 nor the
unclean <4816

<14156 And awake, and arise from the dust, O <10805 yea, and put on
thy <15333 garments, O <17077 of Zion; and strengthen thy stakes
and enlarge thy <8796 <513 that thou mayest no more be
<10893 that the <4368 of the <966 <3488 <92 he hath made
unto <1247 O <10807 of <11140 may be <12646

<14159 Yea, come unto <91 and be perfected in him, and deny
<26995 of all ungodliness; and if ye <135 deny <9 of all
ungodliness and love God with all your <33827 mind and strength, then
is his <1242 <5748 for you, that by his <7 ye may be <2584 in
<298 and if by the <12 of God ye are <13 in <63 ye can in
<533 deny the <367 of God.

<14170 And <716 if ye by the <28 of God are <27 in <27 and
deny not his <952 then are ye <22132 in <506 by the <21 of
God, <3598 the <9123 of the <1478 of <26 <138 is in the
<10875 of the <147 unto the <2697 of your <399 that ye <1307
